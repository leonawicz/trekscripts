	FADE IN:

1    INT. BAJORAN CAVERN

	A place of meeting and meditation somewhere on Bajor. 
	The cavern floor is spotless stone and there are a few 
	simple religious ARTIFACTS around the cavern, including 
	a suspended CANDLEHOLDER which is UNLIT at the moment. 
	Five N.D. Bajoran Monks are sitting down cross-legged 
	on the floor around the artifacts in a position of 
	contemplation. Once they've settled, LATHA MABRIN 
	ENTERS the cavern.

					LATHA
			I am Vedek Latha Mabrin and I 
			welcome you to the Calash Retreat. 
			Today we begin prayer and 
			meditation in preparation for the 
			Days of Atonement. May the 
			Prophets walk with us as we begin 
			our journey.

	Latha sits on the floor inside the circle of Monks and 
	picks up a long ceremonial LIGHTER. He then leans 
	forward and uses it to light the long WICK of the 
	candle. The wick is more like a matchstick in that it 
	burns down quickly into the opaque glass base of the 
	candleholder itself.


	As the wick burns down, Latha takes his seat on the 
	floor, and closes his eyes in meditation. The other 
	Monks close their eyes as well.

2    INSERT - THE CANDLE

	The wick burns down into the glass base. When the flame 
	disappears from view, there is a beat and then 
	there seems to be a different series of several wicks 
	inside the holder hidden from view which are now lit, 
	giving a new flickering look to the glass base.

3    WIDER (OPTICAL)

	The Monks are deep in prayer when the candle holder 
	suddenly sends out SIX GLOWING BEAMS OF LIGHT. Each 
	beam focuses on the chest of a different Monk.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - TEASER     2.

3    CONTINUED:

	The Monks all open their eyes and there's a moment of 
	stunned surprise in the cavern -- is this a sign from 
	the Prophets?

	Five of the beams go OUT, leaving only one on the chest 
	of Latha.

4    LATHA (OPTICAL)

	He's surprised... seems to realize there's a danger 
	here just a split second too late as the candle holder 
	suddenly FIRES a disruptor BEAM right at his chest, 
	blowing him back across the cavern and killing him 
	instantly.

									CUT TO:

5    INT. SURGERY

	KIRA is on the biobed being examined by BASHIR, who has a 
	tricorder.

					BASHIR
 				(off tricorder)
			Have you been taking your makara 
			herbs?

					KIRA 
			Absolutely.
				(off his look)
			Mostly.

					BASHIR
			Kira, you have to take them. Your 
			progesterone levels are way too 
			low.

DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - TEASER     3.

5    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			But when I take the herbs, the 
			sedatives you gave me don't work.

					BASHIR
			The herbs do act as a counter-
			agent. But I thought you said you 
			weren't having problems sleeping
			anymore and you didn't need the 
			sedatives?

					KIRA
				(a reluctant admission)
			I don't. But Julian, those herbs 
			taste like something that crawled 
			out of Quark's ear.

					BASHIR
			Just take them.

					KIRA
				(reluctant)
			All right.

	ODO ENTERS from the Infirmary, a grim look on his face.

					ODO
			Major... may I have a word with 
			you?

					KIRA
				(glances at Bashir)
			Sure.

					BASHIR
			We're finished here.

	Bashir EXITS to the Infirmary.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - TEASER     4.

5    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			I'm afraid I have bad news. One 
			of the former members of your 
			Resistance Cell has been killed on 
			Bajor. Latha Mabrin.

					KIRA 
			How?

					ODO
			It appears a small hunter probe 
			was hidden in a ceremonial candle 
			and fired a disruptor blast.

	Kira takes that in with a mournful, but somehow not 
	surprised countenance.

					KIRA 
			Do they have any suspects?

					ODO
				(uncomfortable)
			Too many. Before he became a 
			Vedek, your friend was involved in 
			some... questionable activities.

					KIRA 
			He used to be a smuggler and an 
			arms dealer. I know. Latha used 
			to be a... violent man. But then 
			he found the Prophets. The last 
			time I spoke with him, he'd 
			changed -- really changed.

					ODO
			I don't doubt that, Major. But it 
			would appear that the violence of 
			his past finally caught up with him.

					KIRA
				(nods)
			Let me know if you hear anything 
			else?

					ODO
			Of course.

	She EXITS.

6    INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA

	Kira ENTERS the room from the corridor, a sad look on 
	her face as she heads for her room.

7    INT. KIRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

	As she ENTERS the room and heads for her small Bajoran 
	shrine. But before she can begin praying, the computer 
	voice interrupts.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Major Kira, there is one message 
			waiting for you.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - TEASER     5.

7    CONTINUED:

	Kira moves to the desk-top monitor.

					KIRA
				(to com)
			Play back message.

	On the monitor screen, a picture of Latha now appears. 
	In the photo, he's wearing his Vedek robes, but it's 
	clearly a file photo. Kira looks at the picture for a 
	beat in confusion, and then she hears a VOICE that has 
	been electronically scrambled to make itself 
	unrecognizable.

					SCRAMBLED VOICE
			That's one.

	(NOTE: there should be an audible beep to signify the 
	end of the message.) Kira sits up -- what's going on 
	here?

					KIRA 
				(to com)
			Replay audio.

					SCRAMBLED VOICE
			That's one.


					KIRA 
				(to com)
			Again.

					SCRAMBLED VOICE
			That's one.

	As Kira begins to realize that something deadly has 
	just begun...

									FADE OUT.

9    INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	Odo, Kira and SISKO are replaying Kira's message.

					SCRAMBLED VOICE
			That's one.

					ODO
			As you might've guessed, there's 
			no point of origin listed in the 
			computer log.

					SISKO
			When did we receive it?

					KIRA 
			It came in over the primary 
			subspace antenna at thirteen forty-
			one hours. That's almost the same 
			moment Latha was killed on Bajor.

					SISKO
				(to Odo)
			And you think this is a threat 
			against all the former members of 
			the Shakaar Resistance Cell?

					ODO
			That's my working theory, but I'm 
			not ruling anything out.

					SISKO
				(to Kira)
			Did anyone else receive this message?

					KIRA 
			Not that we know of. So there's 
			obviously some connection to me, 
			but I'm not sure what. I haven't 
			even spoken to Latha in two years.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT ONE    6A.

9    CONTINUED:

					ODO
			I'm waiting for the preliminary 
			crime scene report from the 
			authorities on Bajor before I 
			begin my own investigation. But
			I'd like to increase security here 
			on the station and initiate random 
			checks of all incoming cargo.

					SISKO
			Agreed.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT ONE     7.

9    CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA
			I've also contacted almost all of 
			the surviving members of the 
			Shakaar and warned them to take 
			precautions, just in case.

	He nods, they're doing all the right things. Sisko 
	moves to Kira for a moment.

					SISKO
			I'm sorry about your friend.

					KIRA 
			He died serving the Prophets. 
			They'll take care of him.

					SISKO
			I'm sure they will.
				(to Odo)
			Keep me informed.

	Sisko EXITS.

10   INT. REPLIMAT

	The next day. Kira is sitting at a table, looking 
	tired and trying to eat when O'BRIEN comes over.

					O'BRIEN
			How you feeling?

					KIRA
			Fine.
				(off his look)
			Exhausted. I didn't sleep much, 
			and Julian's got me back on those 
			herbs again.

					O'BRIEN
			I know. I could hear you pacing 
			all night.

					KIRA
			I'm sorry.

 DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT ONE 7A-8.    

10   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Don't be. I would've gotten up 
			and kept you company, but I 
			figured you wanted to be alone.

					KIRA
			I couldn't stop thinking about 
			Latha. All the firefights and
			bombings he'd lived through... and 
			then to get killed during a 
			religious ceremony...

	She shakes her head and trails off.

					KIRA
			You know, if I wasn't pregnant... 
			I'd be down on Bajor right now 
			looking for a way to narrow down 
			the suspects.

					O'BRIEN
			You're safer here on the station.

					KIRA
			That's what's driving me crazy -- 
			I'm sitting here eating breakfast 
			while someone may be hunting down 
			my friends. I'm a major in the 
			Bajoran militia, I should be down 
			there trying to protect them.

					O'BRIEN
			Well, right now you're needed 
			here... protecting someone 
			else...

	He looks down at her stomach and Kira knows he's right. 
	She smiles at him.

						KIRA
				(patting her stomach)
			I guess I do have my hands full at 
			the moment.

					ODO'S COM VOICE
			Ops to Major Kira.

					KIRA 
				(to com)
			Go ahead, Odo.

					ODO'S COM VOICE
			There's another incoming message 
			for you major, and they refuse to 
			give either their name or location.

	Kira and O'Brien exchange a look -- could this be the 
	killer again?

					KIRA 
				(to com)
			I'm on my way.

	As they move out...

									CUT TO:

11   INT. OPS (OPTICAL)

	Kira and O'Brien ENTER to find Odo and Sisko waiting 
	for them by one of the monitors near the Ops table. 
	Odo is working a console.

					ODO
			We're having trouble tracing the 
			signal.

					SISKO
				(working)
			They're running it through some 
			kind of scrambler and using a 
			phase-divergent carrier wave. 
				(to Kira)
			Try to keep them talking.

	Kira nods and steps in front of a monitor, O'Brien and 
	Sisko step back so as not to be seen by whoever's on 
	the other end of the call. Kira steels herself, then 
	reaches out and touches a control.

					KIRA 
				(to com)
			This is Major Kira Nerys. Who am 
			I speaking to?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT ONE    10.

11   CONTINUED:

	There's a beat and then a Bajoran woman named TRENTIN 
	FALA APPEARS on the screen. Fala is a soft-spoken 
	fifty-something Bajoran woman who's calling from her 
	home. She's petite and looks fragile, and at the 
	moment, she's very scared.

					FALA
			Nerys? Is that really you?

					KIRA
				(surprised)
			Fala?

					FALA
			Are you alone? I don't want 
			anyone to hear me. I think... I 
			think someone's trying to trace my 
			signal.

					KIRA
			Stand by.

	Kira taps the control again and Fala's image is 
	replaced by the station logo.

					KIRA
				(to Sisko)
			She's a friend. Her name's 
			Trentin Fala.

					SISKO
			One of the members of your cell?

					KIRA
			No.

					ODO
			Then why is she hiding her 
			location?

					KIRA
				(glances around)
			I'd rather not talk about it here.
			But trust me, she's no threat to 
			anyone. Let me talk to her alone 
			and see what's going on.

	Sisko nods and Kira moves to another monitor at the 
	Engineering station where she can have a little 
	privacy.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT ONE      

12   ANGLE ON ENGINEERING STATION (OPTICAL)

	As Kira ACTIVATES the monitor and Fala appears on the 
	screenagain.

					KIRA 
			I'm alone. And no one here will 
			trace your signal.

	That seems to calm Fala down a little, but she's still 
	pretty anxious.

					FALA
			You heard about Latha? They 
			killed him -- as he knelt in 
			prayer, they killed him!

					KIRA
			I know. The authorities are 
			investigating right now.

					FALA
			They're going to kill me too, 
			Nerys. They've been watching me.

					KIRA
			Who's been watching you?

					FALA
			I don't know. But I can feel it. 
			I need to get out of here... go 
			somewhere safe. Please, Nerys, 
			you have to help me -- you always 
			promised that you'd help!

					KIRA
			All right, calm down. I'll 
			protect you. You can stay here on 
			the station until this is over.

	Fala nods nervously.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			Two of our officers are returning 
			this afternoon from Starbase Sixty-
			three. I'll reroute them to Bajor 
			and have them pick you up. Okay?

	Finally Fala seems to relax a little.

					FALA
			Okay.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT ONE    12.

12   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Their names are Worf and Jadzia 
			Dax. They'll be in contact with 
			you within the hour.


					FALA
				(heartfelt)
			Thank you, Nerys. I knew I could 
			count on you.

					KIRA
			I'll see you soon.

					DAX
			Stop it.

					WORF
			I'm not doing anything.

					DAX
			You've been smirking ever since we

			Two bars of latinum. I hope you

					DAX
			I have it.

			No.

			Fine. I'll borrow it from Quark.

			Energizing.

	The normal Transporter EFFECT begins on the stage. For 
	a brief moment we can see the OUTLINE of Fala beginning 
	to form, then suddenly ALARMS start going off on the 
	consoles and Fala's form begins WARPING and TWISTING... 
	she appears to be writhing in agony.

					DAX
			There's a power surge in the

					WORF
				(urgent, working)
			Something is interfering with the

					DAX
			I'm transferring her pattern to 
			the secondary buffer.


					WORF
			Boost the gain on the energizing 
			coils!

					DAX
			It won't go any higher! I'm 
			losing her!

	They both look with horror at the transporter stage as 
	it FLASHES wildly with uncontrolled energy. Finally, 
	Fala MATERIALIZES on the pad -- but she's been horribly 
	burned and scorched. She crumples to the deck, dead. 
	Dax and Worf react with a mixture of revulsion and 
	grief at the sight...

	18   INT. RUNABOUT

	As Kira ENTERS what is already a crowded room -- Odo is 
	in the middle of briefing Sisko, while Bashir is 
	examining the body on the pad and Worf, Dax and the 
	N.D.s are running diagnostics on the equipment. 
	There's barely enough room for Kira as she squeezes by 
	the N.D.s and goes over to the transporter stage and 
	looks down at what's left of her friend.

					ODO
				(to Sisko, over above 
				action)
			I'm not certain. She could've 
			been wearing it or maybe even had 
			it implanted under her skin 
			without her knowledge. The 
			detonator could've been dormant 
			for a week or even...

	Sisko holds up a hand as he sees Kira, and Odo breaks 
	off. Sisko makes his way over to Kira just as Bashir 
	looks up at her. Odo, Dax, and Worf follow and Kira is 
	suddenly the focus of everyone's attention in the room.

					BASHIR
			I'm sorry, Nerys...

					KIRA 
			I'm hearing that a lot lately. 
			Can I have a moment... ?

	It takes Bashir a beat to realize what she means.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT TWO    16.

18   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			Of course.

	He gets out of the way as Kira stands over the remains 
	of her friend and bows her head in silent prayer. 
	Everyone in the runabout stops what they're doing out 
	of respect. Kira finishes her prayer and then turns to 
	face the others.

					SISKO
			I wish there was something I could 
			say, Major.

					KIRA
			Just tell me it was an accident.

					SISKO
			The constable thinks otherwise.

	Kira looks to Odo.

					ODO
			I believe she was killed by a 
			remat detonator -- a device 
			programmed to scramble a 
			transporter beam during 
			rematerialization. They're 
			typically no more than two cubic 
			millimeters in size, so it may 
			have been hidden in her clothes 
			or even injected under her skin.

					WORF
			That device is typically used by 
			the Romulans. However, they're 
			also sold on the black market.

					KIRA
			Why didn't the transporter 
			security system detect the device?

					DAX
			We're not sure. The system is 
			programmed to scan for remats. 
			So, whoever did this has a 
			sophisticated understanding of our 
			security protocols.

					KIRA
			And a vendetta against the Shakaar 
			Resistance Cell.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT TWO    17.

18   CONTINUED:	(2)

	The others look surprised.

					SISKO
			I thought you said Trentin Fala 
			wasn't a member of the Shakaar.

					KIRA
			She wasn't, at least not 
			officially. Fala spent the 
			occupation cleaning floors in the 
			Cardassian records office in
			Dahkur Province. She passed us 
			information for years without 
			anyone catching on.

	Kira turns and looks at the body as Bashir finally 
	covers it with a sheet.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			She was always so afraid... afraid 
			that she'd be caught and executed. 
			But she never stopped. I once 
			told her I thought she was braver 
			than the rest of us, because she 
			had to live with fear every day.
				(beat)
			Even after the occupation was 
			over, Fala never wanted anyone to 
			know she was secretly helping us. 
			She was worried that someone might 
			come looking for her... for 
			revenge.

					SISKO
			Looks like her fears were well 
			founded.

	As they all look down at the dead woman's shrouded 
	form...

	Revealing QUARK behind the bar, puzzling over a 
	Cardassian PADD, which is the source of the scrambled

					KIRA 
			Quark! What is that?

	Quark gives a guilty start and turns to face her.

					QUARK
			Major. Hello. I was just about

			in a shipment of Saurian Brandy

25   INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	Kira and Odo are trying to put the pieces together. 
	Just outside the door to the Promenade, we can see the 
	back of a Bajoran Security Guard standing watch.

					ODO
			Since she was an informant, it 
			stands to reason that Fala was 
			killed for providing information 
			to the Resistance... information 
			that the Shakaar used to plan an 
			attack on a Cardassian target. 
			The killer is probably someone 
			either injured or who lost a 
			family member or friend in that 
			attack.

					KIRA
			We planned dozens of attacks based 
			on Fala's information. It could 
			be any of them.

					ODO
			Not any. we're dealing with an
			operation in which you played a 
			prominent part. Perhaps you could 
			make a list of all the attacks by 
			the Shakaar that you participated 
			in... ?

					KIRA
			That's a long list.

	Suddenly all the monitors behind Odo's desk start to 
	flicker and flash with STATIC.

					ODO
				(off console)
			Someone's accessing the security 
			database.

					KIRA
			Can you trace it?

					ODO
				(frustrated)
			No.

	Odo and Kira watch as the static clears and all the 
	monitors display a file photo of a Bajoran man in his 
	late 30's named Mobara. Kira recognizes his face and 
	reacts with a sense of dread.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT TWO   24A.

25   CONTINUED:

				SCRAMBLED VOICE
			That's three.

					KIRA
				(re: photo)
			Mobara. He was in the Shakaar.

					ODO
				(urgent, to Kira)
			Where does Mobara live?

					KIRA
				(thinking rapidly)
			He's... in Musilla Province... at 
			the university -- the engineering 
			school.

					ODO
				(works the console)
			I'm sending an emergency message 
			to the authorities in Musilla. 
			Maybe it's not too late.

	Odo pauses for a moment and waits for a response. He
	glances up and sees the fatigued and worried look on Kira's face.

					ODO
			Are you all right?

					KIRA
				(snaps at him)
			No, I'm not all right. I haven't 
			slept in three days, someone's 
			killing my friends, and my back 
			feels like...

	She catches herself.

					KIRA
			Sorry.

					ODO
			No apology necessary, Major.

	The console BEEPS.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT TWO    25.

25   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
				(off console)
			They haven't been able to contact 
			Mobara. So they're sending a 
			search party to the university 
			right now. They'll let us know 
			what happens.

	That said, there's nothing further for them to do. A 
	long moment passes as Kira looks back at the photo of 
	Mobara on the monitor, then rubs her back in pain.

					ODO
			Major... if I may make a 
			suggestion? Why don't you go back
			to your quarters and rest for now? 
			It may take them several hours to 
			make a complete search.

	Kira struggles with herself for a moment, then decides
	he's right.

					KIRA
			Maybe you're right. But let me 
			know the second you hear something.

					ODO
			You have my word.

	Kira EXITS to the Promenade.

26   INT. PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS

29   INT. KIRA'S ROOM

	as she ENTERS. Kira goes to the bed, and sits down 
	with a weary look on her face. Suddenly she hears a 
	THUMP from the outer room and every nerve in her body 
	tenses. Then there's a CRASH, as if a piece of 
	furniture had been knocked over. She quickly moves to 
	a drawer and silently pulls out a Bajoran phaser.

	She moves to the door, stands next to the wall, slows 
	her breathing and prepares to take on whoever or 
	whatever is out there...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

30   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - KIRA'S ROOM

	Continuous from Act Two. Kira listens for any more 
	sounds coming from the living area -- nothing. She 
	touches the control pad and the lights in her room go 
	OUT... then she touches another control and the door 
	OPENS. The living area is now DARK as well.

31   INT. LIVING AREA

	As Kira peers around the corner of the doorframe into 
	the dark room. She cautiously steps out into the 
	living area, phaser at the ready, every sense straining 
	for some sign of the intruder. She creeps out into the 
	room, hugging the bulkhead to keep anyone from getting 
	behind her...

	Suddenly a MAN'S SHAPE moves out of the shadows almost 
	on top of her -- Kira whirls and points the phaser at
	his head at the exact moment he points a weapon at her 
	head.

			KIRA				FUREL
		Don't move!			Hold it!

	There's a beat as both of them recognize the other's 
	voice.

					KIRA
			Furel?

					FUREL
			Nerys?

	The lights in the room come ON, revealing FUREL is the 
	man pointing a phaser at Kira with his one arm. He's 
	one of Kira's former Resistance Cell comrades 
	established in "Shakaar."

	LUPAZA -- also established in "Shakaar" -- is the one 
	who turned on the lights. She's standing across the 
	room with a phaser at Brilgar, who's kneeling on the 
	floor next to her with his hands behind his head.

	There's a moment of relief as everyone relaxes.

					KIRA
			You're lucky I didn't shoot you.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT THREE   28.

					FUREL
			I could say the same thing.

			that with a phaser...

					KIRA
			I live here!

					LUPAZA
				(re: Brilgar)
			What about him?

					KIRA
			His name is Lieutenant Brilgar. 
			He's part of station security --
			here to protect me.

					LUPAZA
			Oh.
				(to Brilgar)
			Sorry.

	She lets him get up. Brilgar stands up warily and 
	Lupaza gives him back his phaser.

					BRILGAR
			You know these people, major?

					KIRA
			I'm afraid so. This is Furel and 
			Lupaza. We were in the same 
			Resistance cell.

					FUREL
			Brilgar. Sorry about the...

					BRILGAR
				(rubbing his neck)
			Yeah. I'll be outside if you need 
			me, major.

					KIRA
			Thank you.

	Brilgar gives Furel and Lupaza a last look and then 
	EXITS.

					KIRA
			How did you get in here? We just 
			installed a new security system.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT THREE   29.

31   CONTINUED:	(2)

					FUREL
			And it's a pretty good one... but 
			they haven't invented the security 
			system that Lupaza can't beat.

					LUPAZA
			It took some work, but I managed 
			to retune the transporter 
			scrambler.

					KIRA
			You beamed in? From where?

					LUPAZA
			We stowed away aboard a transport 
			ship making a run from Bajor. 
			Just before it docked, I accessed 
			the station personnel records...

					FUREL
			We beamed into...
				(indicates O'Brien's 
				room)
			... the other bedroom about five 
			minutes ago. We heard someone 
			moving around out here. I thought 
			it was you...

					LUPAZA
			But it turned out to be a man with 
			a phaser and...

	She trails off, a little embarrassed about the whole 
	thing.

					FUREL
				(re: Lupaza)
			I tried to tell her we should've 
			contacted you before coming.

					LUPAZA
				(hits him)
			You did not.

					KIRA
			I should have you both thrown in 
			the brig...
				(beat)
			But I'm glad you're here.

	She finally smiles and Furel gives her a hug.

					FUREL
			It's good to see you.

	Lupaza gives Kira a hug and silently tells Furel to go 
	get something out of the back room.

					LUPAZA
				(mouths the words)
			Go get it.

	Furel EXITS to the other bedroom. Lupaza stands back 
	and looks down at Kira's stomach.

					LUPAZA
			Can I... ?

	Kira nods and Lupaza puts her hand on Kira's stomach.

					LUPAZA
			How much longer?

					KIRA
			Another couple of weeks.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT THREE   30.

31   CONTINUED: 	(4)

	Furel ENTERS from the back bedroom carrying a small 
	box.

					LUPAZA
			Been sneezing?

					KIRA
			Off and on... my doctor's been 
			giving me something for it, but 
			before we get lost in baby-talk... 
			I got another message today. This 
			time it's Mobara.

	Furel and Lupaza exchange a grim look. Furel sets the 
	box down.

					FUREL
			Is he dead?

					KIRA
			We don't know yet. There's a 
			search party looking for him right 
			now.

	They take that in for a moment.

					LUPAZA
			Do you have any suspects?

					KIRA
			No.

					FUREL
			You let us know when you do...

					LUPAZA
			That's why we're here... to find 
			out who's doing this... and take 
			care of it.

	They just look at her and Kira realizes what they're 
	saying.

					KIRA
			I can't send you out like an 
			assassination squad.

					LUPAZA
			You don't have to send us 
			anywhere.

					FUREL
			Just give us a name and we'll do 
			the rest.

					KIRA
			The Occupation is over... we can't 
			just go around fighting private 
			wars. Times have changed... and 
			we have to change with them. 
			Leave this to the authorities.

	Furel and Lupaza can't believe what they're hearing... 
	they exchange a frustrated look, but then Lupaza 
	decides not to push it.

					LUPAZA
			Maybe you feel that way now. But 
			trust me... when you find out 
			who's killed Latha, and Fala, and 
			now maybe Mobara... you're not 
			going to want to leave it to 
			someone else. You're going to 
			want him dead... and you're going 
			to want us to do it.

	There's a great deal of truth to that and Kira knows 
	it. But at the moment, she wants to avoid that issue.

					KIRA 
			Maybe. But we're not at that 
			point yet.

	There's an awkward pause and Kira decides to change the 
	subject.

					KIRA 
			What's in the box?

					LUPAZA
			It's for you.

					KIRA
			For me... ?

	Lupaza picks it up and hands it to Kira who gives them 
	the "you shouldn't have" look then opens the lid. 
	Inside are bundles of fresh herbs. Kira reacts, not 
	happy about seeing these foul-tasting plants, but not
	wanting to show it.

					KIRA

			night.

					KIRA
			Thanks. Really, thank you.

	She puts the box aside.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			Well, if you're staying, I guess 
			I better find you some quarters.

			We're staying right here. Where

				(re: Kira's stomach)
			On both of you.

					FUREL
			We'll sleep out here -- that couch

	Sisko puts the PADD down in irritation.

					SISKO
			How does someone get close enough

					ODO
			I doubt he was ever near Mobara.

			Since the first word in all three

	On the computer screen, we see the voice print analysis 
	now focus in on the first word of all three messages. 
	It's a graphic of jagged lines and symbols. The

	Dax works for a second and then we finally hear what we 
	should recognize as Kira's voice.

					KIRA'S VOICE
			That's one... that's two... that's
			three... that's one... that's
			two... that's three...

					KIRA
				(stunned)
			It's me. He's using my voice.

	As they all take in the bizarre implications of that 
	discovery, suddenly an ALARM goes off on a console.
	Dax and Kira rush over to the console.

					DAX
			There's been an explosion in the

	is.

									CUT TO:

36   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	Kira comes pounding around a corner as fast as her 
	condition will allow and runs smack into the Guard seen 
	earlier outside her quarters. There are three more 
	N.D. Guards trying to seal off the area in the b.g. as 
	they keep N.D. Crewmembers and Civilians away from the 
	O'Brien quarters.

						GUARD
			Major! You can't go in. There's
			a hull breach and --

					KIRA
			Get out of the way!

	She tries to push past the Guard, but he won't be 
	moved. At this moment Brilgar comes running down the 
	Corridor and we get the feeling he's had a tough time 
	keeping up with Kira.

					GUARD
			I'm sorry, but I have my orders --

	He tries to restrain her, but she takes him out with a 
	well-placed jab and he staggers back. Another Guard 
	steps in her way, but Kira is operating on too much 
	adrenaline to be stopped and she takes him out, too. 
	Kira almost reaches the door, but Brilgar is right 
	behind her and he manages to get a hold of her from 
	behind before she can open the door. She struggles, 
	flailing against his grasp...

					BRILGAR
			Major -- no! You'll vent the
			whole Corridor!

					KIRA
			We have to do something!

	Kira throws an elbow and loosens his hold... but she's 
	pushing herself beyond what her body is capable of at 
	this moment. A bolt of agony shoots through her 
	abdomen.

37   INT. SURGERY

	Kira is lying unconscious on the table as Bashir leans 
	over and gently awakens her.

					BASHIR
			Nerys... Nerys... can you hear me?

	Kira begins to stir and then opens her eyes.

					KIRA 
				(weak)
			Julian...

					BASHIR
			You're in the Infirmary.
			Kira looks around and tries to focus.

					KIRA 
			The baby... ?

					BASHIR
			The baby's fine. 
				(beat)
			You suffered a placental 
			laceration... and then you began 
			to hemorrhage. But I've repaired 
			the damage and you're going to be 
			all right. 

	Kira is relieved, for only for a moment. She looks up 
	at Bashir grimly.

					KIRA 
			Furel and Lupaza... they're dead, 
			aren't they?

					BASHIR
			I'm afraid so.

					KIRA
			Miles?

					BASHIR
			He wasn't there when it happened.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FOUR   41.

37   CONTINUED:

	Kira closes her eyes for a moment, tries to keep the 
	pain of loss from overwhelming her.

					KIRA 
			Did they die quickly?

					BASHIR

			Instantly.

	Kira reaches up and takes the earring from her ear and 
	looks at it. There's nothing more for Bashir to say 
	and he doesn't even try. After a beat, Odo ENTERS from 
	the Infirmary.

					ODO
			Doctor, may I... ?

	Bashir nods and waves him in. Odo comes over to Kira 
	as Bashir EXITS to give them a moment alone. She 
	stares down at the earring in her hand.

					KIRA 
			I was thirteen when I joined the 
			Resistance. I'd been hanging 
			around the Shakaar base camp for 
			a few weeks, running errands, 
			cleaning weapons, that kind of 
			thing.
				(beat)
			One night they had an ambush 
			planned, but they were a man 
			short. I volunteered to go, but 
			everyone said I was too young, too 
			small. But Lupaza stuck up for 
			me... said I had the heart of a 
			sinoraptor and this was no time to 
			be choosy.
				(beat)
			Furel made some joke... I don't 
			remember what it was, but I 
			remember Lupaza hitting him -- she 
			always did that. They loved each 
			other in a way. But it was up to 
			Shakaar, and he stared at me for
			a long time before deciding that 
			maybe I was big enough to carry 
			a phaser rifle after all.
				(beat)
			So that night, we set up an ambush 
			on the ridgeline and waited. It 
			was cold and my hands kept 
			shaking.

37   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA (Cont'd)
			I was so afraid that the others 
			would see me and think I was 
			nervous, that I kept biting my 
			fingers to keep the blood flowing.
				(beat)
			We must've been out there for 
			three, four hours before the 
			skimmer appeared and set down 
			right where Furel said it would. 
			And when the hatch opened and that
			first Cardassian stepped out, I 
			just started firing. And I didn't 
			stop until I'd discharged the 
			entire power cell.
				(beat)
			When it was over, I was so 
			relieved that I didn't let anyone 
			down that I was almost giddy. 
			Furel kept telling me to stop 
			grinning, that it made me look 
			even younger, but I couldn't help 
			it. I was one of them -- I was in 
			the Resistance.
				(beat, re: earring)
			Lupaza made this for me... out of 
			some metal from that skimmer...

	A quiet beat as Kira squeezes the earring in her hand 
	and fights back the grief.

					KIRA
			How were they killed?

					ODO
			Someone attached a small hunter
			probe to the hull of a Talavian 
			freighter. When the ship docked 
			at the station, the probe detached 
			itself and then began a visual 
			scan of every room in the Habitat 
			Ring.
				(beat)
			Once the probe found its assigned 
			targets, it attached itself to the 
			window, and exploded.

					KIRA
				(nods)
			Do you have any leads?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FOUR   43.

37   CONTINUED: 	(3)

					ODO
			My sources on Cardassia have given 
			me a list of possible suspects. 
			All of them have the computer 
			skills, the opportunity and the 
			motive for carrying out these 
			attacks.


					KIRA
			You must've had to call in some 
			pretty big favors.

					ODO
				(understating the case)
			One or two.

					KIRA
			How many people are on the list 
			now?

					ODO
			Twenty-five.


	Kira's interest is piqued.

					KIRA 
			Can I see it?

					ODO
				(hesitates)
			Not just yet. I'd like to narrow 
			it a little further.

					KIRA
				(ruefu1)
			Afraid I'll take the names and go 
			charging out after them?

					ODO
			Something like that.

	She seems to give up and looks a little tired suddenly.

					KIRA
			You're right. I probably would.

37   CONTINUED:	(4)

			I'm going to find the person

					KIRA
			I know you will, Odo.

	She smiles at him and takes his hand.

					KIRA
			Keep me informed?

					ODO
			Absolutely.

	She closes her eyes as if weary and then Odo EXITS.

38   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	As soon as he's out of the room, Kira sits up and jumps 
	off the table. She moves to a computer console and 
	works it for a moment.

			Emergency transport standing by.
			Enter command code authorization.

39   INT. SECURITY OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	Kira MATERIALIZES in the empty office. She looks 
	around quickly, glances out onto the busy Promenade and 
	then sits behind the desk, grabs a PADD and begins 
	rapidly working both it and the computer console. Her 
	fingers fly over the controls, and we see computer 
	graphics and text race by on the screen in response to 
	her commands.

	After a moment, she seems to get what she came for... 
	she looks at the PADD with grim triumph and then she 
	SHUTS DOWN Odo's computer.

	She DEMATERIALIZES again. At that moment, Odo ENTERS 
	his office from the Promenade. He moves to the desk, 
	there's a beat, and then the ever-meticulous Odo 
	notices that the chair has been moved into a different
	position behind his desk. There's a beat, and then Odo 
	begins to realize what's happened.

	and a cool eye.

	Odo is outraged and Sisko and Worf aren't too happy 
	either.


					ODO
			She's obviously going after the

43A  EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)

	Silaran's house is a converted cargo container sitting
	on a barren, windswept plain.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FOUR   47.

44   INT. SILARAN'S HOUSE (OPTICAL)

	Kira MATERIALIZES in the middle of a dark living area 
	in a home fashioned out of a large cargo container. 
	There's a window through which we can see only dust 
	perpetually whipping up against the container by the 
	faintly howling wind outside. The cargo container is 
	lined with shelves which are filled with devices and 
	gadgets of every description. Computer equipment and 
	consoles are littered through the room and there's a
	work table against one wall. The comfort level here is
	minimal. Kira looks around cautiously, her phaser in 
	one hand and a tricorder in the other.

	She scans the room for a moment. Keeping one eye out 
	for anything that moves, she sets the tricorder down 
	and begins working one of the computers in the room.

	Suddenly a large N.D. Cardassian jumps out of the 
	shadows. Kira's instincts are faster, however, and she 
	whirls and FIRES her phaser.

	But the phaser beam GOES RIGHT THROUGH him and his 
	image FLICKERS for a moment -- he's a hologram!

	Kira reacts, realizes just too late what happened and 
	then she's HIT by another PHASER SHOT from o.s. She 
	slumps unconscious.

	As Kira lies on the floor, the form of another 
	Cardassian steps into view and looms ominously over her 
	helpless form.

									CUT TO:

45   INT. SILARAN'S HOUSE (OPTICAL)

	A few minutes later. Kira is being eased back into a
	chair in the middle of the room by someone o.s. (She's
	still wearing her uniform). The chair is lit by a pool
	of light in the otherwise pitch black room. Once she's
	in place, a RESTRAINING FIELD FLASHES ON over her body.
	The field will prevent her from moving anything below
	the neck.

	A Cardassian HAND comes into frame and applies a hypo 
	to her throat. In response, Kira slowly comes awake... 
	it takes a moment to reorient herself. She tries to 
	move, but can't. After a beat, she suddenly hears the 
	VOICE of Silaran somewhere in the darkened room.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/91/96 - ACT FOUR   48.

45   CONTINUED:

					SILARAN'S VOICE
			A creature born within the 
			comforting anonymity of darkness, 
			awakens in the harsh truth of 
			daylight. It squirms in the 
			glare, afraid of the light that 
			pins it to the chair like a needle 
			through its heart.

					KIRA
			Who's there? Silaran, is that you?

					SILARAN'S VOICE
			Its heart beats faster as panic 
			starts to creep into its soul. 
			Does it understand? Or is it so 
			blinded by the light that it can 
			think only of returning to the 
			velvet cloak of darkness? No 
			matter. Perhaps it is better that 
			it never realizes how close death 
			has come. But make no mistake 
			there is no escape. It has 
			reached the end, and soon it will 
			die.

	Kira looks about the room, starting to realize just how 
	desperate her situation is. Off her face...

46   INT. SILARAN'S HOUSE

	Continuous from Act Four. Kira glares into the 
	darkened room, looking vainly to see her captor.

					KIRA 
				(defiant)
			What's the matter, Silaran? Are 
			you so afraid of a pregnant woman 
			in a restraining field that you 
			have to hide in the dark?

					SILARAN'S VOICE
			It bares its tiny fangs, hoping 
			for a chance to strike, to sink 
			its teeth deep into the flesh of 
			its tormentor. But that chance 
			will never come...

					KIRA
			You better hope I don't get the 
			chance...

					SILARAN'S VOICE
			... and somewhere behind the gleam 
			of hatred in its eyes lurks the 
			certain knowledge of its impending 
			death. And it begins to know 
			fear.

					KIRA
			I'm not afraid of you. I'm not 
			some coward who's been sending 
			anonymous messages and bombs to 
			murder innocent people.

	Suddenly SILARAN steps into view -- he's a middle-aged 
	Cardassian man who's been horribly disfigured. Half of 
	his body, including his face, was severely injured in 
	an explosion about ten years ago. Cardassian doctors
	have done some reconstructive surgery, but his features 
	are still grotesque and twisted. His right arm is 
	still weak and he has a habit of touching each finger 
	of his right hand as if making sure that he still has 
	all five.

	Once he steps into the light, he drops the "story" he's 
	telling and addresses Kira directly.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FIVE   50.

46   CONTINUED:

					SILARAN
			No, Kira! I didn't murder anyone. 
			You did! You killed all of them.

	Kira plays it cool, pocketing the victory of having 
	brought him out of the shadows.

					KIRA
			There. That wasn't so hard, was 
			it? Now we can talk.

					SILARAN
			Talk and lies won't help you. 
			You're in the light... and the 
			light reveals the truth.

	He leans in close to her, so she can't avoid looking at 
	him. Kira looks him right in the eyes, doesn't flinch.

					SILARAN
			And the light shows me no regret 
			in those eyes... no compassion...

					KIRA
			You want me to feel compassion -- 
			for you? You've murdered five 
			people. What compassion did you 
			show to them?

	Silaran begins to pace around her in the light.

					SILARAN
			Unrepentant. How unfortunate. I
			thought you might've changed 
			through the years... might've 
			found a path out of the darkness.

					KIRA
			What am I supposed to be repentant 
			for? What're you talking 
			about?

					SILARAN
			That is part of your guilt. 
				(points to his face)
			You did this to me... and you 
			don't even know who I am...

	But Silaran is looking in the wrong place to find 
	sympathy.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FIVE   51.

46   CONTINUED: 	(2)

					KIRA 
			So you were wounded in an attack 
			I carried out when I was in the 
			Resistance. And I'm supposed to 
			feel guilty? It was a war, 
			Silaran -- fifteen million 
			Bajorans died during the 
			Occupation and you want me to feel 
			sorry for you?

	Silaran's own rage begins to boil to the surface.

					SILARAN
			No! I wasn't part of your war! 
			I was an innocent! I wasn't even 
			in the military. You know what I 
			did on Bajor? I was a servant! 
			I cleaned uniforms for Gul Pirak!

					KIRA
				(remembering)
			Gul Pirak... Commander of the 
			weapons depot outside Hathon.

					SILARAN
			I'm glad you remember. Now do you 
			remember what you did? How you 
			put a plasma charge outside his 
			bedroom window in the middle of 
			the night?

					KIRA
			I remember he executed fifteen 
			Bajoran farmers because they 
			refused to display the Cardassian 
			banner outside their homes.

	Silaran presses on, his fury taking hold of him.

					SILARAN
			Trentin Fala told you how to 
			defeat the security systems... 
			Latha Mabrin built the plasma 
			charge... Furel and Lupaza stood 
			lookout while you crept up to the 
			house.

					KIRA
			None of us liked killing. But we 
			were fighting for our freedom 
			against --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FIVE   52.

46   CONTINUED:	(3)

					SILARAN
			You vaporized the entire east wing 
			of the house! Twelve Cardassians 
			were killed, including Gul Pirak's 
			entire family. Twenty-three 
			others were crippled. Don't you 
			feel guilty? Don't you feel 
			ashamed of what you did?

	But Kira has her own rage and fury which nearly matches 
	his.

					KIRA 
			None of you should've been on 
			Bajor! It wasn't your world. For 
			fifty years you raped our planet 
			and killed our people. You lived 
			on our land and took the food from 
			our mouths, so I don't care if you 
			held a phaser in your hand or 
			ironed shirts for a living. You 
			were all guilty and you were all 
			legitimate targets!

	Silaran steps back in revulsion, hating everything 
	about the woman he holds captive in the chair.

					SILARAN
			And that's what makes you a 
			murderer. Indiscriminate 
			killing... no sense of morality... 
			no thought given to the 
			consequences of your actions. 
				(beat)
			That's what makes us different.

					KIRA
			I was a soldier. You're just a 
			bitter old man out for revenge.

					SILARAN
			I am bringing the guilty to 
			justice. And unlike you I take 
			care to protect the innocent. I 
			could've killed every monk in that 
			cavern or everyone on the
			runabout, or half the population 
			of Deep Space Nine, but I didn't. 
			Only the guilty have died. 
				(beat)
			And that's why even though your 
			actions have condemned you, the 
			life of your child will be spared.

	Silaran retreats into the shadows again. Kira's 
	apprehension level rises.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Darkness... " - REV. 11/01/96 - ACT FIVE   53.

46   CONTINUED:	(4)

					KIRA 
			What does that mean? 
				(silence)
			What does that mean?

					SILARAN'S VOICE
			The creature's diseased mind 
			cannot understand its plight... 
			its imagination is too limited to 
			perceive the truth. It cannot be 
			saved. But there is still hope 
			for its child. It can be taken 
			from the womb and raised in the 
			light.

	A chill runs down Kira's spine as she realizes what 
	he's planning to do. A note of desperation now creeps 
	into her voice.

					KIRA 
			Silaran, listen to me. The child 
			I'm carrying isn't Bajoran, it's 
			Human. It has unique medical 
			needs. If you try to force me to 
			give birth now you risk--

					SILARAN'S VOICE
			The creature's cries grow louder, 
			but no one can hear them. All 
			that remains is to bring the child 
			into the light... and discard the 
			diseased carcass of the mother... 
			before it can infect the offspring.

					KIRA
			You can't bring it into the light! 
			Not yet! Doctor Bashir said I 
			needed at least three more weeks 
			before--

	Kira breaks off as Silaran pushes a cart bearing 
	various medical DEVICES into the pool of light near the chair.

					KIRA 
			We both agree that this baby is an 
			innocent. Don't put him at risk. 
			Please, Silaran.

					SILARAN
			Don't worry. I promise that I'll 
			take care of the child... and that 
			I'll teach him the difference 
			between darkness and light.

46   CONTINUED:	(5)

	Silaran picks up a laser scalpel from the cart and 
	tests it -- a fine CUTTING BEAM comes a few inches out 
	of the scalpel for a moment.

	Kira is thinking as fast as she can... desperate for 
	some way, any way out of this... Silaran turns to Kira 
	and prepares to apply the scalpel to her abdomen.

					KIRA 
			Wait! Please, I'm begging you -- 
			at least give me a sedative -- 
			show some compassion! Don't just 
			cut me open!

	Silaran pauses and looks deep into her eyes for a beat. 
	He takes pity on her at last.

					SILARAN
			All right. I'll show more mercy 
			than you have.

	He turns to the cart, picks up a hypospray, makes an 
	adjustment to his hypospray and then leans in close to 
	Kira's face again.

					SILARAN
			Take a good look at my face, Kira.
			I want it to be the last thing you
			see.

	She looks up at his twisted features for a moment and 
	then he applies the hypospray to her neck. Kira passes out.

					SILARAN
			The creature slept, dreaming its 
			dark dreams and happy to be out of 
			the light. The innocent life it 
			held would awaken in brilliance, 
			and never know darkness again.

	He switches OFF the restraining field, and then picks 
	up the laser scalpel again. He points it at her belly 
	and is just about to activate it...

	When suddenly Kira comes out of the chair swinging and 
	we realize that she's been faking. Silaran lets out an 
	anguished scream as she hits him hard and fast... he's 
	knocked back into a table, grabs a large heavy piece of 
	computer hardware and swings it at her with deadly 
	force. Kira twists out of the way, stumbles, almost 
	falls... Silaran comes at her again and she just 
	manages to get to her phaser on the workbench. She 
	turns and FIRES just before Silaran could get a chance 
	to cave in her skull with the hardware.

	He falls to the ground, dead. Kira looks at him for a 
	moment, catching her breath and sagging against the 
	workbench.

	In orbit around the barren planet seen earlier.

48   INT. SILARAN'S HOUSE (OPTICAL)

	Sisko, Bashir and Odo MATERIALIZE in the room. 
	Everyone, except Odo, has a phaser out and ready. They 
	scan the room quickly, then relax when they see...

49   ANGLE - KIRA

	Sitting on a chair looking down at the dead body of
	Silaran. She glances up at them as they move to her. 
	Bashir whips out his tricorder and gives her a quick 
	scan.

					ODO
			Are you all right?

	She nods.

					BASHIR
				(off tricorder)
			She's fine. But there's a large 
			amount of merfadon in her system.

					SISKO
			Merfadon?

 					BASHIR
			It's a sedative... but the makara 
			herbs she's been taking have 
			counteracted the effects.

	Kira still hasn't made eye contact with anyone.

					SISKO
				(re: Silaran)
			I take it this is our assassin?

	She nods again.

					ODO
				(to Kira)
			Why did he give you a sedative?

49   CONTINUED:

	Kira speaks in a flat, dull voice, her eyes still on 
	Silarah and we get the feeling she's speaking more to 
	him than to anyone in the room.					KIRA
			He wanted to protect the 
			innocent... and separate the 
			darkness from the light. 
				(beat)
			But I don't think he realized that 
			a light only shines in the dark... 
			and sometimes innocence... is just 
			an excuse for the guilty.

	The others look at one another, wondering what the hell 
	that means. Kira finally stands up.

					KIRA
			Let's go home.

	A quiet moment.

					SISKO
				(to com)
			Sisko to Defiant. Four to beam 
			up. Energize.

	The five of them DEMATERIALIZE.
