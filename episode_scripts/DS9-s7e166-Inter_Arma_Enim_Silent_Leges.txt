	FADE IN:

1    INT. REPLIMAT

	BASHIR and GARAK are having lunch.

					GARAK
			Ah, Romulus. How well I remember
			it. You will find the
			predominant color to be gray.
			The buildings. The clothes. The
			people. Did you know that the
			Romulan heart itself is gray?
			It's true. And entirely
			appropriate for such an
			unimaginative race.

					BASHIR
			I take it you didn't enjoy your
			brief stint on Romulus. You were
			posing as a... gardener weren't
			you?

					GARAK
			One of the few instances where my
			cover proved to be more enjoyable
			than the actual assignment.

					BASHIR
			What was that assignment by the
			way?

					GARAK
			I'm afraid I can't talk about
			that. Back to the subject at
			hand. What will your role be at
			the conference?

					BASHIR
			I'll be giving a talk on Dominion
			biogenic weapons, chairing a
			seminar on Ketracel White, and
			attending a meeting on a proposal
			to transfer twenty-five
			Federation hospital ships to
			Romulan control.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - TEASER     1A.

1    CONTINUED:

					GARAK
			How dull.

					BASHIR
			Sorry to disappoint you. Admiral
			Ross and his staff will be
			discussing the "exciting"
			military issues.

					GARAK
			I see.
				(beat)
			I trust Starfleet Intelligence
			will be sending someone along to
			make good use of this
			opportunity.

					BASHIR
			What do you mean?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - TEASER      2.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK
			Isn't it obvious? This is a
			golden opportunity to gather
			intelligence on Romulan
			intentions and military
			capabilities.

					BASHIR
			They're our allies, Garak. And
			with a bit of luck, this could be
			the beginning of a entirely new
			relationship between our peoples.

					GARAK
			The eternal optimist.

					BASHIR
			Guilty as charged.

					GARAK
			How sad. I must tell you it's a
			bit disappointing to hear you
			mouthing the usual platitudes
			about peace and friendship
			regarding an implacable foe like
			the Romulans. But, I live in
			hope that someday you'll see the
			universe as it truly is, rather
			than as you wish it to be.

					BASHIR
			I shall endeavor to become more
			cynical with each passing day.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - TEASER      3.

1    CONTINUED:	(3)

					BASHIR (Cont'd)
			To look gift horses in the mouth
			and find clouds in every silver
			lining.

					GARAK
			If only you meant it.

	Establishing the station.

3    INT. BASHIR'S QUARTERS

	The middle of the night. Bashir is asleep in bed.
	Suddenly his eyes open. Something's wrong. He sits
	up and looks around. Someone is sitting in a chair
	on the far side of the room.

					BASHIR
			Lights.

	The lights come ON.

4    INCLUDE DIRECTOR SLOAN

	who is sitting in the chair, calmly watching Bashir.

					BASHIR
			Sloan...

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - TEASER      4.

4    CONTINUED:

					SLOAN
			Hello, Doctor. It's good to see
			you. I hope you're well-rested.
			Section Thirty-one has an
			assignment for you.

	OFF Bashir's face as he reacts in shock to seeing
	Sloan...

									FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)

5    INT. BASHIR'S QUARTERS

	As before.

					BASHIR
			You're taking quite a risk. I
			could have a security team here
			in thirty seconds.

					SLOAN
			I suspect you'd be unable to
			communicate with anyone outside
			this room.

					BASHIR
			I could scream for help.

					SLOAN
			Possible, but uncharacteristic.
			Screaming for help is too
			undignified for you. But don't
			let me stop you -- I enjoy being
			wrong.

	Beat.

					BASHIR
			What is it you want?

					SLOAN
			I told you -- you have an
			assignment.

					BASHIR
			I don't work for you.

					SLOAN
			You passed the test. You were
			accepted into the organization.

					BASHIR
			I wasn't asking to be accepted.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE      6.

5    CONTINUED:

					SLOAN
			You were nevertheless. Now it's
			time to go to work. I'm sure
			you're dying to know what your
			mission is, but you won't give me
			the satisfaction of admitting it.
			So I'll just tell you.

					BASHIR
			Lucky me.

					SLOAN
			Section Thirty-one is extremely
			interested in this conference of
			yours. However, the Tal'Shiar
			will be handling the security
			arrangements, so we have
			virtually no chance of using any
			technical assets to gather
			intelligence. As a result, we'll
			be forced to rely on organic
			assets like you.
				(beat)
			Your assignment is to gather data
			on the Romulan leadership. In
			essence, we want you to take the
			pulse of their government, no pun
			intended.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE      7.

5    CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			You're asking me to spy on an
			ally.

					SLOAN
			To evaluate an ally -- and a
			temporary ally at that. I say
			that because when the war's over,
			the following will happen in
			short order: The Dominion will
			be forced back to the Gamma
			Quadrant. The Cardassian Empire
			will be occupied. The Klingon
			Empire will spend the next ten
			years recovering from the war and
			won't pose a major threat to
			anyone. That leaves two powers
			to vie for control of the
			quadrant -- the Federation and
			the Romulans.

					BASHIR
			This war isn't even over and
			you're already planning for the
			next one.

					SLOAN
			Well put. I hope your report is
			equally succinct.

					BASHIR
			I don't know how many more times
			I can say this, but I don't work
			for you.

					SLOAN
			You will. It's in your nature.

	Sloan heads for the door.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE      8.

5    CONTINUED:	(3)

					SLOAN
			You're a man who loves secrets.
			Medical. Personal. Fictional.
				(beat)
			I am a man of secrets. You want
			to know what I know. And the
			only way to do that... is to
			accept the assignment.

	A long beat, and then Sloan EXITS. The second the
	door CLOSES, Bashir jumps to his feet, opens a
	drawer, pulls out a phaser and rushes to the door.

5A   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Bashir ENTERS from his door and runs into EZRI.
	She's come around the corner just in time to be
	brought up short by Julian brandishing a phaser.

					EZRI
			Easy Julian!

	Bashir stops, then looks up and down the Corridor.
	Sloan is nowhere to be seen.

					EZRI
			What's going on?

	Off Bashir's frustrated look...

									CUT TO:

6    INT. WARDROOM

	SENATOR CRETAK, WORF, KIRA, ODO and O'BRIEN are
	having a meeting. Kira is chairing the meeting and
	there's a noticeable coolness between her and
	Cretak. There are several PADDs in front of
	everyone.

					KIRA
				(off PADD)
			Item seven -- warbird repair and
			maintenance. Senator?

					CRETAK
			Repairs on our ships are
			continually being delayed in
			favor of Klingon and Federation
			vessels.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE     8A.

6    CONTINUED:

					CRETAK (Cont'd)
			The Dividices and the Genorex
			have been waiting almost three
			weeks while more than a dozen
			Klingon ships have been given
			first priority.

					O'BRIEN
			I make up the repair schedule
			according to my assessment of
			which ships have the greatest
			need.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE      9.

6    CONTINUED:	(2)

					CRETAK
			Odd that the Klingons seem to
			always have the greatest need.

					WORF
			They are usually more damaged
			because Klingon warships are
			relentless in pressing home their
			attacks.

					CRETAK
			Reckless would be another way of
			putting it.

					WORF
			The fight must be taken to the
			enemy. The war cannot be won if --

					KIRA
			We're not here to debate combat
			tactics. Chief, how soon can you
			get those warbirds to a docking
			bay?

					O'BRIEN
				(thinks)
			I suppose I could bring them in
			tomorrow and delay repairs to the
			Hornet and the Rotarran. But
			someone's going to have to
			explain to General Martok why his
			flagship got bumped.

					KIRA
			Worf, you just volunteered for
			that assignment.

					ODO
			This brings up the question of
			shore leave. At the moment, we
			have the crews from two Klingon
			ships on the station. I'd rather
			not have that many Klingons and
			Romulans on the Promenade at the
			same time.

					CRETAK
			We'll forgo shore leave until the
			Klingons depart.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE     10.

6    CONTINUED:	(3)

					CRETAK (Cont'd)
			Our soldiers are professionals.
			They're here to fight, not to get
			drunk in Quark's.

	Worf fumes, but Kira moves on.

						KIRA
			Then that's it for today.
				(to all)
			Same time next week? Oh --
			sorry, senator, you'll be
			attending the conference on
			Romulus won't you?

						CRETAK
			Yes. But Subcommander Velal
			will be here in my place.

						KIRA
			Fine. Have a safe trip.

						CRETAK
			Thank you.

	The meeting breaks up.

7    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	SISKO is talking with Bashir.

					BASHIR
			Odo's checked all the security
			logs -- there's no indication of
			how Sloan got aboard or where he
			went.

					SISKO
			Can't say I'm surprised. From
			what we've seen of them, Section
			Thirty-one is meticulous about
			covering their tracks.
				(beat)
			I spoke with Admiral Ross this
			afternoon. He and I agree that
			the Romulan conference is too
			important to cancel.

					BASHIR
			What about me?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE    11A.

7    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Starfleet promised to send its
			expert on Dominion biogenic
			weapons and Ketracel White to the
			conference. Since that's you --
			you go.
				(beat)

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE     12.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO (Cont'd)
			And we want you to carry out your
			"assignment." Make a few
			discreet observations on the
			Romulan leadership and wait for
			Sloan to contact you again.

					BASHIR
			Somehow, I don't think giving
			Sloan information is a good
			idea

					SISKO
			That was my instinct as well, but
			after talking to Ross I think we
			might have an opportunity here we
			can turn to our advantage.
				(beat)
			Officially, Starfleet Command has
			said they're appalled at the very
			notion that an organization like
			Section Thirty-one might exist
			and that they plan to get to the
			bottom of this entire business.

					BASHIR
			But unofficially... ?

					SISKO
			They've quietly pushed the
			investigation aside. Which means
			they either don't take Section
			Thirty-one seriously... or
			someone at Starfleet Command is
			protecting them.
				(beat)
			Either way, we now have a chance
			to get someone inside and I think
			we should take it.

					BASHIR
			So I play along... pretend I've
			decided to work for Sloan after
			all.

					SISKO
			When he contacts you to find out
			what you learned at the
			conference, make it seem like
			you've reluctantly come around to
			his way of thinking. Let him
			believe he's seduced you into
			helping him.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT ONE     13.

7    CONTINUED:	(3)

					BASHIR
			That shouldn't be too difficult.
			Sloan already thinks I'm so
			tempted by his offer that I can
			barely see straight.
				(beat)
			I better get packed. The
			Bellerophon leaves in three
			hours.

	Sisko nods and Bashir heads for the door.

					SISKO
			One more thing, Doctor.
				(he stops)
			Remember that this isn't a game.
			Section Thirty-one is dangerous.
			If Sloan suspects that you're
			really working for us...

					BASHIR
			I understand.

					SISKO
			Good hunting.

	Bashir EXITS with a wave of his hand. Off Sisko's
	troubled expression...

									FADE OUT.

8    EXT. SPACE - THE BELLEROPHON (OPTICAL)

	An Intrepid-class STARSHIP at warp.

9    INT. BELLEROPHON - MESS HALL (OPTICAL)

	A cocktail party is in full swing. A bar has been
	set up and the room is filled with Federation
	officers (including a few admirals), a few
	civilians, and a few Romulans. Bashir, ADMIRAL ROSS
	and Cretak are getting drinks.

					CRETAK
			A glass of Romulan ale, Doctor?

					ROSS
			The trade embargo has been
			officially lifted, in case you're
			wondering.

					BASHIR
			It hadn't crossed my mind,
			actually.

	Cretak gets him the drink. Ross lifts his glass in
	a toast.

					ROSS
				(re: ale)
			To one of the many benefits of
			the Alliance.

	They clink glasses and drink. Ross chokes and
	struggles to keep his composure. Cretak and Bashir
	handle theirs with more aplomb.

					BASHIR
				(joking)
			Shall I call for a medical team?

					ROSS
				(dry)
			No, thank you.

	He coughs and Cretak looks at him with a little
	amusement.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO     15.

9    CONTINUED:

					CRETAK
			Don't tell me this is your first
			taste of Romulan ale.

					ROSS
				(coughing)
			It... was... illegal...

					CRETAK
			That never stopped most of your
			colleagues.

	Ross finally coughs himself out.

					ROSS
				(recovering)
			I know. I may be... the only
			officer in the fleet... who
			didn't indulge on occasion.

					CRETAK
			Would you like something else?

	Ross eyes the drink, refusing to back off.

					ROSS
			I'll manage.

					BASHIR
			That's the spirit, sir. Never
			say die.

					CRETAK
			What an odd expression. What
			does it mean?

					SLOAN'S VOICE
			It's a line from an old Earth
			poem.

10   NEW ANGLE

	Revealing that Sloan has now joined them. He's
	wearing civilian clothes and seems perfectly at
	ease. Sloan's attitude has changed now -- he's more
	open, more voluble in his "cover" role. Bashir
	can't believe Sloan is here at all, but tries to
	hide his surprise.

					SLOAN
			Forgive me for breaking in, but I
			couldn't help overhearing and
			etymology is one of my hobbies.
				(to Cretak)

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO     16.

10   CONTINUED:

					SLOAN (Cont'd)
			The phrase "never say die" was
			originally from a nineteenth
			century poem based on
			Shakespeare's "Merchant of
			Venice." It has since passed
			into the vernacular as an
			exhortation never to give up, no
			matter what the cost.

					CRETAK
			Interesting.

					SLOAN
				(to Ross)
			Wendell Greer, Assistant
			Director, UFP Department of
			Cartography.

					ROSS
			A pleasure. I'm Admiral William
			Ross... this is Senator Cretak..

	Sloan shakes their hands in turn.

					SLOAN
			Admiral... Senator...

					ROSS
			And Doctor Julian Bashir...

	Sloan sticks out his hand, which Bashir takes after
	a beat.

					SLOAN
			Ah. The physician from Deep
			Space Nine.

					BASHIR
			That's right.

					SLOAN
			I've been hoping to meet you. I
			have so many questions about the
			Bajoran sector, the navigational
			anomalies, the transport patterns...
			could you spare a moment?
				(to others)
			Unless I'm interrupting... ?

					SLOAN
				(sotto)
			Try to play your cards a little
			closer to the vest, doctor.
			You're lucky they didn't see that
			look of shock on your face.

					BASHIR
				(sotto)
			If you've managed to attach
			yourself to the delegation, why
			do you need me?

					SLOAN
			All in due time. Now -- you have
			a lot of work do before we arrive
			at Romulus. There's a PADD in
			your quarters. Read it and I'll
			join you at twenty-two hundred.

	He slaps Bashir on the back and then heads off to
	speak with someone in the crowd.

11A  CONTINUED:

					ROSS
			"Mister Greer" certainly has all
			his ducks in a row. According to
			the Department of Cartography,
			he's been a mid-level bureaucrat
			for almost fifteen years.

					BASHIR
			It doesn't surprise me that he
			has a solid cover story. But I
			think it's too dangerous to allow
			him to participate in the
			conference or even to set foot on
			Romulus. We don't know what he's
			up to.

					ROSS
			On the other hand, if we move
			against him now, we'll lose any
			hope of penetrating Section
			Thirty-one.

	Ross thinks it over for a beat.

					ROSS
				(musing)
			His access at the conference will
			be limited to a few low-level
			briefings and seminars. It
			shouldn't be difficult to keep
			tabs on him...
				(makes a decision)
			If Sloan's here it suggests more
			than a simple intelligence-
			gathering mission. He's up to
			something and I think it's
			imperative to find out what that
			something is.
				(beat)
			We go forward.

12   INT. BELLEROPHON - QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	An N.D. Romulan is calmly standing in the middle of
	the room, bathed in a BLUE LIGHT.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO     18.

12   CONTINUED:

	The man DISAPPEARS and is replaced with the IMAGE of
	NERAL -- leader of the Romulan Empire.

					BASHIR'S VOICE
			Neral. Formerly Proconsul and
			now Praetor of the Romulan Star
			Empire.

	REVEAL Bashir and Sloan. Bashir is on the couch,
	while Sloan sits at a desk with a computer terminal.

					BASHIR
			Neral's ascension to the top post
			was confirmed by the Continuing
			Committee a little over a year
			ago. His immediate family was
			killed in a Klingon raid
			approximately twenty-five years
			ago. His hobbies include
			archeology and sociology. His
			favorite food is Delvan pudding
			and his pet set'leth's name is
			Pensho.

					SLOAN
			Very good. Total recall is a
			useful attribute for an
			operative.

	He works the computer terminal and the image of
	Neral DISAPPEARS and an image of CHAIRMAN KOVAL
	APPEARS. Koval is a heavy-set Romulan wearing the
	black tunic of the Tal'Shiar, with a lot of iron-
	gray in his hair. His deeply lined face looks like
	it would shatter into pieces if he attempted a
	smile.

					BASHIR
			Koval. Chairman of the
			Tal'Shiar. Section Thirty-one
			believes that he was involved in
			the death of Vice Admiral
			Fujisaki last year, but there's
			no proof.

					SLOAN
			The proof is buried somewhere in
			Koval's personal database, which
			puts it out of our reach for now.
			But believe me Doctor, the Deputy
			Chief of Starfleet Intelligence
			doesn't just die of "food
			poisoning."

	Sloan gets up and walks over to Koval, looking him
	right in the face -- the image doesn't react at all.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO    18A.

12   CONTINUED:	(2)

	We get the feeling that there's something very
	personal between Sloan and Koval.

					SLOAN
			I have to give him credit,
			though, it was a textbook
			operation. No sign of foul play,
			and certainly no sign of Romulan
			involvement. Very tidy...

	Sloan looks thoughtfully at Koval for a moment, then
	turns back to Bashir.

					SLOAN
			Koval's political status?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO     19.

12   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BASHIR
			Ambiguous. He hasn't been
			elevated to the Continuing
			Committee, which is usually a
			given for the head of the
			Tal'Shiar. His nomination is
			probably being held up due to
			Koval's opposition to the
			Federation Alliance, which is
			supported by a majority of the
			Committee.

					SLOAN
			Which, in turn, opens the door
			for your friend, Senator Cretak.
			She's an advocate for the
			alliance and she's been lobbying
			for that open seat.
				(beat)
			There's another rumor about Koval
			not contained in his file. We've
			heard he's ill. Something called
			Tuvan Syndrome.

					BASHIR
			I'm familiar with it. It's a
			neurological disease affecting
			mostly Romulans, Vulcans and
			Rigelians. It's degenerative
			and incurable at present.

					SLOAN
			If Koval is ill, he'll try to
			hide it. It's a weakness, one
			that could hamper his chances of
			being appointed to the Committee.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO     20.

12   CONTINUED:	(4)

					BASHIR
			Is that what you want from me? A
			diagnosis? What's the matter
			Sloan, doesn't Section Thirty-one
			have its own doctors?

					SLOAN
			Our physicians weren't
			genetically enhanced. They need
			equipment to make a diagnosis --
			equipment that the Romulans won't
			permit at the conference.

					BASHIR
			I'm not capable of making a
			diagnosis by simply looking at a
			man.

					SLOAN
			Your genetically enhanced friends
			determined that Gul Damar killed
			woman just by watching him give
			political speech. I'm sure you
			can do even better.

	Sloan hits a button and the image of Koval
	DISAPPEARS.

					BASHIR
			You're going to move against
			Koval, aren't you? You want to
			find a way to use his illness to
			keep him off the Committee...

	Sloan doesn't answer.

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT TWO 21-22.    

12   CONTINUED:	(5)

					BASHIR
			I suppose it would be naive of me
			to point out that interfering in
			the internal affairs of a
			sovereign power is explicitly
			forbidden by the Federation
			charter.

					SLOAN
			Without confirming or denying
			your speculation, I will say that
			if Koval comes to power, it'll be
			a disaster for the Federation.
			He'll argue for the Romulans to
			abrogate the alliance and
			negotiate a separate peace with
			the Dominion. And I shouldn't
			have to tell you what that would
			do to the course of the war.

					BASHIR
			That doesn't justify manipulating a --

					SLOAN
			Let's make a deal, doctor. I'll
			spare you the ends-justify-the-means
			speech and you spare me the we-must-
			do-what's-right speech. You and I
			are not going to see eye to eye on
			this subject so I suggest we stop
			discussing it.
				(beat)
			Our mission is reconnaissance. We
			won't be called upon to do anything
			more than that. So I suggest you
			get some rest. We'll be in orbit
			of Romulus by oh-six hundred and
			you'll need to have your wits about
			you.

	Sloan EXITS. OFF Bashir's concerned look...

	FADE IN:

16   EXT. ROMULAN CAPITAL (MATTE SHOT)

	The busy capital city of the Romulan Empire.

17   INT. ROMULAN FORUM

	A large, open setting that resembles an arboretum
	more than a government reception hall. The room is
	overflowing with plants and trees of every
	description, and there're even small fountains and
	ponds to be found here. Two large Federation and
	Romulan banners dominate one wall. Multiple doors
	lead off into conference rooms. Buffet tables have
	been set up and there are scattered chairs and
	tables throughout the hall.

	The hall is open all day, and is in constant use,
	with diplomats and soldiers constantly entering or
	leaving. The CROWD is a blend of Federation and
	Romulan attendees. The Romulans sport a variety of
	clothes, some military, some civilian and one or
	two Tal'Shiar mixed in.

	Bashir is carrying a plate of food away from one of
	the buffet tables and getting something to drink
	when he suddenly comes face to face with the real
	Koval. Bashir is caught off-guard by the sudden
	encounter.

					KOVAL
			Doctor Julian Bashir?

					BASHIR
			Yes.

					KOVAL
			I understand you were the officer
			who first identified the biogenic
			weapon known as the "Quickening."

					BASHIR
			That's right. On Boranis Three,
			in the Gamma Quadrant.

	Koval just stares into his eyes, as if reading
	something there. Bashir finds it somewhat
	unnerving.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    24.

17   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			I... don't believe we've been
			introduced.

	Koval stares for a beat before answering.

					KOVAL
			Koval.

					BASHIR
			Ah. It's a pleasure to meet you.

					KOVAL
			Why?

					BASHIR
				(trying to be light)
			Well, you've got me there. I
			suppose it's simply an expression.

					KOVAL
			And like most human expressions,
			entirely devoid of meaning. Can
			the Dominion's Quickening virus
			be replicated?

					BASHIR
			We've had difficulty recreating
			the exact RNA sequence of the
			virus, which is one of the
			reasons we've been unable to
			develop a vaccine. However,
			there are alternate methods of
			making vaccines which --

					KOVAL
			I'm not interested in the
			vaccine, I'm interested in the
			virus. Do you know how to
			introduce the Quickening into a
			population?

	A chill runs down Bashir's spine.

					BASHIR
			Basically...

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    25.

17   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KOVAL
			Good. I look forward to hearing
			your lecture.

	And with that, Koval walks away, leaving Bashir to
	stare after him. Cretak comes up to Bashir.

					CRETAK
			You're going to make a fine
			operative, doctor.

	Bashir tries not to appear as surprised as he is.

					BASHIR
			Pardon me?

					CRETAK
			The Chairman of the Tal'Shiar
			rarely speaks with anyone in
			public -- much less anyone
			wearing that uniform. Starfleet
			Intelligence should recruit you
			immediately.

	It takes him a beat to realize that she's being wry.

					BASHIR
			What makes you think I'm not
			working for them already?

					CRETAK
			Somehow, it wouldn't surprise me
			if half the people in this room
			turned out to be operatives.

					BASHIR
			You are joking... ?

					CRETAK
			It may be impolitic to say
			this... but there're those who
			see this alliance as merely a...
			momentary truce.

					BASHIR
			Are you one of those people?

					CRETAK
			I could ask you the same
			question.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    26.

17   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BASHIR
			In my case, you would get a firm,
			"no." But you've answered my
			question with a question.

	Beat.

					CRETAK
			I try not to predict the future.

					BASHIR
			What about Chairman Koval?

					CRETAK
			You tell me. You just spoke with
			him -- that's more than I've done
			in six months.

					BASHIR
			I take it you don't get along?

					CRETAK
			We have different views.

					BASHIR
			Which are... ?

					CRETAK
				(wry)
			State secrets.

	Bashir smiles.

18   INT. ROMULAN LECTURE HALL (OPTICAL)

	A short time later. N.D. Romulans and Federation
	personnel file into the room and take up seats.
	Bashir is going over his notes near a lectern set up
	in front of a wall monitor. There's one seat
	noticeably empty in the front row. When everyone is
	settled, Bashir steps up to the lectern.

					BASHIR
			Good afternoon. I'm Doctor
			Julian Bashir from Deep Space
			Nine and I'll be speaking to you
			on the subject of Dominion
			biogenic weapons.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    27.

18   CONTINUED:

	There's a murmur from the crowd and Bashir falters
	momentarily as Koval makes his way through the hall
	and takes the empty chair right up front. Koval's
	eyes bore into him and Bashir doesn't like the fact
	that the chairman seems so interested in his
	lecture.

					BASHIR
			I'd, uh... I'd like to start with
			an overview of the weapon that's
			become known as... the
			Quickening.

	He hits a control and the large monitor DISPLAYS a
	picture of a woman's face which has the distinctive
	markings of the Quickening.

					BASHIR
			This is an adult female
			inhabitant of Boranis Three. The
			markings on her face are typical
			of a humanoid infected by the
			disease, but not yet in the
			terminal stage.

	He hits the control again, and the picture CHANGES,
	now showing the same woman with a more advanced case
	of the Quickening.

19   KOVAL

	leans forward in his seat, very interested in the
	picture.

20   BASHIR

	watches Koval's interest with a growing sense of
	disquiet.

21   KOVAL

	seems to realize he's being watched and looks back
	at Bashir. His eyes are dead.

22   BASHIR

	is chilled once again by the man's gaze. He quickly
	goes back to his notes and tries to carry on.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    28.

22   CONTINUED:

			You can see in this next

			this is also marked by an
			increase in leukocyte

									DISSOLVE TO:

23   INT. ROMULAN LECTURE HALL (OPTICAL)

	Later. Bashir's lecture has just ended. The wall
	monitor has a complex schematic showing various
	genetic profiles and DNA sequences. Bashir is
	reaching for a glass of water as the crowd breaks
	up. A few people come forward to shake Bashir's
	hand. One of them is Sloan.

					SLOAN
			Very enlightening. You almost
			made it comprehensible.

					BASHIR
			Next time I'll do a lecture with
			hand puppets just for you.

					SLOAN
			I'm glad to see you still have
			your sense of humor.

	There's a beat as Sloan waits for the room to empty
	out a little more.

					SLOAN
				(sotto)
			I trust you noticed who was
			sitting in the front row.

					BASHIR
				(sotto)
			He approached me this morning,

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    29.

23   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR (Cont'd)
			He wanted to know more about the
			Quickening. Specifically,
			whether I knew how to replicate
			the virus... and how to introduce
			it into a population.

					SLOAN
			What did you think of his health?

					BASHIR
			Didn't you hear what I just said?

					SLOAN
			I heard you. Koval wants to get
			his hands on the Quickening.
			It's not news to me that the head
			of the Tal'Shiar is interested in
			biogenic weapons. Pull your head
			out of the sand, and take a look
			around, doctor. These are not
			nice people we're dealing with
			here. Now, answer my question.

	Bashir takes a beat to refocus himself.

					BASHIR
			His eyelids were slightly
			displaced, and there was
			noticeable weakness in his facial
			muscles -- possibly a result of
			compromised neuromuscular
			function. Also his respiration
			seemed irregular.

					SLOAN
			Bottom line?

					BASHIR
			He may have Tuvan Syndrome, but
			if he does it's in the very early
			stages.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT THREE    30.

23   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SLOAN
			How long does he have?

					BASHIR
			If he fits the normal profile...
			he'll begin experiencing a loss
			of motor skills in the next ten
			to fifteen years... with life
			expectancy somewhere in the
			twenty to twenty-five year range.

	Sloan thinks that over for a moment.

					SLOAN
			Are there any instances in which
			the disease accelerates without
			warning?

					BASHIR
				(thinks)
			It happens, but in less than five
			percent of the cases.

	Beat.

					SLOAN
			Is there anything that could
			trigger the acceleration?

	Bashir stiffens.

					BASHIR
			I'm not sure what you're asking
			me.

					SLOAN
			Never mind. Thank you, doctor,
			you've been very helpful.

	Sloan EXITS, leaving a very disturbed Bashir in his
	wake.

25   INT. BELLEROPHON - BRIEFING ROOM

	Bashir has just told Ross about his conversation
	with Sloan.

					ROSS
			This is unbelievable.
				(beat)
			Let's put aside -- for the moment
			-- that he's contemplating the
			murder of a high-ranking
			official. What the hell makes
			him think that the next head of
			the Tal'Shiar will be any better
			than Koval?

					BASHIR
			Sloan's more concerned with who
			gets the empty seat on the
			Continuing Committee. He's
			hoping that Cretak gets it.

					ROSS
			Hmm. Well, I have to agree with
			him there. Cretak, for all her
			abrasiveness, is at least a
			patriot.

					BASHIR
			How does that make her any
			different than Koval?

					ROSS
			If you saw the reports from
			Starfleet Intelligence that I
			see, you wouldn't ask that
			question. Koval would like
			nothing better than to see the
			Romulan banner waving over Earth.
			Believe me, doctor -- Chairman
			Koval is not someone we want at

	Ross takes a few beats to clear his mind.

					ROSS
			I'll have Sloan confined to

			may not solve our problem.

					BASHIR
			Sir?

					ROSS
			Has it occurred to you, that you
			and Sloan may not be the only
			ones here working for Section
			Thirty-one? For all we know, he
			could have a confederate
			somewhere in the delegation.

					BASHIR
				(thinking out loud)
			Sloan said that "our" mission
			would be strictly
			reconnaissance... and that "we"
			wouldn't be called on to do
			anything else. That could
			suggest another operative...
			someone whose mission isn't
			limited to reconnaissance...

					ROSS
			If that's true, it could be
			anyone. Even a member of the
			Bellerophon crew.

					BASHIR
				(realizing)
			Or a Romulan.

25   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ROSS
			What?

	Bashir is putting it together.

					BASHIR
			I think Sloan has an accomplice
			somewhere on Romulus.

					ROSS
			What makes you say that?

					BASHIR
			Two things. First, Sloan has too
			much information on the inner
			workings of their government, too
			many insights into their
			political process.
				(beat)
			Second, Sloan's plan is to kill
			Koval while making it appear to
			be an accelerated case of Tuvan
			Syndrome. To do that, he'd have
			to expose Koval to a short burst
			of nadion radiation. The
			simplest plan would be to
			maneuver Koval near a phaser
			relay and surreptitiously
			irradiate him.
				(beat)
			Since I doubt very much that
			Sloan will have a chance to do
			that, it stands to reason that
			someone else will have to do it

			A Romulan...

			Sir, Sloan may have already set

					ROSS
			And how am I supposed to explain

			Romulans? All hell would break
			loose if they hear that a rogue
			Federation agency is running
			around plotting assassinations.
			It could bring down the Alliance.

			Besides, all we have is

					BASHIR
			Admiral --

			The answer is no.

			Now, after I have Sloan arrested,
			I'll break radio silence and

					BASHIR
			I'm going to try to convince

	The moment hangs in the air -- is Bashir about to
	accuse him?

					BASHIR
			Think about it. We're in the

	Bashir smiles sheepishly as if feeling ridiculous.

					BASHIR
			You're probably right.

					SLOAN
			Now what else is on your mind?

					BASHIR
			I'm not convinced that Koval
			actually has Tuvan Syndrome. His
			"symptoms" could be the result of
			any of fifty other health
			problems.

					SLOAN
			You didn't say that before.

					BASHIR
			I'm not an expert on Romulan
			physiology. Most of my knowledge
			regarding Tuvan Syndrome comes
			from studies done on Vulcan
			patients.

					SLOAN
			I thought Vulcans and Romulans
			were virtually identical.

					BASHIR
			Yes, but there are some important

			more I study the available data
			on Romulan physiology, the less
			sure I am that I've correctly
			diagnosed his condition.

	Sloan is bothered by that.

					SLOAN
			How could you find out for sure?

					BASHIR
			The best way would be to do an

	to a mobile cart of equipment. The door slides CLOSED

			Yes. For all our differences, I

	Neral looks over at Cretak for a beat.

					NERAL
			Continue.

					BASHIR
			Well... for reasons that are

			Senator to obtain the database so
			we could unmask this person and

					NERAL
				(to Cretak)
			Why didn't you come to me with

					CRETAK
			I... was afraid that if word of
			this... plot got out it would
			destroy the Alliance. So I
			decided to keep my own counsel.
				(beat)
			I regret that decision.

	Neral likes Cretak and his response is more in
	sorrow than in anger.

					NERAL
			As well you should, Kimara.

	There's a beat as the Committee murmurs amongst
	itself. Then Koval steps forward.

			It's an interesting story. But

45   CONTINUED:

					KOVAL
			Praetor, this is the man known
			as Sloan. Unlike the Doctor, his
			mind is quite susceptible to our
			data retrieval methods. Under
			questioning, he has confirmed
			much of what the doctor and the
			senator have told you. With one
			important exception.
				(beat)
			There is no Section Thirty-one.

	That gets everyone's attention.

					KOVAL
			Sloan, in fact, works for
			Starfleet Intelligence. Far from
			being the master of a rogue
			agency, he is simply one of many
			operatives in the employ of the
			Federation. He's had a long
			career, most of which is still
			unknown to us. However, there is
			one interesting element that we
			do know -- he was the protege of
			The late Vice Admiral Fujisaki.

	Sloan lifts his eyes and focuses on Koval. They
	burn with hatred. Bashir feels like the walls are
	closing in on him -- what the hell is going on here?

					KOVAL
			Sloan did not take the death of
			his mentor well. He came to
			believe that he was murdered --
			by the Tal'Shiar. In his eyes,
			the assassination of a Starfleet
			admiral was... "stepping over the
			line."
				(to Sloan)
			Isn't that the phrase?

	Sloan glares at him, unwilling to respond.

					KOVAL
			After Fujisaki's death, he was
			confronted with a dilemma: how
			could he seek vengeance without
			violating Federation law? His
			answer was to invent Section
			Thirty-one -- a "rogue"
			organization that answered to no
			one.

			If they killed the head of the
			Tal'Shiar, Starfleet Intelligence
			would be held blameless
				(beat)
			As the Committee knows, I have
			been diagnosed with Tuvan
			Syndrome. Sloan became aware of
			my condition and hoped to make my
			death look like a sudden
			acceleration of the disease. To
			do that, he needed a doctor. So
			ten days after Fujisaki's death,
			Sloan arranged to "recruit"
			Doctor Bashir into Section Thirty-
			one.
				(beat)
			After that, Sloan bided his time,
			and waited for an opportunity to
			present itself. He found one
			when he learned of this
			conference. He then arranged for
			Bashir to be invited. Everything
			was going perfectly. But then he
			made a fatal mistake -- he
			decided to come to Romulus
			himself. He was unaware that his
			identity had become known to us.
			Once we recognized him in the
			delegation, we knew immediately
			that an intelligence operation
			was underway.

	Koval moves over to Sloan, looks him over with
	curiosity.

					KOVAL
			What I don't understand is why?
			Why come here and take the risk
			of being discovered?

	Sloan glares at him for a long beat before answering.

					SLOAN
			I had to make sure nothing went
			wrong. And... I wanted to watch
			you die.

					KOVAL
			You broke the cardinal rule of
			our profession -- you allowed

					CRETAK
			That is a lie. I was trying to

					ROSS
			Dismissed from the Senate --
			definitely. Imprisoned -- most
			likely.

					BASHIR
			Executed?

					ROSS
			I hope not.

					BASHIR
				(harsh)
			You set her up! She was an
			innocent woman and you let Sloan
			destroy her! Why? She believed
			in the Alliance -- she was on our
			side!

					ROSS
			No. She wasn't. I told you
			before, Julian, she's a patriot.
			Which means that if it served the
			interests of the Romulans to
			negotiate a separate peace with
			the Dominion... Cretak would've
			pushed for that option. And,
			believe me, the Dominion would
			like nothing better than to make
			a deal with the Romulans right
			now.

					BASHIR
			So Koval becomes your guarantee
			that that won't happen. As a man
			who was nearly "killed" for his
			anti-Federation activities, his

					BASHIR
				(heated)
			That's a glib answer. And it's a

	Beat.

			Inter arma enim silent leges.

					BASHIR
			"In time of war, the law falls
			silent." Cicero. So is that
			what we've become -- a twenty-
			fourth century Rome? Driven by
			nothing more than the certainty
			that Caesar can do no wrong?

	Ross doesn't answer. He just picks up his combadge
	and puts it back on.

					ROSS
			This conversation never happened.
			You're dismissed.

	Bashir picks up his combadge and heads for the door.

									CUT TO:

48   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing the station.

49   INT. BASHIR'S QUARTERS

	It's the middle of the night and Bashir is sound
	asleep when he senses that someone is here again.
	He sits up and notes the silhouette by the window.

	Reveal Sloan sitting there once again.

					SLOAN
			Good evening.

					BASHIR
			Are you expecting applause? Did
			you come to take a bow?

					SLOAN
			I just wanted to say thank you.

					BASHIR
			For what? My allowing you to
			manipulate me so completely.

					SLOAN
			For being a decent human being.
			That's why we selected you in the
			first place, Doctor.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inter Arma... " - REV. 01/08/99 - ACT FIVE    61.

49   CONTINUED:

					SLOAN (Cont'd)
			We needed someone who wanted to
			play the game, but who'd only go
			so far. When the time came, you
			stood your ground and did the
			right thing -- you reached out to
			an enemy, told her the truth, and
			tried to stop a murder.
				(beat)
			The Federation needs men like you,
			doctor. Men of conscience. Men
			of principle. Men who can sleep
			at night.
				(beat)
			You're also the reason Section
			Thirty-one exists -- someone has
			to protect men like you from a
			universe that doesn't share your
			sense of right and wrong.

					BASHIR
			Am I supposed to feel sorry for
			you, Sloan? Should I weep over
			the burdens you're forced to
			carry to protect the rest of us?

	Sloan smiles a little and gets up.

					SLOAN
			It's an honor to know you. Sweet
			dreams.

	Sloan EXITS. Bashir quickly hits the com-panel near
	his bed.

					BASHIR
				(to com)
			Bashir to Security.

					ODO'S COM VOICE
			Odo here.

	Bashir hesitates, seems to realize the futility of
	what he's doing.

					BASHIR
				(to com)
			Nevermind. My mistake.

	He lies back in bed... but can't go to sleep...

									FADE OUT.
