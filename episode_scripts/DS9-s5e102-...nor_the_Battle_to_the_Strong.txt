	traveling at warp.

2    INT. RUNABOUT

	BASHIR is in the pilot's chair, absently guiding 
	the craft; JAKE sits nearby. Since the last time we saw 
	him, Jake has taken to wearing CLOTHES he considers 
	more adult. This might involve more muted colors, and 
	maybe a layered look that includes a vest.

					BASHIR
			-- I knew my paper would be 
			controversial, but I had no idea 
			it was going to turn the entire 
			conference upside-down. Believe 
			me, Jake, panel discussions 
			are usually a lot 
			more civilized than that.

					JAKE
			I don't know... they seemed polite
			enough to me.

					BASHIR 
			That was just a veneer. 
				(secretly pleased) 
			My paper stepped on quite a few 
			toes. It's heresy to even 
			consider the possibility that 
			prion replication could be 
			inhibited by quantum resonance 
			effects.

	Bashir glances over at Jake...

					BASHIR
			Aren't you going to take notes?

	The truth is, Jake is less than enthusiastic about 
	Bashir's story and doesn't see much point in taking 
	notes.

					JAKE
			Good idea...

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - TEASER       1A.

2    CONTINUED:

	Jake pulls out a small PADD and STYLUS...

					BASHIR 
			According to the so called 
			"experts," it's all a matter of 
			amino acid re-sequencing and 
			disulfide shuffling -- quantum 
			dynamics has nothing to do with 
			it.

	Jake jots something down, and we HEAR his thoughts as 
	he writes.

					JAKE (V.O.)
			I have absolutely no idea what 
			he's talking about.

					BASHIR 
			But how can that be? After all, 
			peptide bonds can be reconfigured 
			on a quantum level.

	During the following, Jake will stand and move away. 
	A beat later, Bashir will move to his side, determined 
	to keep his attention.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... - REV. 08/21/96 - TEASER       2.

CONTINUED:	(2)

	(NOTE: it's not necessary to allot enough time for Jake 
	to physically write everything indicated in the script. 
	We can assume his notes are shorthand versions of his 
	thoughts.)

	The following dialog OVERLAPS, though Bashir's words 
	drop into the background so we can hear Jake clearly as 
	he writes.

	Jake's interrupted when Bashir asks --

					BASHIR
			Do you follow so far?

					JAKE
			Sort of...

					BASHIR 
			Good. Because they're the key --
			the protein anomalies.

					JAKE (V. 0.) 
				(scribbling) 
			Who cares about anomalies!

	As he writes, Jake occasionally nods at Bashir as if 
	he's listening intently:

	An urgent BEEP from the com-system interrupts both men. 
	Bashir reaches and works the controls.

					BASHIR
				(off console) 
			It's a distress call from the 
			Federation colony on Ajilon Prime.
				(reading on) 
			They're under attack -- the 
			Klingons have landed troops.

	Jake and Bashir share a grim look --

					JAKE
			So much for the cease-fire.

					BASHIR
				(off console) 
			The main hospital's been 
			damaged... they're short on 
			doctors, running low on 
			supplies...

	Bashir lets out a frustrated breath...

					JAKE 
			What are we waiting for? Let's 
			go.

					BASHIR
				(hesitating) 
			It's risky. The hospital's only 
			fifty kilometers from the front 
			lines.

					JAKE 
			You put yourself into dangerous 
			situations all the time.

					BASHIR 
			Maybe, but that's not the same as 
			putting you into one.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - TEASER      4.

2    CONTINUED:	(5)

					JAKE
			Don't worry about me.

					BASHIR
				(wry)
			You're too young to die.

					JAKE
			I'm eighteen.

	Jake realizes how this must've sounded.

					JAKE
			You know what I mean.
				(pressing on)
			I've been on the station when it
			was under attack plenty of times.
			I can handle myself. I'm a Sisko.

	Jake senses Bashir wants to say yes, keeps at him.

					JAKE
			Lives are at stake. Those people
			need you.

	Bashir considers for a beat, then reaches and works the 
	controls.

					BASHIR
			I hope I don't regret this...

	Jake suppresses a smiles as he realizes he's going to 
	get his story after all.

					BASHIR
			I can only imagine what your
			father's going to say...

					JAKE
			He'll understand.

					BASHIR
			I'll get you out of there as soon
			as reinforcements arrive.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - TEASER      5.

2    CONTINUED:	(6)

	A beat, then Bashir smiles slyly.

					BASHIR
			I wouldn't want you to miss the 
			deadline on your story. 
				(kidding) 
			Did they want a picture of me?

	Jake smiles...

					BASHIR
			Anyway, about those quantum scans
			I was telling you about --

	Jake clears the PADD's screen.

6    INT. OPS

	We open on an improbable sight: DAX, WORF, O'BRIEN and 
	ODO are standing in a circle around KIRA, who's just 
	taken a glass MUG off a TRAY proffered by QUARK.

					ODO
				(re: the drink) 
			What is it?

					QUARK
				(pleased with himself) 
			The chief asked me to come up with 
			a decaffeinated raktajino for 
			Kira. I'm thinking of marketing 
			it.

	All watch as Kira takes a sip from the mug...

					WORF 
			Well... ?

					KIRA
				(grimacing) 
			Ugh... it's awful.

	O'Brien seems to take this personally.

					O'BRIEN 
			Give it a chance.

	Kira shakes her head -- no way.

					O'BRIEN 
			Let me taste.

	He grabs the mug from her, takes a big swig. He puts 
	up a valiant struggle to keep from spitting up. 
	Finally...

					O'BRIEN
				(gagging) 
			Quark.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE       

6    CONTINUED:

					QUARK 
			I did the best I could. The 
			removal of caffeine from beverages 
			has plagued bartenders and 
			restauranteurs for centuries; you 
			can't expect me to solve it 
			overnight.

	O'Brien slams the mug onto Quark's tray.

					O'BRIEN 
				(to Quark) 
			I'm not paying for this.

					ODO 
			So much for "Quark"-tajino...

					O'BRIEN
			I wanted to get her off caffeine, 
			not poison her.

					KIRA 
			You make me sound like some sort 
			of addict.

					DAX 
			She only has maybe two raktajinos 
			a day.

					O'BRIEN
			I just don't want my son to be 
			born with a caffeine habit, that's 
			all.

					DAX 
			You're being ridiculous. 
				(to Kira) 
			Why does pregnancy always make men 
			hysterical?

					O'BRIEN
				(to Dax) 
			Excuse me, this isn't the first 
			baby I've had.

					KIRA 
			Excuse me, Keiko carried Molly.

					DAX 
			It's not up to you to tell Kira 
			what she can and can't do.

					WORF
			She is carrying his child, he 
			should have some say.

	The battle lines are forming across the proverbial 
	gender divide...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE      8.

6    CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
				(agreeing) 
			As the lessee, he does have 
			certain rights.
				(off Kira's blank look) 
			Back home, pregnancy is considered 
			a rental.

					KIRA/DAX
				(outraged) 
			Rental?

	Before it can get more heated, SISKO ENTERS from his 
	office -- the conversation is cut short when everyone 
	sees the look of concern on his face.

					ODO 
			Something wrong, Captain?

					SISKO
			I just talked to Doctor Bashir. 
			He's on his way to Ajilon Prime to 
			answer a request for medical 
			assistance.

					KIRA
				(realizing)
			Jake's with him...

	Everyone reacts, suddenly understanding Sisko's 
	concern.

					SISKO
				(nods)
			According to the latest reports, 
			Klingon ground troops have already 
			captured two settlements in the
			northern hemisphere.

					WORF 
			Half the colonists are still 
			trapped on the planet -- there are 
			no ships in the area to evacuate 
			them.

					O'BRIEN
				(frustrated) 
			We're three days away, at best.

					SISKO 
			The Farragut will be there the day 
			after tomorrow. Bashir said he 
			and Jake would leave as soon as 
			relief teams are in place.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE      9.

6    CONTINUED:	(3)

	Dax tries to reassure Sisko that it's going to be all 
	right.

					DAX 
			In that case they'll be home by 
			Thursday.
				(smiling) 
			Doesn't leave you much time to 
			snoop through Jake's things.

	Sisko musters a smile, tries to push the worry from his 
	mind. Off this moment...

7    EXT. SPACE - AJILON PRIME (STOCK/OPTICAL)

	The Runabout entering orbit of the planet.

7A   INT. RUNABOUT

	Bashir is piloting the craft, Jake is ENTERING from the 
	back with CARRYING CASES containing medical equipment.

					JAKE 
			Ready to beam down?

					BASHIR 
			We can't leave the runabout in 
			orbit, not with the Klingons 
			around. Besides, the colonists 
			moved what was left of their 
			medical equipment underground when
			the hospital was destroyed. The 
			rock-face contains magnesite... 
			there's no way to transport 
			through it.

					JAKE
				(studying the monitor) 
			Guess we'll have to find a place 
			to set down.

					BASHIR
				(off console) 
			Looks like there's a clearing 
			about a kilometer from the main 
			settlement.

	A beat as Bashir works the controls... he's sensed that 
	Jake is almost eager about what's to come, decides to 
	warn him.

					BASHIR
			Jake... things could get a little 
			rough down there. They've got a 
			lot of wounded.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE     9A.

7A CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			I'll be all right.

	Bashir studies Jake's face, decides to believe him...

8    INT. CAVERN - TRIAGE AREA

	This is the entrance to the makeshift hospital that's 
	been set up underground. It's a sort of natural 
	hallway with SUPPORT STRUCTURES and power CONDUITS 
	lining the rockface.

	Harried looking medical personnel move among the 
	wounded, performing triage. It's chaos -- bloodied 
	bodies are being rushed in on stretchers, doctors are 
	barking orders to nurses and orderlies, wounded people 
	are crying out for help...

	This is a Federation colony comprised mostly of humans, 
	with a sprinkling of Federation aliens. The wounded 
	are a mix of Starfleet officers and civilian colonists, 
	including a few children.

	The medical team is non-Starfleet -- they wear scrubs 
	over their civilian clothes. Four of them have 
	speaking parts: KIRBY, an orderly, is a human male not 
	much older than Jake. KALANDRA, the head doctor, is a 
	human woman of about forty. The BOLIAN, an orderly, is 
	male, about thirty. The NURSE is human, a female in 
	her late twenties.

8A CLOSE - A STRETCHER

	as its brought in through the main entrance by the 
	Bolian and his partner.

					BOLIAN 
			We've got more wounded coming in... 
			another hopper just landed.

8B   PAN UP TO JAKE

	as he reacts to the wounded patient --

					NURSE
				(in background) 
			I need that plasma!

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE     10.

8C   MOVE TO REVEAL

	Bashir standing next to Jake, the triage area in the 
	background. Kalandra sees him from across the room - 
	she's standing next to one of the palettes, examining 
	a patient.

					KALANDRA
			Are you Bashir?

	Bashir nods, crosses toward her -- Jake follows, 
	wanting to stay close to him.

					BASHIR
			We got your distress call.

					KALANDRA
			Resource said you were on your
			way.

	Kirby pushes past Jake and Bashir with a medical device 
	in his hand --

					KIRBY
				(on the move)
			Watch it --

	And moves to join the Nurse at a nearby palette, hands 
	her the device.

					KIRBY
			This is the last IP --

					NURSE
				(using the device)
			His pulse is thready, he must be
			bleeding somewhere.

	The patient starts to CONVULSE.

					KIRBY
			We're losing him!

					NURSE
				(to Kalandra)
			Doctor --

8D   ON KALANDRA AND BASHIR

	as she moves to join the Nurse.

					KALANDRA
				(to Bashir)
			Jump right in, standard triage.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE    10A.

8D   CONTINUED:

	Kalandra pushes past Jake to get to the convulsing 
	patient

					KALANDRA
				(to Nurse)
			Give him fifteen mils
			inoprovaline.

8E   ON BASHIR

	examining a wounded patient on the palette in front of him.

					JAKE
				(to Bashir)
			What should I do?

					BASHIR
				(focused on his work)
			Just try to stay out of the way.

	Jake moves off -- we go with him, stretchers flying 
	past -- in the background, Kalandra calls to some 
	orderlies across the room.

					KALANDRA
			Get this man into surgery!

9    ON JAKE

	taking in his surroundings... reacting to the chaos 
	around him...

	He sees a child in a corner, being comforted by her 
	mother.

	The Bolian Orderly and his partner jostle past him, 
	carrying a badly wounded person on a stretcher between 
	them.

					BOLIAN
				(to partner)
			The artery's severed --

10   JAKE'S POV

	as he looks down at the injured victim...

					BOLIAN (O.S.)
			His BP's bottomed out.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE     11.

11   ON JAKE

	as he nearly gags, presses the back of his hand to his 
	mouth... 

	In the background, the Nurse is giving instructions to 
	two orderlies about the patient they're about to cart 
	off.

					NURSE
			Oh-Two, three liters, run full
			saline.

	Jake steps back and his foot slips on something. He 
	looks down to see he's standing in --

12   A PUDDLE OF BLOOD

	He sees that it's coming from a young man slumped 
	against the wall, unconscious. Jake kneels, sees that 
	the wounded man looks ashen, his breathing is shallow, 
	strained.

					JAKE
			Somebody! This man needs help!

	Kalandra turns at the sound of his voice, sees who Jake 
	is referring to.

	A panicked-looking Starfleet ENSIGN limps into the 
	triage area, his foot a bloodied mess...

					ENSIGN
			Help me! Somebody help me!

	Bashir rushes to his side.

					ENSIGN
			I've been hit...

					BASHIR
			Let me have a look.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE    11A.

12   CONTINUED:

					ENSIGN
			Took a disruptor blast, real close --

	The Bolian rushes past --

					BOLIAN
				(on the move)
			Where's that blood plasma!

	The Bolian takes us to --

12A KALANDRA

	kneeling and talking to Jake about the wounded, 
	bleeding man.

					KALANDRA
			There's nothing we can do. He's
			too far gone.

	The look on her face says it all -- she doesn't like 
	letting a man die, but she has no choice... there are 
	too many other wounded to tend to. Kalandra moves 
	away.

	Jake swallows, tries to make sense of this seemingly 
	cold decision. He looks at the dying man's face for a 
	long beat... then moves OFF...

12B   BASHIR

	has helped the Ensign to a seat, is removing his boot.

					BASHIR
			It doesn't look that bad --

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE     12.

12B   CONTINUED:

	Jake enters in the background, starts to watch...

					ENSIGN
				(through the pain) 
			I  was stepping over a Klingon, 
			thought he was dead. Caught me 
			right in the foot.

	As Bashir examines his foot, the Ensign turns to Jake, 
	fear in his eyes.

					ENSIGN 
			You people better get out of here 
			while you still can... the 
			Klingons -- there's no stopping 
			them...

					BASHIR
				(baffled) 
			This is a phaser burn.

					ENSIGN 
			What are you talking about?

	The Ensign's strident tone gives him away -- he shot 
	himself. But as a doctor, it's not Bashir's place to 
	judge.

					BASHIR
				(giving a hypo 
				injection) 
			ust sit tight and we'll get to 
			you as soon as we can.

	Bashir moves off, and the young Ensign turns to Jake, 
	his eyes pleading --

					ENSIGN 
			I took, my phaser... and I... It's 
			not a phaser burn... It was a 
			Klingon...

	Jake doesn't know what to say or do... The young man 
	breaks down, chokes back a sob...

					ENSIGN
				(continuing) 
			You weren't there... you don't 
			know what it was like...

     DEEP SPACE NINE:  "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE       

12B   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ENSIGN 
			The Klingons had us pinned down... 
			we were done for, we all knew it. 
			Hendriks and Pajal got scared and 
			ran -- they ran. Then Sully got 
			hit in the leg and the medics 
			pulled him off the line -- all I 
			could think was I wish I was 
			him... So I...

	He looks down at his mangled foot, loses it...

					ENSIGN
			I took my phaser... and I... Oh,
			God... what'd I do to myself...
			what'd I do... ?

	Jake doesn't know what to feel about the Ensign's 
	anguished admission, he's torn between sympathy and 
	revulsion...

	The Bolian and his partner come in with a patient on a 
	stretcher, approach the wall Jake's squatting near...

					BOLIAN 
			Better find somewhere else to 
			sit...

					JAKE
				(moving off) 
			No problem...

	As they start to unload their patient, Jake moves
	toward the entrance, tucks himself away in a quiet 
	area.

13   ON JAKE

	as he pulls his PADD and stylus out. We can see that 
	his hand shakes a little as he tries to write, 
	everything he's seen has gotten to him. His thoughts 
	come out jumbled, confused.

					JAKE (V.O.)
				(as he writes) 
			Triage... the sorting of the 
			wounded... forces decisions that --

	He stops, tries to get control of himself.

					JAKE (V.O.)
				(putting pen to paper
				again)
			Decisions that test what it means
			to be a doctor.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT ONE     14.

13   CONTINUED:

	Suddenly Kirby's voice from off-screen interrupts 
	Jake...

					KIRBY (O.S.) 
			Hey, you!

	Jake turns to see Kirby trying to get a wounded man 
	onto a stretcher.

					KIRBY 
			Give me a hand.
				(off Jake's hesitation) 
			Come on!

	An uncertain Jake moves to help... as he bends down to 
	pick up the stretcher, the wounded man grabs his collar 
	with a bloodied hand, looks at Jake with imploring 
	eyes... a moment, then he collapses back in pain... off 
	Jake's face as he looks down at his now BLOODIED 
	shirt...

									FADE OUT.

									FADE IN:

14   INT. CAVERN - MAIN WARD

	There are about TWENTY COTS in the room, many of them 
	already occupied with convalescing patients. Some of 
	the cots have MEDICAL EQUIPMENT standing near them, 
	some have IV RACKS holding thermos-like bottles. 
	Nurses and Orderlies move around the room, 
	administering HYPOS, adjusting BANDAGES, checking LIFE-
	SUPPORT EQUIPMENT, etc.

	Three tunnels lead into and out of the main ward -- an 
	ENTRANCE from triage, a back EXIT, and a tunnel leading 
	to another, unseen ward. This last tunnel has a cot or 
	two inside it, and we see Orderlies with stretchers 
	entering and exiting through it. As in the triage 
	area, support beams and power conduits can be seen in 
	the rockface.

	Jake and Kirby ENTER with their patient on a stretcher 
	between them --

					KIRBY
			This way --

	Kirby starts to lead Jake between the cots toward an 
	empty bed. Jake has to struggle to keep up as they 
	wind through the tight spaces between cots. He knocks 
	into an IV RACK standing near a patient's bed, almost 
	tips it over.

					KIRBY
			Watch it!

	Jake steadies the rack with his foot, keeps it from 
	falling.

					KIRBY
				(meaning it)
			Nice move...

	They reach an empty bed near the rock wall, and as they 
	prepare to move the unconscious patient, Kirby speaks 
	to him --

					KIRBY 
				(wry) 
			Here you are, sir, a nice private 
			room with a view. 
				(to Jake) 
			On three... one, two, three --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 8/21/96 - ACT TWO    15A.

14   CONTINUED:

	They lift the patient onto the cot, set him down. 
	Kirby looks up at Jake, smiles.

					KIRBY 
			You can count -- you're hired. 
			Let's get you dressed.

	As Jake follows him away...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     16.

15   INT. CAVERN - TRIAGE AREA

CLOSE ON a stretcher as it flies past, taking us to --

15A THE NURSE

	crouched near an unconscious patient. She sees Kirby 
	and Jake, now in scrubs, ENTER in b.g.

					NURSE
			Over here --

	They head toward the patient she indicated. The Nurse 
	moves off, passing Bashir and Kalandra who're 
	at another patient's side.

					BASHIR 
			I want to try an aortal graft.

					KALANDRA 
			All right, there's an extra 
			surgical table in the back.

	Another Nurse moves past, taking us to --

15B   JAKE AND KIRBY

	as they prepare to get the patient on their 
	stretcher... Jake sees his pale skin and realizes --

					JAKE
				(recoiling)
			He's dead...

					KIRBY
				(nods grimly) 
			Come on... let's get him out of 
			here...

	Jake swallows back his reaction, crouches to help Kirby 
	move the patient...

									DISSOLVE TO:

	A SERIES OF SILENT SCENES

16   INT. CAVERN - MORGUE AREA

	as Jake and Kirby ENTER with the dead man... Jake
	reacts to something off-screen...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    16A.

17   REVEAL

	At least a DOZEN DEAD BODIES laid out on low tables in 
	body bags. An ORDERLY attaches an ID bracelet to a 
	dead person's ankle, then seals the bag.

	Off Jake's face...

									DISSOLVE TO:

18   INT. CAVERN - MAIN WARD

	as Jake and Kirby rush between the beds with an empty 
	stretcher, heading back toward triage. Jake has gotten 
	a little better at this, doesn't have to work so hard 
	to keep up.

	By now, his SCRUBS have gotten BLOODIED from all the 
	patients he's handled.

									DISSOLVE TO:

19   INT. CAVERN - INTENSIVE CARE

	A small alcove with three or four beds and lots of 
	medical equipment. Jake and Kirby move a patient off 
	their stretcher and onto a bed.

19A  INT. CAVERN - A TUNNEL

	as Jake and Kirby hurry down it, a patient on the 
	stretcher between them.

									CUT TO:

20   INT. CAVERN - TRIAGE AREA

	as Jake and Kirby RUSH IN with an empty stretcher, 
	ready to pick up another patient...

	They stop in their tracks when they realize there are 
	no more patients... they've all been taken where they 
	belong.

	Bashir, the Bolian and the Nurse are sitting on the 
	ground, their backs against the wall, exhausted.

	This is a team that's been working together under tough 
	conditions for a long time, and they've developed a 
	kind of gallows humor.

					NURSE
			Party's over...

					KIRBY
				(feigning 
				disappointment) 
			So soon?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     18.

20   CONTINUED:

					BOLIAN 
				(deadpan) 
			And we were just starting to have

					BASHIR 
				(wry) 
			Since you two aren't busy, would 
			you mind carrying me to the 
			nearest replicator so I can get 
			something to eat?

	Off Jake's relief as he realizes he can finally get 
	some rest...

20A  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

20B   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Odo limps in as a curious Sisko watches from behind his 
	desk.

					ODO
			You wanted to see me, Captain?

					SISKO
			I heard you took a little trip to 
			the Infirmary.

					ODO
			I'll be fine.

	He settles into a seat across from Sisko.

					ODO
			The only permanent damage was to 
			my pride.

					SISKO
			What happened?

	Odo sighs, held rather not go into the details, but he 
	knows that he has to answer.

					ODO
			Quark asked me to keep an eye on 
			two Yridians he thought were 
			cheating at dabo. Turned out he 
			was right.
					(MORE)

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    18A.

20B CONTINUED:

					ODO (Cont'd) 
			I could see from the second level 
			that one of them was using a 
			miniature gravimetric scanner to 
			predict where the ball would land 
			on the wheel, then signaling the 
			information to his partner.

					SISKO
			Ingenious.  Go on.

					ODO 
			I started down the stairs to make 
			the arrest and one of them saw me. 
			When they bolted, I... pursued. 
			But in the rush I got a little 
			carried away and I...

					SISKO
			You jumped off the stairs.

					ODO 
			I was planning to change form in 
			mid-air and become a Tarkalean 
			condor.

					SISKO
			That would've been impressive.

					ODO
			I thought so.

	Sisko studies Odo for a beat.

					SISKO 
			It's an understandable mistake. 
			You were a changeling a lot longer 
			than you've been a solid.

					ODO
			Solid... I wonder why my people 
			use that term -- humanoid bodies 
			are so fragile.

	This simple observation strikes a chord with Sisko.

					SISKO
			Yes, they are. And it's a 
			dangerous universe out there.

					ODO
			You're worried about Jake.

	Sisko doesn't deny it.

					ODO
			I'm sure Doctor Bashir is looking 
			out for him.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    18B.

20B CONTINUED:	(2)

	Sisko nods, looks out the window...

					SISKO
			Seems just yesterday he was five
			years old... clinging to me
			because held scraped his knee and
			I was the only one in the world
			who could make it better.

	Sisko smiles at the memory...

					SISKO
			I remember getting up sometimes in 
			the middle of the night and 
			slipping into his room just to 
			make sure he was all right... I'd 
			sit there and watch him sleep... 
			and think to myself that no matter 
			what, I'd never let anything bad 
			happen to this child.

	Sisko shakes his head in wonder...

					SISKO 
			Now he's a sector away, in the 
			middle of a war zone, and there's 
			nothing I can do to protect him.

	Odo does his best to be helpful...

					ODO 
			Try not to worry, Captain. It's 
			not going to do you or Jake any 
			good.

					SISKO
			Can't help it, comes with the 
			territory.

					ODO
			But Jake is eighteen years old. 
				(surely not) 
			Does your father still worry about 
			you?

					SISKO
			All the time.

	Odo takes this in...

					ODO 
			I never realized how stressful it 
			is to be a parent. I have to say, 
			I don't think it's for me.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    18C.

20B   CONTINUED:	(3)

					SISKO 
			That's your choice. 
				(smiles) 
			But you don't know what you're 
			missing.

	A CHIME at the door.

					SISKO 
			Yes.

	The door OPENS and Dax steps in, looking concerned.

					DAX 
			We just got word -- the Klingons 
			destroyed the Farragut near the 
			Lembatta cluster.

					ODO
			What about Ajilon Prime, without 
			reinforcements --

	Sisko interrupts, already on the move --

					SISKO 
			Dax, you're with me. We'll leave 
			as soon as the Defiant's ready.

	Off Odo's face as they leave...

21   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM

	These are all-purpose accommodations for the medical 
	personnel. There are TABLES and CHAIRS in the center 
	of the room, BUNK BEDS against the walls, and a free-
	standing REPLICATOR in a corner.

	Kirby, the Bolian and the Nurse are sitting at one of 
	the tables, SUPERNUMERARIES sit at a second table and 
	Jake, still in his blood-splattered scrubs, is seated 
	at a third, resting his head in his hands. Bashir 
	approaches with two trays of food, sets one down in 
	front of Jake.

					BASHIR 
			Here you go...

					JAKE 
			Thanks.

					BASHIR 
			So how're you holding up?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    18D.

21   CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			Okay.

					BASHIR 
			You handled yourself well today. 
			I'm impressed.

	Embarrassed and not at all sure Bashir's right, Jake 
	picks up his fork, changes the subject.

					JAKE 
			I'm starved.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     19.

21   CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
				(picking up knife and 
				fork)
			Think I'll start with a lateral
			incision across the thigh joint...

	Jake looks down at the food in front of him, drops his 
	fork, his face blanching.

	Bashir realizes Jake's about to get sick, takes him by 
	the arm, and rushes him toward the door... we DROP OFF --

22   ON KIRBY AND THE OTHERS

	as they listen to the off-screen SOUND of Jake puking
	his guts out. Being medical professionals, they're not 
	overly disgusted and continue eating...

					NURSE
			His first day?

					KIRBY
			Yeah.

					BOLIAN
			Pass the salt.

23   INT. CAVERN - TUNNELS - LATER

	as Bashir and Jake ENTER from the tunnel that leads to 
	the surface. Jake, still in his scrubs, seems better 
	now, his stomach is fine.

					BASHIR
			How do you feel?

					JAKE
			Fresh air did me good...

	Jake is thoughtful as they start down the empty
	tunnel...

					JAKE
			You remember that ensign, the one
			who shot himself?

					BASHIR
				(nods)
			How could I forget something like
			that?

					JAKE
			What's going to happen to him?

					BASHIR
			He'll probably be court martialed.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     20.

23   CONTINUED:

	Jake considers for a beat...

					JAKE 
			He said that some of the people in 
			his squad got scared and ran.

					BASHIR
			It happens.

					JAKE 
			But they're Starfleet -- they've 
			passed psych-tests, spent hundreds 
			of hours in battle simulations.

					BASHIR 
			Simulations can't prepare you for 
			the real thing. Nothing can.

	Jake is thoughtful for a beat...

					JAKE 
			Some people say you don't know 
			what you're really made of until 
			you've been in battle...

					BASHIR
				(throwing an arm around 
				Jake's shoulder) 
			Believe me, Jake, there are plenty 
			of situations in life that test a 
			person's character -- thankfully, 
			most of them don't involve death 
			and destruction...

	As they continue around a bend in the tunnel and out 
	of frame...

24   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM

	as Jake and Bashir ENTER, Kirby approaches them. The 
	Bolian and the Nurse have finished eating by now and 
	gone elsewhere.

					KIRBY 
			Doctor Kalandra's looking for you. 
			Something about that aortal graft 
			you did.

					BASHIR 
			Thanks.
				(to Jake) 
			See you later.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    20A.

24A  INT. RECOVERY WARD

	A small chamber similar to Intensive Care, with two or 
	three beds and some medical equipment in it. When 
	Bashir ENTERS, Kalandra is scanning the patient from 
	scene 15A, the one he wanted to do an aortal graft on.

					BASHIR 
			How is he? (or she)

	Kalandra looks up from the unconscious patient.

					KALANDRA 
			The graft's holding -- blood 
			throughput is almost a hundred 
			percent.
				(meaning it) 
			Nice job.

					BASHIR 
			Thanks.
				(returning the
				compliment)
			You've got a good team here. My
			O.R. Nurse was sharp as they
			come.

					KALANDRA
				(smiling) 
			We do the best we can, considering 
			the circumstances.

	She indicates the rockface around them to emphasize her 
	point. But she didn't call Bashir just to pay him a 
	compliment, she wants to ask him something.

					KALANDRA 
			So are things going any better for 
			us? Last I heard Starfleet had 
			pulled out of the Arcanis sector.

					BASHIR 
			The fleet's regrouping to launch 
			a counterattack.

					KALANDRA 
			Do you have any idea what ships 
			are involved? We don't get much 
			news down here, the Klingons have 
			been jamming subspace traffic.

					BASHIR 
			I think the Rutledge and the 
			Tecumseh are heading things up.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    20B.

					KALANDRA 
			The Tecumseh...
				(off Bashir's look) 
			My husband's the science officer.

	Bashir knows the concern she must be feeling.

					BASHIR
				(reassuring) 
			Captain Raymond's one of the best 
			there is... he saw the Tecumseh 
			through the Cardassian wars -- I 
			don't think he's planning to lose 
			her now.

	Kalandra tries to take comfort in this, manages a 
	hopeful smile...

					KALANDRA 
			No, I don't suppose he is.

	The Nurse sticks her head into the room.

					NURSE 
			Doctor, we've prepped that spinal 
			trauma, they're ready for you in 
			surgery.

					KALANDRA 
			I'll be right there.

	The Nurse moves off.

					BASHIR
				(to Kalandra) 
			They're keeping you busy.

					KALANDRA 
			It helps keep my mind off things.

	A look of understanding between them, then she turns 
	and EXITS. Off Bashir's face...

24B   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM

	where Kirby is sitting with Jake as he eats.

					KIRBY 
			Good to see you've got your 
			appetite back.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     21.

24B CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			I've got a pretty strong 
			stomach...
				(apologetic)
			... most of the time.

					KIRBY
				(shrugging it off) 
			Don't worry about it. Same thing 
			happened to me my first day.

	Kirby remembers something --

					KIRBY 
			Know what I heard?
				(off Jake's look) 
			That ship Starfleet sent, the 
			Farragut? The Klingons 
			intercepted it.

					JAKE 
			Starfleet'll send another one, 
			won't they?

					KIRBY 
			It won't get here for days. In 
			the meantime we're looking at a 
			ground war, which is just what the 
			Klingons want. According to a 
			lieutenant I talked to, they've 
			got so many transport scramblers 
			on-line we can't beam troops 
			anywhere.

					JAKE 
			What about using hoppers?

					KIRBY 
			He said the Klingons have been 
			shooting them out of the sky left 
			and right. Unless something 
			changes, he figures the 
			Klingons'll capture the settlement 
			the day after tomorrow.

	Kirby doesn't come off overtly frightened by this. In 
	fact, by telling Jake what he knows, he's venting some 
	of his own anxiety and comes off a bit breathless, 
	almost excited by it all.

					KIRBY 
			Did you see all the bat'leth 
			wounds today?

					JAKE

					JAKE 
			At least we don't have to worry 
			about them in here.

					KIRBY
				(working the Replicator) 
			Don't be so sure. Medical 
			personnel are fair game as far as 
			Klingons are concerned. They'll 
			even kill wounded, right in their 
			beds -- they think they're giving 
			them an honorable death, or 
			something.

	Now that Kirby's managed to transfer all his anxiety to 
	Jake, he's ready to chat... he works the replicator 
	panel... pulls a MUG from the slot.

					KIRBY 
			So... how'd you wind up here?

	Jake is so troubled by all he's heard he finds it hard 
	to focus on an answer...

					JAKE 
			I, uh... I'm writing an article 
			about Doctor Bashir.

					KIRBY 
			You're a journalist?

	Their continuing conversation drops into the background 
	and we hear Jake's V.O. --

		JAKE (V.O.)					JAKE

									DISSOLVE TO:

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO       

25   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM - LATER

	The LIGHTS are dim, everyone is asleep except Jake, 
	who's reclined on one of the bunks, writing. (NOTE: 
	He's no longer in scrubs. The blood that was on his 
	civilian shirt has been cleaned off.) The camera PUSHES 
	slowly toward him as he writes...

					JAKE (V.O.) 
				(continuing) 
			-- He didn't seem that worried, no 
			one else seems to be losing sleep 
			over it, so why's it the only 
			thing I can think about? I've 
			been on the station when it was 
			under attack plenty of times... 
			but somehow the danger never
			seemed as real as it does here.

	We can hear in Jake's voice that he's genuinely rattled 
	by this and doesn't understand why.

					JAKE (V.O.) 
			Maybe it's because I spent all day 
			seeing firsthand what the 
			Klingons are capable of... or 
			maybe it's because for the first 
			time in my life, my father's not 
			here to protect me.

	Suddenly we hear the SOUND of a distant but massive 
	EXPLOSION -- Jake is startled and some of the others 
	jolt awake.

					NURSE 
			What was that?

	The power fails and the LIGHTS go out. A beat later, 
	AMBER EMERGENCY LIGHTS flicker on, accompanied by a 
	warning ALARM.

					BOLIAN 
				(grim) 
			The Klingons -- they must've taken 
			out the reactor...

	Everyone springs out of bed and starts for the door... 
	Jake follows, his dread about what this all portends 
	mounting...

26   INT. CAVERN - MAIN WARD

	as Jake ENTERS behind the others. Bashir is already 
	there with some of the other medical personnel, 
	moving between patients.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    23A.

26   CONTINUED:

	Emergency LIGHTS provide the only illumination, all 
	life-support equipment is off-line, silent.

	Bashir is with a patient hooked to a now useless life-
	support machine -- he gasps, goes into a seizure...

					BASHIR
			He's fibrillating!

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... "- REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     24.

26   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Bashir grabs a HYPO, gives an injection, then uses a 
	cardio-stimulator to begin CPR.

	In the background, the Bolian shouts from another 
	patient's bed --

					BOLIAN 
			Kidney failure, she's going into 
			renal shock --

					BASHIR 
			If we don't get power back soon 
			we'll lose half the ward.

	Kalandra ENTERS, looking grim...

					KALANDRA 
			I just talked to Resource. It's 
			going to be at least three hours 
			before we have power again.

	Everyone reacts to this impossible news

					JAKE 
			There must be some portable 
			generators we could use.

					KALANDRA 
			They're using them to keep the 
			shields up around the settlement.

	A terrible moment as they realize there's nothing they 
	can do...

					BASHIR
				(as it hits him) 
			The runabout... there's a portable 
			generator on the runabout.

					KALANDRA
				(leaping at this) 
			Where is it?

					BASHIR
			About a kilometer south of here.
				(to Jake) 
			I'll need help carrying it.

	Jake is so swept up in the moment he doesn't hesitate 
	to nod that he'll do it...

					KALANDRA 
			You won't be able to beam through 
			the shields, you'll have to take 
			the east tunnel.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     25.

26   CONTINUED:	(3)

					KIRBY
			It lets out beyond the perimeter.
			I'll show you.

	As Jake and Bashir follow Kirby toward the back exit...

27   EXT. PLANET - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY (LOCATION)

	As Jake and Bashir emerge and start off...

27A EXT. PLANETIS SURFACE - DAY (LOCATION) 

	As Jake and Bashir, trotting at a brisk pace, come onto 
	the edge of an open expanse of land, a ridge cresting 
	in the distance.

					BASHIR
			We set down just beyond that
			bridge.

					JAKE
				(agreeing)
			Looks familiar...

	They continue on until suddenly a series of EXPLOSIONS 
	rip into the ground all around them. Bashir 
	immediately dives to the floor, pulling Jake with
	him...

					BASHIR
			Get down!

28   ON JAKE AND BASHIR

	hunkered down on the ground as debris from the 
	continuing EXPLOSIONS rains down on them. 
	detonating ahead of them, behind them, and to both 
	sides.

					BASHIR
			Stay close... keep your head 
			low.

	Jake is so terrified he can barely nod... a beat, then 
	Bashir, his head low, starts for a large rock up ahead. 
	Jake follows close behind...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO    25A.

29   NEW ANGLE - THE ROCK

	as Jake moves in next to Bashir, panting from fear and 
	exertion...

					BASHIR
				(re: explosions) 
			No matter what happens, one of us 
			has got to get that generator.

	Bashir sets off, head low, for the next rock, maybe 
	twenty yards away.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the.. " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT TWO     26.

29   CONTINUED:

	Jake starts after him, but his foot catches the edge of the 
	crater as he sets off and he trips to the ground. 
	By the time he stands, Bashir has already reached the 
	next rock. Bashir looks back, waves him on.

					BASHIR
			Come on!

	As Jake starts toward him an EXPLOSION rips into the 
	ground between them... when the swirl of smoke and 
	debris clears a bit, he can see Bashir urgently 
	him forward.

30   NEW ANGLE - ON BASHIR

	as an EXPLOSION detonates near Jake, obscuring Bashir's 
	view of him...

					BASHIR
			Jake!

31   NEW ANGLE - ON JAKE

	Another EXPLOSION, dangerously close, makes him stagger 
	back... the area ahead of him is being hit by a volley 
	of EXPLOSIONS, forcing him back... the area behind him is 
	relatively unscathed.

	He hesitates, then runs back the way he came...

32   ON JAKE

	his pace intensifying with each step... he's lost it, 
	can think of nothing but getting away from the 
	deafening explosions and the danger they represent... 
	off this moment we...

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT TWO

	FADE IN:
33   EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - DAY (LOCATION)

	as Jake continues his panicked escape... he pushes 
	through brambles and low-hanging branches, panicked and 
	out of breath, totally oblivious to his surroundings.

34   CLOSE - JAKE'S FOOT

	as it catches on a rock...

35   ON JAKE

	as he crashes to the ground... it takes a moment for 
	him to realize that he's landed atop the body of --

36   A DEAD KLINGON

	Horrified, Jake pushes himself away, staggers to his 
	feet, gets his bearings...

37   NEW ANGLE

	as Jake sees TWO DEAD STARFLEET OFFICERS sprawled on 
	the ground nearby, their limbs contorted at unnatural 
	angles, as if their bodies had been tossed there...

38   ON JAKE

	as he backs away, trying to get away from the bodies... 
	he scales a crest in the ground, only to find that he's 
	come upon an even more horrific scene...

39   NEW ANGLE

	The landscape is scattered with dead -- they're mostly 
	Starfleet, with a smattering of Klingons. Jake's 
	effort to escape has only brought him to this scene of 
	carnage, and it seems to him there's no way out of the 
	nightmare...

	He can only do the one thing his brain keeps telling 
	him -- keep moving...

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE    28.

40 ON JAKE

	as his pace intensifies... he has to get out of here, 
	it's all he can think about. He scrambles up a hill in 
	front of him, panting and out of breath, he reaches the 
	top, only to realize too late that the drop on the 
	other side is steeper than he thinks... his momentum 
	carries him forward, and he goes tumbling down the hill 
	into --

41 EXT. A DITCH

	as Jake skids down it and suddenly collides with 
	another body that we barely see... there's a glint of 
	steel, then a RIFLE BUTT swings into view and connects 
	with Jake's head... the impact of the blow sends Jake 
	sprawling into the dirt -- he lies there, stunned and 
	out of breath...

42 NEW ANGLE

	For the first time we see Jake's assailant, a badly 
	wounded Starfleet Lieutenant, his uniform soaked with 
	blood -- he's BURKE, a seasoned combat veteran of 
	about forty.

	He's lying on his side, the phaser rifle nearby, a 
	terrible wound in his abdomen completely debilitating 
	him -- hitting Jake with the rifle has left him lying 
	helpless, unable to move...

	For a moment, all either of them can do is lie there in 
	the dirt and stare at the other man. We see them 
	realize that the other is not the enemy, and they both 
	lie there, fighting for breath. The shelling in the 
	distance has stopped.

					BURKE
				(through the pain)
			Medkit...

	Jake doesn't respond, still too disoriented, still 
	stunned by the blow to his head...

					BURKE 
			Over there...

	He does his best to point toward a MEDKIT lying on the 
	ground a few yards away. When Jake doesn't react, he 
	orders him through clenched teeth --

					BURKE
			Now.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE   29.

42   CONTINUED:

	Something in his voice makes Jake respond, he forces 
	himself up to his knees, shakes his head to clear it, 
	then moves to where the medkit lies on the ground...

					BURKE
			Hypo...

	Jake rummages for it, crawls to Burke with it.

					BURKE
			Sit me up.

	Jake takes him by the shoulder, starts to lift him, but
	a sharp gasp of pain escapes Burke's lips, making Jake 
	stop. He lets go, his hands now bloodied.

					BURKE 
			Do it. I'm not going to die with 
			my face in the dirt.

	Jake takes hold, and ignoring Burke's stifled groans of 
	pain, helps get him into a sitting position, his back 
	against the ditch wall. Burke struggles to catch 
	breath, contain the pain.

					BURKE
				(getting a grip on 
				himself)
			Okay...

	He takes the hypo from Jake, twists a dial, and injects 
	himself. A moment, then the painkiller begins to take 
	effect. His features soften a bit, but it's not 
	enough, he's still in a great deal of pain.

					BURKE 
			How's your head?

					JAKE
				(touching his temple)
			Hurts.

					BURKE 
			You're lucky I didn't kill you - 
			thought you were a Klingon. Have 
			you seen any?

					JAKE
			What?

					BURKE
				(impatient) 
			Klingons -- are there any patrols 
			around?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE   30.

42   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Jake shakes his head.

					BURKE 
			What about Starfleet?

					JAKE 
			No one.

					BURKE 
			Just you and me then.
				(beat) 
			What the hell are you doing out 
			here? Why'd you leave the 
			settlement?

	Jake hesitates, realizing he can't tell the truth...

					JAKE 
			I was outside when the shelling 
			started. I guess I got lost 
			trying to find cover.

					BURKE 
			Lucky me. I could use the 
			company.

	He reaches to his side, pulls out a small WATERPACK, 
	offers it to Jake.

					BURKE 
			Here... water.

					JAKE
				(wanting it) 
			What about you?

					BURKE 
			Go ahead.

	Jake takes the bag, squeezes it into his mouth, gulping 
	it eagerly.

					JAKE 
			Thanks.

					BURKE
				(wry) 
			It probably would've leaked out of 
			me anyway...

	Jake's eyes falls to the terrible wound in Burke's 
	side, and he can't hide his reaction. Burke sees the 
	truth in his eye, and he knows -- he's not going to 
	make it. He grabs Jake by the arm, pulls him close --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE    31.

42   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BURKE 
			Don't let me fall over. I want to 
			go out looking up at the sky, not 
			the ground, all right?

					JAKE 
			Don't worry.

	With that assurance, he pushes Jake away. He lets his 
	head fall back, considers for a beat. Suddenly --

					BURKE
				(with concern) 
			You didn't see a crashed hopper 
			around here, did you?

					JAKE 
			No.

					BURKE
				(smiles) 
			They made it.

					JAKE 
			Who?

					BURKE 
			My platoon. The Klingons had us 
			pinned down. We couldn't beam out 
			because they had a transport 
			scrambler running... so we called 
			for a hopper. As soon as it set 
			down, the Klingons came at us. 
			Our C.O. ordered me and Brice to 
			lay down cover so the squad could 
			get up the ramp.
				(shaking his head as he
				remembers)
			By the time Brice got in, the
			Klingons were practically on top
			of us. The hopper was taking such
			a pounding, I didn't think it
			would make it off the ground.

					JAKE
				(putting it together) 
			You stayed behind on purpose, so 
			they could get away.

	Jake is stunned by this act of simple courage, so 
	starkly opposed to his own act of cowardice... but 
	Burke's mind is on his present predicament. He winces 
	as a shaft of pain shoots into him...

					BURKE 
			The hypo... where is it?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE    12.

42   CONTINUED:	(4)

	Jake reaches for it, realizes there's nothing left in 
	it.

					JAKE 
			It's empty...

	Burke shakes his head at the grim irony.

					BURKE 
			Figures...

					JAKE
				(impulsively)
			I'm going to get you out of here.

	Jake stands, needing to do something, to take action 
	and help this man, as if in doing so, he will somehow 
	redeem himself.

					JAKE
				(looking around) 
			I'll make a stretcher...

					BURKE
				(not buying into it) 
			With what?

	Jake looks around, sees there's nothing.

					JAKE 
			Then I'll carry you.

	Burke can't help but smile at Jake's well-meaning but 
	impossible desire.

					BURKE 
			Kid, you try picking me up, and my 
			guts'll wind up all over your 
			shoes.

	Jake is starting to get frantic as he realizes just how 
	impotent he is...

					JAKE 
			But I've got to do something, I've 
			got to try.

					BURKE 
			Forget it.

	Jake is so bent on convincing himself that redemption 
	is possible that he doesn't consider what he's 
	admitting.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE    33.

42   CONTINUED:	(5)

					JAKE
				(desperate)
			But I have to. That way this'll 
			all make sense. I ran for a 
			reason -- so I could find you and 
			bring you back and save your life.

					BURKE 
			Ran -- ?

					JAKE 
			From the explosions -- we had to 
			get to the runabout, for the 
			generator, but then the shelling 
			started and I couldn't see Doctor 
			Bashir and the explosions kept 
			getting closer and I had to get 
			out of there so I ran, I ran and 
			I kept running until I found you.

					BURKE
			The doctor -- you left him.

	Jake looks, at him, unsure what to say to this.

					JAKE 
			It was a mistake.

					BURKE
			That's what you call it.

					JAKE 
			I didn't mean for it to happen.

					BURKE 
			And now you think that bringing me 
			back is going to make everything 
			all right.

	Jake looks at him, the whole scenario he's constructed 
	in his mind falling apart...

	Burke shakes his head and smiles ruefully... a laugh 
	starts to escape his lips, but it catches, becomes a 
	cough...

					BURKE 
			Sorry, kid.
				(coughing harder)
			Life doesn't work that way.

	His coughing becomes ragged, painful. Burke struggles 
	to catch his breath, but he can't, his lungs are
	filling with fluid --

	He looks at Jake, confusion and panic in his eyes... 
	he's realizing he's dying... his coughs become tortured 
	gasps for breath...

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT THREE   34.

	as he watches in horror... the terrible sounds of 
	Burke's losing struggle for life finally stop...

44 NEW ANGLE

	to include Burke, his lifeless eyes staring up into the

	Jake backs away... finally, he tears his eyes off

	A moment, then Sisko starts to slide out, a HAND TOOL 
	between his teeth.

					DAX 
			What've you been doing in there 
			for three hours?

					SISKO
			Oh, I was just tweaking the

	Dax sees immediately that Sisko is just giving himself

	Sisko knows she's on to him.

			Not really.

					DAX 
			I wish there was something I could

			that everything is going to be

					SISKO
			But you can't. No one can.

					DAX
			I know what it's like to worry 
			about a child. Raifi put Tobin 
			through hell -- and when Neema was 
			six, she came down with Regulan 
			fever. Audrid spent two weeks in 
			the hospital with her, never left 
			her side. It was hundreds of 
			years ago, and I still remember 
			how helpless I felt. I read her 
			all seventeen volumes of Caster's 
			Down the River Light, even though 
			I knew she couldn't hear me. It 
			made me feel like I was doing 
			something, that we were still 
			connected. It wasn't until much 
			later that I realized I was doing 
			it as much for me as for her.

					SISKO
			To keep busy.

					SISKO
			So how did it turn out, with 
			Neema?

					DAX
			She pulled through.

					SISKO
			I was hoping you were going to say 
			that. If that story had an 
			unhappy ending, I never would've 
			forgiven you.

					DAX
			Of course, by the time she was 
			twenty-one, Neema wouldn't even 
			speak to me.

					SISKO
			For how long?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR   35B.

AA45   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX 
			About eight years.

					SISKO
			Do me a favor, tell me about it 
			some other time. Right now, all 
			I care about is seeing Jake again.

					DAX
			You will -- tomorrow, when we get 
			to Ajilon Prime.

	Sisko does his best to take reassurance in this, but 
	the truth is she's worried about Jake too.

					DAX
			You know, Ben... coffee can never 
			be too hot. Are you sure you got 
			the Replicator buffers synchronized?

					SISKO
				(catching on) 
			You want to check for yourself?

					DAX
			I think I will. Can I borrow your 
			decoupler?

					SISKO
			Get your own. I'm going to go 
			check the sonic shower relays.

					DAX
			Good idea.

	And as they exchange a supportive smile, we...

AAA45   EXT. SPACE - AJILON PRIME (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

INT. CAVERN - MAIN WARD

	Though the lights are DIM, the medical equipment is 
	back on-line and the patients are sleeping quietly. 
	Kirby has the night shift... he's moving between the 
	beds, checking on patients.

	Jake ENTERS, and when Kirby looks up from what he's 
	doing and sees him, he couldn't be more surprised.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR   35C.

					KIRBY 
			Jake!

	For once, words fail him.

					KIRBY 
			We thought you were... this is 
			great.

	He takes Jake by the shoulder, smiles, shakes his head 
	in relief. He sees the wound on his forehead --

					KIRBY 
			What happened?

					JAKE 
			I got knocked out when we were 
			trying to get to the runabout. 
			Did Doctor Bashir make it back all 
			right?

	Jake has no idea what the answer will be, so when Kirby 
	nods, his relief is palpable. Kirby inclines his head 
	in the direction of the intensive care ward.

					KIRBY 
			He's in IC for the night, plasma 
			burns on his arm and shoulder. I 
			don't know how he managed it, but 
			he carried the generator back here 
			by himself.

	Jake looks toward the tunnel that leads to IC -- his 
	relief that Bashir's alive is giving way to a mounting 
	sense of anxiety over what Bashir might think of him 
	for running away.

	Kirby looks Jake up and down, shakes his head as if he 
	still can't believe he's really here.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR    36.

					KIRBY 
			We went looking for you when the 
			shelling stopped. There was 
			hardly anything left of the 
			runabout... the whole place was 
			nothing but bomb craters and 
			smoke. We pretty much gave up 
			hope.

	Jake is so distracted by his thoughts of Bashir that he 
	finds himself tossing off a lie, almost distractedly.

					JAKE 
			I must've wandered off in the 
			wrong direction when I came to.

					KIRBY 
			You're lucky you didn't get picked 
			up by the Klingons. Word is, 
			they're massing to attack the 
			compound.

	Kirby sees that Jake is looking toward IC --

					KIRBY 
			You want to see him?

	Jake isn't ready to face him yet...

					JAKE 
			I should probably let him rest.

					KIRBY 
			He's awake, I was just in there.

	Kirby sees Jake's hesitation.

					KIRBY 
			Go ahead, he'll be glad to see 
			you're okay.

	Jake can't see a way out of it, nods... and moves 
	off...

46   INT. CAVERN - INTENSIVE CARE

	Bashir is one of three patients in the unit. He's the 
	only one awake, staring up at the ceiling in the dim 
	light, lost in thought. His arm and shoulder are 
	BANDAGED.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR    37.

	When Jake appears in the entrance, Bashir can't believe

	to react --

					BASHIR 
			Jake... ?

	Bashir's been blaming himself for Jake's death, and the 
	sight of him is such a relief it brings tears to his 
	eyes.

					BASHIR 
			Thank God...

	He covers his face with his hand, doesn't know whether 
	to laugh or cry... when he finally looks up, his 
	expression is strangely pained.

					BASHIR
			I thought you'd been killed. Once 
			the shelling stopped and I 
			couldn't find you, I assumed the 
			worst.

	His eyes are pleading, he needs Jake to understand. 
	Jake finds himself in the odd predicament of having to 
	comfort Bashir. Somehow, the more he has to do it, the 
	worse it makes him feel.

					BASHIR 
			I'm sorry.

					JAKE 
			It's all right.

					BASHIR
			No, it's not. I never should've 
			brought you here in the first place.
				(angry with himself) 
			Now we're stuck here, the Klingons 
			are massing to attack -- what was 
			I thinking!

					JAKE 
			Forget it, okay! What's done is 
			done.

	Jake and Bashir are both a little startled by his 
	vehemence.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR    38.

	After a beat, Bashir smiles, nods his agreement, and we 
	hear Jake in V.O.

					JAKE (V.O.) 
			I couldn't stand hearing him 
			apologize to me like that... not 
			after what I'd done...

	Kirby appears in the door...

					KIRBY 
			All right, you two, visiting hours 
			re over.
				(re: Jake's wound)
			Let me have a look at that.

					JAKE (V.O.) 
			I keep turning it over in my
			head...

	Jake's V.O. carries into

47   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM - NIGHT

	Jake, his head wound now gone, is at one of the tables, 
	writing on his PADD in the DIM LIGHT. Sleeping figures 
	can be seen occupying most of the bunks.

					JAKE (V.O.)
				(continuing) 
			The shelling, losing sight of 
			Bashir, running... and I keep 
			trying to make sense of it all, to
			justify what I did. But when it 
			comes down to it, there's only one 
			explanation. I'm a coward.

	Jake's words, the rhythm of his writing, become 
	angrier.

					JAKE (V.O.) 
			Part of me wishes Bashir had seen 
			me run away and told everyone the 
			truth. They deserve to know what 
			I am... they should know they 
			can't count on me... that if the 
			Klingons attack, I'll run and hide 
			just like I did before...

	Off Jake as he lets his head fall into his hands...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR   38A.

47A  INT. CAVERN - MAIN WARD 

	The place is busy with activity as Nurses and Orderlies 
	move around, tending to patients. Jake wanders in, 
	looking listless. The Nurse moves past with a TRAY of 
	FOOD in her hand, notices him.

					NURSE
				(rushed)
			Jake, take this to the patient in 
			G-four, would you?

	Jake shrugs a yes.

					JAKE 
			Sure. 

	He takes the tray from her and she hurries off.

47B   NEW ANGLE

	as Jake approaches the patient, who's in a bed in the 
	corner, facing away from him.

					JAKE 
			Here you go...

	As Jake comes around he sees the patient's face and 
	realizes it's the Ensign who shot himself in the foot. 
	Jake wasn't expecting to see him and he's a bit taken 
	off guard.

					JAKE 
			One of the nurses asked me to 
			bring you this.

	The Ensign barely acknowledges him, continues staring 
	at the wall. Jake sets the tray down, turns and starts 
	to move off.

					ENSIGN
				(still facing the wall)
			Maybe I'll get a job as a cutter -- 
			could be interesting work.

	Jake stops, unsure if the Ensign was talking to him.

					JAKE 
			What's a cutter?

					ENSIGN 
			You know, on a mining team. 
			They're the guys who split the 
			asteroids up with phasers so the 
			excavators can get at what's 
			inside.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR   38B.

47B CONTINUED:

	The Ensign turns away from the wall to face him.

					ENSIGN 
			You've got to have good aim... and 
			no matter what else you can say 
			about me, you can't say I don't 
			have good aim.

	Jake looks at him, unsure what to say to this odd 
	announcement.

					ENSIGN 
			If I hadn't hit my foot just 
			right, I would've taken my whole 
			leg off.

	Jake doesn't know what to make of the Ensign's ironic 
	perspective. The Ensign smiles ruefully, continues.

					ENSIGN 
			It's funny... one minute your 
			life's moving along just the way 
			you always figured it would, the 
			next... you do something that 
			changes everything, that makes you
			realize you're not who you thought 
			you were.

	He turns to Jake.

					ENSIGN 
			At the Academy, I did really well 
			in the battle simulations - never
			had any problems -- but when 
			you're out there, live shells 
			detonating all around you, it's a 
			whole different thing.

					JAKE
				(more to himself) 
			All you can think about is getting 
			away from the explosions...

	The Ensign looks at him, and Jake realizes his thought 
	escaped his lips.

					ENSIGN 
			Yeah. That's pretty much it.

	The Ensign studies Jake for a moment.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR   38C.

47B   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ENSIGN 
			You know something... you're 
			first person I've talked to since 
			I got here who hasn't made me feel 
			like I'm taking up valuable bed 
			space.

	Jake feels the urge to talk to him, to tell him that he 
	understands why he did what he did -- but he can't 
	bring himself to do it.

					ENSIGN 
			The way everyone looks at me... I 
			can't stand it. After the court 
			martial, I'm going to sign up for 
			the next mining expedition to the 
			Gamma Quadrant.

					JAKE 
			Maybe there won't be a court 
			martial.

					ENSIGN 
			You're right, none of us may get 
			out of here alive.

	Jake is too intent on what he wants to say to be 
	derailed by this; he needs to hold out hope for the 
	Ensign's redemption, thereby making his own redemption 
	at least a possibility.

					JAKE 
			No, I mean -- Starfleet could 
			decide to send you to counseling 
			instead.

					ENSIGN 
			I won't go.

	Jake looks at him, surprised.

					ENSIGN 
			I don't deserve to be in
			Starfleet. Therapy won't change 
			what I did. Nothing can.

	The Ensign turns away, makes a gesture toward his 
	head...

					ENSIGN 
				(quiet) 
			I just wish I'd aimed that phaser 
			a little higher...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR   38D.

47B   CONTINUED:	(3) 

	He falls to staring at the wall again, his features far 
	away. After a long moment, Jake realizes he's 
	forgotten all about him, turns and moves away... off 
	the image of the Ensign, alone...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR    39.

49   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM - DAY

	Jake is now lying on a bunk, his face turned toward the 
	wall. The Bolian is eating at one of the tables. A
	few SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.

	Kirby and the Nurse ENTER in mid-conversation.

					NURSE
			I saw the report on Doctor 
			Kalandra's desk. According to
			Resource, it's only a matter of 
			time before the Klingons reach the 
			compound.

	Jake can't help but overhear this, and it makes his 
	throat go dry. Kirby is rattled by the news too, but 
	rather than show it, he vents his anxiety with a little 
	gallows humor.

					KIRBY 
			I guess that means I have to 
			decide.

					NURSE 
			Decide what?

					KIRBY 
			Whether I'd rather get hacked to 
			bits, or blasted by a disruptor.

					NURSE
				(playing along) 
			Disruptor, no doubt about it -- 
			every molecule in your body 
			vaporized in a flash. No time to 
			feel pain.

	The Bolian looks up from his food.

					BOLIAN 
			Don't be so sure about that. Some 
			people think it's like being 
			boiled alive.

	This is all hitting Jake the wrong way -- far from 
	being amused, it's only stoking his anxiety. He gets 
	up, crosses to the replicator.

					KIRBY 
			Decapitation has its virtues. A 
			clean blow with a nice, sharp 
			bat'leth.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR    40.

49   CONTINUED:

					BOLIAN
				(disagreeing again) 
			Your brain doesn't die for five, 
			ten seconds at least...

	Bashir, no longer in bandages, ENTERS, starts toward 
	the replicator.

					BOLIAN
				(continuing) 
			In theory, your headless corpse 
			could be the last thing you see.

					NURSE 
			You're so negative.

					BOLIAN 
			I'm just telling you what I've 
			heard.

	The three of them are clearly enjoying themselves and 
	making themselves feel better, but Jake is about to 
	lose it. He crosses away from the replicator with a 
	mug of tea, and as he passes, Kirby tries to pull him 
	into the game.

					KIRBY 
			What do you think, Jake?

					JAKE 
			I think it's not funny.

					KIRBY
				(smiling) 
			Of course not.
				(reaching toward Jake to 
				mime the action) 
			There's nothing funny about having 
			your throat slit by --

	Jake shoves Kirby away, hard.

					JAKE 
			Cut it out!

	Everyone is taken aback by his sudden anger --

					JAKE 
			You all think this is some big 
			joke. It's not. People are 
			dying!

					KIRBY 
			I was just kidding.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR    41.

49   CONTINUED:	(2)

					JAKE 
			It's all so stupid. This whole

			ten years, no one's going to 
			remember what anyone did here.

					BASHIR
			Jake --

					JAKE 
			Maybe you saved a hopper full of 
			people, maybe you shot yourself in 
			the foot -- no one's going to
			remember.

	Jake slams his mug down on a table, hard.

					BASHIR
			Jake.

	Bashir's tone brings Jake rant to a stop --

					BASHIR
			Come on. Let's take a walk.

	Bashir heads for the door... after a beat, a chastened
	Jake follows...

50   INT. CAVERN - A TUNNEL

	as Bashir turns to face Jake.

					JAKE
			I'm sorry.

	Jake tries to contain the tears he feels welling up 
	inside him...

					BASHIR 
			Look, I know you're scared -- we 
			all are.

					JAKE
				(jumbled) 
			No... yes, it's not that -- I...

	He can't come out with it, shakes his head, looks away.

					BASHIR
			What, Jake -- what is it?

	Jake feels the urge to confess pressing at him... but 
	he can't, it's too humiliating, and he squelches it.

 DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Nor the... " - REV. 08/21/96 - ACT FOUR 42-43.    

50   CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			I just didn't think what they were

					BASHIR 
				(no dice) 
			Come on. That's not what set you 
			off. Something's eating at you,
			I can see it.

					JAKE 
			I don't know what you're talking 
			about.

					BASHIR 
			Ever since you came back you've 
			been walking around here looking 
			miserable.

					JAKE 
			Leave me alone.

					BASHIR 
			Jake --

					JAKE 
			Leave me alone!

					BASHIR 
			All right. If that's what you 
			want. But you know where to find 
			me if you want to talk...

	And with that, Bashir moves off, EXITS. Jake waits for 
	him to leave, then leans back against the tunnel wall. 
	He slides down to a sitting position, tries to 
	back the sobs welling up inside him. But it's 
	impossible, and when they come, they come full force --
	his body is wracked with them... hold on this image for 
	a few beats, then...

AA53   AN EXPLOSION (FORMERLY SC. 52)

	rocks the area, jolting Jake awake. A beat, then 
	another EXPLOSION confirms it -- the settlement is 
	under attack!

	Jake staggers to his feet, moves off...

53   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM

	where Kalandra is trying to give instructions to her 
	worried staff as Jake ENTERS -- Bashir, Kirby, the 
	Nurse, the Bolian, and some N.D. medical personnel are 
	there.

	The room SHUDDERS from another EXPLOSION, dust rains 
	down and the LIGHTS start to FLICKER on and off --

54   ON JAKE

	as he struggles to fight back the onset of panic --

		KIRBY						NURSE
	Are they inside				What's going on?
	the compound?

		KALANDRA					BOLIAN
	Everyone listen.			What are we going to do?

					KALANDRA
				(when they fall silent) 
			We're evacuating.

	Worried murmurs from the group... another explosion
	rattles the room...

					KALANDRA 
			We're going to take the patients 
			out the north tunnel to the 
			surface. A hopper is going to 
			take us down the peninsula to the

					BASHIR 
			We have to stay calm. Focus on 
			your job. Those people in there

					KALANDRA 
			Let's move.

	Galvanized by her words, the group breaks up, heads 
	out... Jake makes to follow, but once the last of them 
	is out the door he drops back, leans against the wall, 
	struggles to steady his uneven breathing... an 
	explosion triggers another cascade of dust.

	Jake stands there in the FLICKERING LIGHTS, unable to 
	move, paralyzed with dread...

INT. CAVERN - MAIN WARD

	The evacuation in progress. Nurses and orderlies are 
	getting patients onto stretchers and taking them out a 
	BACK EXIT. Their urgent shouts, the FLICKERING LIGHTS, 
	the EXPLOSIONS -- it all adds up to a scene of utter 
	Pandemonium.

58   TWO STARFLEET GUARDS

	armed with phaser RIFLES have taken up position near 
	the entrance -- one is male, one female.

59   KALANDRA

	is standing near the back exit, motioning to some 
	patients able to walk on their own.

	patient on a stretcher.

					BOLIAN
			Give me a hand --

61   BASHIR AND KIRBY

	ENTER from the back exit with an empty stretcher just 
	as an EXPLOSION shatters the air. Kirby looks over at 
	the two guards, dismayed that so few have been sent to 
	protect the hospital.

					KIRBY
			Is that it -- two guards?

					BASHIR
			The rest must be out defending the
			perimeter.

	The male guard, after conferring with his colleague, 
	moves into the tunnel.

					KIRBY
			Great, one's leaving.

62   THE NURSE

	is holding the hands of two convalescing children, 
	helping them shuffle toward the back...

					NURSE
			We're going someplace safe, all
			right?

63   INT. CAVERN - STAFF BUNK ROOM

	as Jake hides under one of the tables, lost in his 
	fear. An EXPLOSION rocks the room, shaking a GIRDER 
	loose from the ceiling. It smashes the table next to 
	Jake's and crushes it instantly...

	This snaps him out of it -- he realizes it's not safe 
	here, scurries for the door...

	Jake rounds a bend and runs smack into the male Guard, 
	who's rushing back toward the main ward --

					MALE GUARD
			They're coming!

	He shoves Jake down the corridor.

					MALE GUARD
			Move.

	The Guard looks back the way he came, his phaser rifle 
	at ready. We hear the ominous sound of heavy FOOTSTEPS 
	coming down the corridor toward them...

65   NEW ANGLE - JAKE

	as he starts down the tunnel, in the background, we can 
	see the main ward. The last three patients are being 
	carried out the back exit on stretchers. Two of them 
	are being carried by N.D. medical personnel, the third 
	by Kirby and the Bolian. The female guard is standing 
	at the back exit, waving them on.

					FEMALE GUARD
			Come on, let's go!

66   INT. CAVERN - TUNNEL/MAIN WARD (OPTICAL)

	as Jake nears the mouth of the tunnel Kirby looks up 
	and sees him --

					KIRBY
			Anyone left back there?

				(on the move)
			No --

	Suddenly the Guard gets SHOT in the back by a disruptor 
	BLAST -- as he falls forward, his phaser rifle flies 
	from his grasp and clatters to the floor in the center 
	of the ward.

	Sisko finishes, looks up at his son... a moment as they 
	regard each other...

					JAKE
				(quiet)
			So what do you think... ?

					SISKO 
			Anyone who's been in battle would 
			recognize himself in this... but 
			most of us wouldn't care to admit 
			it.

	He studies Jake's features, wants him to understand.

					SISKO 
			It takes courage to look inside 
			yourself... and even more courage 
			to write about it for other people
			to see.

	Jake takes in his father's words, and maybe even takes 
	some comfort in them...

	Sisko can see Jake is still raw from the whole 
	experience, that he needs to be comforted... he pulls 
	him into his arms, holds him close.

					SISKO
			I'm proud of you, son...

	As Sisko holds Jake tight, we...

									FADE OUT.
