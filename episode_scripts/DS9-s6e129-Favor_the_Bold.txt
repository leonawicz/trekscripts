	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	CLOSE ON the Defiant adrift, helpless, its engines 
	leaking plasma.

2    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	DAX is in the Captain's chair. O'BRIEN, BASHIR and 
	NOG are at their stations. Everyone is tense and 
	focused; they're in a precarious situation and they 
	know that the slightest miscalculation could mean their 
	lives.  (Note: We are at Red Alert.)

					DAX 
			Cadet.

					NOG 
			Continuing to emit distress 
			signals on all frequencies, sir.

					DAX
			Chief.

					O'BRIEN 
			We're still venting plasma. Any 
			ship passing within a hundred 
			million kilometers will know we're 
			here --
				(concerned)
			-- and that we're not going 
			anywhere.

	Dax ponders their situation.

					BASHIR
			In other words, we're sitting 
			ducks.

					O'BRIEN 
			Looks that way.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - TEASER       2.

2    CONTINUED:

					NOG
				(off his console) 
			We have company, Captain. Two 
			Dominion ships heading this way, 
			bearing one-nine-seven mark one-
			three-five.

					O'BRIEN
				(a warning) 
			They'll have us in weapons range 
			in twenty-two seconds.

					DAX
			Shields?

					NOG 
			Shields at thirty percent.

					DAX
			Phaser banks?

					O'BRIEN 
			The entire weapons array is 
			off-line.

					BASHIR 
			What do we do now, captain?

					DAX
				(grim) 
			Now we find something to hold onto.

	And as the crew braces themselves for an attack --

									CUT TO:

3    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	Two Dominion ships strafe the vulnerable Defiant.

4    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	as the ship SHAKES under repeated HITS.

					NOG 
			Shields are down to twenty percent.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - TEASER       3.

4    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			I don't know how much more of this 
			we can take.

					DAX 
			Steady, people. 

	And as the ship SHAKES again --

5    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	A Klingon Bird of Prey DECLOAKS right behind one of the 
	Dominion ships and FIRES, blasting it to pieces.

6    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	as everyone kicks into action --

					O'BRIEN
			Now?

					DAX
			Now.
				(barking orders)
			Shields up. Engines at full
			impulse. Power to main phasers.

					O'BRIEN
			Target locked.

					DAX
			Fire.

7    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	to see that the Defiant, which was playing possum, 
	swing under the other Dominion ship and unload a 
	barrage of phaser FIRE, OBLITERATING it.

8    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	as the crew reacts to their victory.

					DAX
			Cadet, any more Dominion ships out
			there?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - TEASER       4.

8    CONTINUED:

					NOG
				(off his console) 
			None that I can see.

					DAX
				(to the com) 
			This is the captain speaking. All 
			hands, stand down. Good job, 
			people.

					NOG 
			We're being hailed by the 
			Rotarran. Commander Worf would 
			like to speak to you.

					DAX
			Onscreen.

9    ANGLE ON THE SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as the image of WORF appears.

					DAX
				(with a smile) 
			My hero.

					WORF
			Well done, captain. You were a 
			very effective decoy.

					DAX 
			How about next time we switch 
			roles? That way, I can rescue you.

					O'BRIEN
				(off his console) 
			You may have to wait awhile, 
			captain. We've just received 
			orders from Starfleet Command. 
			All ships in this sector are to 
			fall back to Starbase Three-Seven-
			Five.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - TEASER       5.

 9   CONTINUED:

					DAX 
			Fall back again?

	Any sense of victory the Defiant crew might have felt 
	at destroying the two Jem'Hadar ships is rapidly fading 
	away.

					O'BRIEN
				(an old refrain) 
			Engage and retreat. Engage and 
			retreat. I'm telling you, that's 
			become our favorite tune.

					BASHIR
			Well, we'd better learn a new one 
			or the next song we'll be singing 
			is "Hail the Conquering Dominion."

					DAX
				(determined) 
			I wouldn't start learning those 
			lyrics just yet, Doctor.
				(to the viewscreen) 
			Worf, we'll see you at Starbase 
			Three-Seven-Five.

					WORF 
			I'll be waiting.

	The image of Worf on the viewscreen disappears. Dax 
	quickly taps her command console.

					DAX
				(snapping an order to
				helm)
			Set a course for these
			coordinates. Warp seven.

10   OMITTED

11   INT. STARBASE 375 - SISKO'S OFFICE

	as an angry Dax confronts SISKO.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - TEASER       6.

11   CONTINUED:

					DAX 
			I don't know what all you brass 
			hats in Starfleet Command are 
			thinking, but take it from a 
			simple field officer, we're not 
			going to win this war by running 
			away from the enemy.

	Sisko chooses to remain silent, allowing Dax to 
	continue to vent.

					DAX 
			Benjamin -- troop morale is at an 
			all-time low. Even the Klingons 
			are starting to wonder if we can 
			defeat the Dominion. We need a 
			victory -- a big victory. And we 
			need it soon!

					SISKO
			I couldn't agree with you more.

					DAX
				(pounding her fist on 
				his desk) 
			Then do something about it.

					SISKO
			I have.

	This catches Dax somewhat flat-footed; she looks at 
	Sisko expectantly.

					SISKO 
			In fact, I'm presenting a plan 
			to Starfleet Command at oh-eight-
			hundred, tomorrow.

					DAX 
			What plan?

12   ANGLE ON SISKO

	as he taps a panel and a graphic of Deep Space Nine 
	surrounded by "attacking" Federation forces appears on 
	the wall monitor.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - TEASER       7.

12   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			We're going to retake Deep Space 
			Nine.

	Dax breaks into a smile -- this is what she was hoping 
	to hear, and we:

									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

13   EXT. SPACE - STARBASE 375 (OPTICAL)

	Establishing. The Defiant and Rotarran are in orbit
	around Starbase 375.

14   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL 

	GARAK is seated at a table as Doctor Bashir scans Garak's 
	head with a medical tricorder. Worf, Dax and O'Brien watch.

					BASHIR 
			Everything seems to be perfectly normal. 
				(a beat)
			I'm sorry, Garak.

					GARAK
			Keep looking, Doctor. I'm sure 
			whatever Starfleet put in there 
			is very well hidden.


					O'BRIEN
			Ridiculous.

					GARAK
			That's easy for you to say, Chief. 
			You don't know them as well as I 
			do. They're desperate people.

					DAX
			Garak, you're not going to get any 
			of us to believe that Starfleet 
			Intelligence has implanted some 
			kind of neural transponder in your 
			brain to monitor your thoughts.

					GARAK
			I would've if I were them. In 
			fact, when I was conducting 
			interrogations for the Obsidian 
			Order, I did a lot worse.

					BASHIR

			I'm sure you did.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE      9.

14   CONTINUED:

	Bashir closes his medical tricorder and gets up from 
	the table.

					WORF
			They're not interrogating you, 
			Mister Garak, they're debriefing 
			you. There is a difference.

					GARAK
			Not from where I'm sitting.

	Bashir steps over to the replicator.

					BASHIR 
			Tarkalean tea.

					DAX
			I'll take a raktajino, Julian.

					BASHIR
				(to replicator) 
			And a raktajino.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, Garak -- we're at war with 
			the Dominion. Cardassia is part 
			of the Dominion. You're a 
			Cardassian. And at one time, a 
			fairly important one. Of course 
			Starfleet Intelligence is going 
			to press you for specifics -- they 
			need to know everything you know.

	Bashir returns and sits down with the drinks.

					WORF
			The smallest detail could prove 
			extremely important.

					GARAK
			Well take it from me, it's a lot 
			more fun asking questions than 
			answering them. All things 
			considered, I'd prefer being on 
			the Defiant with all of you.

					O'BRIEN
			Believe me, you haven't been 
			missing much.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     10.


14   CONTINUED: (2)

					DAX 
			Hopefully, that's about to change.

					BASHIR
			You think Starfleet Command will 
			approve Sisko's plan?

					DAX
			We'll find out soon enough. He's 
			presenting it now.

	O'Brien lifts his glass to Bashir.

					O'BRIEN
			Here's to retaking the castle.

	Bashir lifts his glass, they CLINK.

					BASHIR 
			And planting our flag on its 
			battlements, once again.

	They drink.

					DAX
			You two spent too much time in the
			holosuites...

	And as they all sip their drinks --

									CUT TO:

15   INT. STARBASE 375 - SISKO'S OFFICE

	Sisko, ADMIRAL ROSS, ADMIRAL COBURN, a human in his 
	late fifties, and a Vulcan, ADMIRAL SITAK, are gathered 
	around the wall monitor which displays Sisko's plans 
	for the retaking of Deep Space Nine.

					SISKO 
			By putting together a task force 
			comprised of elements from the 
			Second, Fifth and Ninth fleets, 
			I believe that we can take back
			Deep Space Nine -- the most 
			important piece of real estate in 
			the quadrant.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     11.

15   CONTINUED:

					ADMIRAL SITAK 
			Your plan, Captain Sisko, is not 
			without merit. However, I remain 
			skeptical.
				(considering) 
			The Dominion will undoubtedly send 
			a large fleet to stop you.

					SISKO
			Which will divert their forces and 
			slow their advance into Federation 
			territory.

					ROSS 
			As well as leave their flank 
			vulnerable.

					SISKO
			Giving us a chance to go on the 
			offensive, for a change.

					ADMIRAL COBURN 
			There's one thing that still 
			concerns me...

					SISKO
			What's that, Admiral?

					ADMIRAL COBURN 
			Earth. You've left it a very 
			tempting target.

					ROSS
			Earth would still be defended by 
			the Third Fleet.

					ADMIRAL COBURN
			But what if you're wrong and the 
			Dominion doesn't commit its forces 
			to protect Deep Space Nine? What 
			if they launch a full-scale 
			assault on Earth instead?

	A moment as they consider this possibility.

					ADMIRAL COBURN 
			If we do what you're 
			proposing, we'll never get 
			reinforcements there in time.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     12.

15   CONTINUED: (2)

					SISKO 
			The Dominion won't attack Earth.

					ADMIRAL SITAK
			How can you be sure?

					SISKO
			Because Earth isn't the key to the 
			Alpha Quadrant. The wormhole is. 
			And whoever controls Deep Space 
			Nine controls the wormhole.

	And off this moment of decision --

16   EXT. SPACE - TEROK NOR (OPTICAL)

	Establishing.

17   INT. QUARK'S

	The, by now, "normal" clientele: BAJORAN, CARDASSIAN, 
	and some JEM'HADAR. QUARK stands behind the bar 
	reading a PADD across from MORN, seated on his stool, 
	waiting expectantly.

					QUARK
			Unbelievable.
				(reads a little more) 
			Amazing.
				(reading a little more) 
			What nerve.

	Quark looks up from the PADD, shaking his head.

					QUARK
			Morn -- you do have a problem.

	Morn gives a melancholic nod.

					QUARK 
			But lucky for you, the solution 
			is simple. You're a grown man. 
			If you don't want to attend your 
			mother's birthday party, you don't 
			have to.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     13.

17   CONTINUED:

					QUARK (Cont'd)
			And if she keeps whining about it,
			just remind her there's a war on 
			and you have things to do.
				(checking Morn's glass) 
			Another ale?

	Morn nods. But before Quark can draw it for him, he 
	spots something off screen --

17A  QUARK'S POV

	of MAJOR KIRA walking past his establishment.

17B  ON QUARK

	as he stops what he's doing and starts to hurry out, 
	putting the still empty glass in front of Morn.

					QUARK
			Here. It's on the house.

	Morn looks puzzled and disappointed at the empty glass 
	as Quark EXITS onto the Promenade.

18   INT. PROMENADE - LOWER LEVEL

	Quark catches up to Kira.

					QUARK 
			Major, you ready?

					KIRA
				(not thrilled at the 
				prospect) 
			Now?

					QUARK 
			Right now.

	After a beat of consideration, Kira nods.

					KIRA 
			All right, but I don't think it'll 
			do any good.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     14.

19   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	Kira and Quark walk briskly down the hallway.

					QUARK 
			I keep telling myself that Odo 
			never meant for Rom to get 
			arrested... that it was all a 
			mistake. Bad timing. Bad luck.

					KIRA
			That's what I thought, too -- at 
			first.

					QUARK
			I've known Odo a long time... 
			he's not a collaborator.

					KIRA
			Then why's your brother still in 
			a holding cell?

	A good question to which he doesn't have an answer. 
	They continue walking, disappearing around a corner.

20   INT. ANOTHER HABITAT RING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	Kira and Quark approach a JEM'HADAR SOLDIER and BAJORAN 
	SECURITY OFFICER, standing guard at the entrance of 
	Odo's Quarters.


					QUARK 
			We're here to see Odo.

					JEM'HADAR SOLDIER
			The Founders are not to be 
			disturbed.

					QUARK
			Odo will make an exception for us.

					JEM'HADAR SOLDIER
			There are no exceptions.

					KIRA
			I'd like to hear that from Odo.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     15.

20   CONTINUED:

					BAJORAN OFFICER 
			I'm sorry, major, but you're 
			wasting your time.
				(off her look) 
			His orders were quite clear. He 
			doesn't want to see anyone. Not 
			until his guest leaves.

					KIRA
			And how long has his "guest" been 
			visiting?

					BAJORAN OFFICER 
			As far as I know, the female 
			changeling hasn't left his 
			quarters for three days.

	But Quark starts towards the door, not quite ready to 
	give up.

					JEM'HADAR SOLDIER 
			Step away from the door, Ferengi.

					KIRA
			Hey, hey...

					BAJORAN OFFICER 
			Perhaps it would be best if you left.
				(re: the Jem'Hadar soldier) 
			My... colleague over here takes 
			his duties very seriously.
				(to Kira, conciliatory) 
			I promise to tell Odo you were here.

					KIRA
			Let's go, Quark.

	Kira takes Quark by the arm and guides him away. WE 
	HOLD ON the door for a beat --

21   INT. ODO'S BEDROOM

	CLOSE ON ODO, seated on a rumpled bed. The FEMALE 
	SHAPE-SHIFTER, standing by the window, turns to face him. 
	The Female Shape-shifter scrutinizes Odo as they speak.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			So that is how Solids experience 
			intimacy.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     16.

21   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			Not all Solids. Humans,
			Bajorans...

	The Female Shape-shifter nods; she takes all this 
	information very seriously.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			I really must thank you, Odo.

					ODO
			For what?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			For giving me a new insight into 
			the Solids.

					ODO
			And what have you learned?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			That what they consider intimacy 
			is only a shadow of what we 
			experience in the Great Link. 
				(off Odo's silence) 
			You don't agree?

					ODO
			I didn't say that.

	The Female Shape-shifter decides not to push it.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			You've done this before.

					ODO
			Not often.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			But when you have, you enjoyed it.

					ODO
			Yes.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			And you regret not having 
			experienced it with Major Kira.

	The conversation has taken an uncomfortable turn for 
	Odo.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     17.

21   CONTINUED: (2)

					ODO 
			I'd rather not discuss Major Kira.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I don't see why not. When we 
			link, your feelings for her are 
			made very clear.

					ODO
			Then why do you insist we "talk" 
			about it?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Because talking is still important 
			to you. But I promise you, one 
			day it won't be. One day, the 
			Link will be all you need.
				(a beat) 
			And that day is coming soon.

					ODO
				(surprised) 
			Is it?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(nodding) 
			It's amazing you've survived this 
			long without it. 
			It's only now, after I've been 
			away from the Great Link myself, 
			that I understand how painful it 
			must have been for you.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT ONE     18.

21   CONTINUED: (3)

					ODO 
			It hasn't always been easy.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(smiling) 
			Well, you never have to be alone 
			again.

	That thought hangs in the air for a beat.

					ODO 
			I should be going. There's a 
			meeting of the station's Ruling 
			Council. Dukat and Weyoun are 
			expecting me.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			That meeting was held three days 
			ago.

					ODO
			Three days? How could I have lost 
			track of that much time?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Does that bother you?

					ODO
				(thinking it over)
			Yes, it does...

	Odo looks at the Female Shape-shifter, hoping she will 
	provide a clarity to resolve his confusion.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Don't let it. You've been living 
			with the Solids' concept of time 
			for too long. Let them worry 
			about meetings, schedules, 
			obligations...
				(dismissive)
			... none of that has anything to 
			do with you. You're a changeling. 
			You're timeless.

	Odo doesn't disagree. She takes hold of his hand and 
	cups it in hers.

ACT TWO

	FADE IN:

	Re-establishing.

24   INT. WARDROOM

	WEYOUN is leaning against the table, closely studying 
	one of Ziyal's minimalist, ink brush paintings. It 
	seems to puzzle him.

	The door OPENS, Kira ENTERS.

					WEYOUN
			(without looking up)
			You asked to see me, major?

					KIRA
			That's right.

	But before she can explain what she wants, Weyoun holds 
	the painting up for her to see.

					WEYOUN
			First, tell me something. What
			do you think of this?

					KIRA
			It's one of Ziyal's paintings.

					WEYOUN
			I know who the artist is. Her
			father gave it to me. He claims
			that it won some sort of prize on
			Cardassia.

					KIRA
				(poker-faced)
			Gul Dukat must be very proud.

					WEYOUN
			I suppose.
				(sincere)
			Is it any good?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     21.

24   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			I think so. Why -- don't you?

					WEYOUN 
			I don't know how to judge it. You 
			see, my people lack a sense of aesthetics.

					KIRA
				(could care less) 
			That's too bad.

					WEYOUN
			I sometimes think so as well. But 
			if aesthetics were truly 
			important, the Founders would've 
			included it in our genetic makeup.

					KIRA
			Or they made a mistake.

					WEYOUN
			Gods don't make mistakes.
				(musing) 
			Though sometimes I think it would 
			be nice to be able to carry a 
			tune.
				(snapping out of it) 
			So, what can I do for you, Major?

					KIRA
			It's about Rom.

					WEYOUN
			Ah, yes, the Ferengi saboteur.

					KIRA
			He's been in a holding cell for 
			over a week.

					WEYOUN
			Has it really been that long?

					KIRA
			I was hoping you would consider 
			releasing him.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     22.

24   CONTINUED: (2)

					WEYOUN 
			Impossible. You can't release a 
			man and then execute him. It 
			makes no sense.

					KIRA
			Execute Rom?

					WEYOUN
			He committed an act of terrorism 
			against the Dominion. Not only 
			did he try to interfere with our 
			efforts to bring down the 
			minefield, but as I understand it, 
			he was also the diabolical genius 
			who came up with the idea of 
			self-replicating mines in the 
			first place. I'm afraid there's 
			no getting around it, Major. He 
			must be made an example so that 
			others think twice before they act 
			against us.

					KIRA
			Rom's married to a Bajoran 
			citizen...

					WEYOUN
			I'm well aware of that. And I'm 
			willing to believe -- for now -- 
			that his wife isn't a 
			co-conspirator. Otherwise, treaty 
			or no treaty, she would share his 
			fate. I'm sorry, major, but the
			Dominion takes a dim view of 
			terrorism.
				(with finality) 
			Your friend must pay the price for 
			his crime.

					KIRA 
			We'll see what the Bajoran 
			government says about that.

					WEYOUN
			I'm afraid their pleas will fall 
			on deaf ears.

	Kira heads for the door. Weyoun stops her --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO    22A.

24   CONTINUED: (3)

					WEYOUN 
			Major.

	Kira turns to see Weyoun holding up the painting.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     23.

24   CONTINUED: (4)

					WEYOUN 
			Would this be more aesthetically
			pleasing if it were blue?

	Kira stares coldly for a moment, then EXITS. We hold 
	on Weyoun for a beat to see him shrug slightly, then 
	stare back at the painting.

25   INT. HOLDING CELL

	CLOSE ON ROM, seated on a bench, looking faintly 
	worried.

					ROM
				(a statement) 
			I'm going to die.

26   WIDER

	to include Quark and LEETA, standing outside the 
	holding cell. Leeta is fighting back tears. A 
	Jem'Hadar guard is present, but some distance away.

					LEETA 
			Stop saying that.

					ROM 
			I didn't say it --
				(pointing to Quark) 
			-- he did.

					QUARK 
			What I said is that they're 
			planning to execute you -- 
			it's not the same thing.

					ROM 
			It is to me.

					LEETA 
			Rom -- we are not going to let 
			them hurt you. Kira has gone to 
			the Bajoran Council of Ministers. 
			She's asking them to lodge an 
			official protest.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     24.

26   CONTINUED:

					ROM
				(sincere) 
			That's sweet.
				(then grimmer) 
			But I doubt it'll do any good.

					QUARK

			And I've talked to Grand Nagus Zek 
			himself and he's offered to buy 
			your freedom from the Dominion.

					ROM 
			I don't think Weyoun cares much 
			for latinum.
				(a beat) 
			I'm a dead man.

	Leeta breaks down CRYING.

					QUARK 
			Would you please stop upsetting 
			Leeta?

					ROM 
			Sorry.

					QUARK
			Besides, you think your big 
			brother is going to let anything 
			happen to you?

					ROM 
			What can you do?

					QUARK. 
			I'm not sure. But I'll think of 
			something. No matter what it 
			takes... no matter what I have to 
			do... I'm going to get you out of 
			here.

					LEETA 
			Oh, Quark -- you do that and I'll 
			work your dabo tables for free.

					QUARK
			For how long?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     25.

26   CONTINUED: (2)

					LEETA 
			An entire year.

					QUARK
			Make it two.

					ROM 
			Brother!

					QUARK
				(indignant) 
			Isn't your life worth two years? 
			Now sit tight and trust your older 
			brother.

					ROM 
			But I don't want you to try to 
			save me.

	Leeta is shocked to hear Rom say such a thing.

					LEETA 
			What are you talking about?
				(to Quark) 
			They must've done something to his 
			mind.

					QUARK
			What mind?

					ROM 
			I'm serious. Brother, you have 
			more important things to worry 
			about.

					QUARK
				(misunderstanding) 
			The bar's doing fine. But thanks 
			for caring.

					ROM 
			I'm not talking about the bar.


					LEETA 
			Rom -- what could be more 
			important than your life?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     26.

26   CONTINUED: (3)

					ROM 
			Destroying the anti-graviton beam 
			to prevent the Dominion from 
			taking down the minefield.
				(to Quark) 
			You've got to finish what I 
			started. The fate of the entire 
			Alpha Quadrant rests in your 
			hands. Billions and billions of 
			people are counting on you.

					QUARK
				(holding his head) 
			Boy, are they going to be 
			disappointed.

	Rom stands up.

					ROM 
			Brother, you can do this. You 
			have to do this. You will 
			do this.

					QUARK
			What happens if I get caught?

					ROM 
			Then we'll die together. Side-by-
			side, heads held high -- knowing 
			we did our best.


	Rom stands there, holding his head high, caught up in 
	his own vision of noble self-sacrifice. So is Leeta.

					LEETA
				(my hero) 
			Oh, Rom...

					QUARK
			But I don't want to die...

					ROM
				(still a man with a 
				mission) 
			If that's what's written, then 
			that's what's written. Now get 
			going, brother. You have a lot 
			of work to do.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     27.

26   CONTINUED: (4)

 	Quark nods... who's he to argue with such 
	determination? Rom smiles and turns to Leeta:

					ROM 
			So, tell me, Leeta... what else 
			is new? Have they fixed the sonic 
			shower in our quarters yet?

27   INT. REPLIMAT

	ZIYAL is seated at a table, sketching on an artist's 
	pad with real ink and paper. Kira approaches.

					KIRA 
			Ziyal.

	Ziyal looks up from her drawing.

					ZIYAL 
			Nerys -- I haven't seen you in 
			weeks.

					KIRA
			Do you have a minute?

					ZIYAL 
			Sit down.

	Kira does.

					KIRA 
			I need you to talk to your father 
			for me.

					ZIYAL
				(surprised) 
			About what?

					KIRA 
			Rom.

	And off Ziyal's questioning look

28   INT. OPS

	Ziyal gets off the turbolift, looks around and heads 
	for Dukat's office.

29   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	as it OPENS and Ziyal ENTERS, a hopeful, expectant look 
	on her face. She steps up to Dukat and kisses him on 
	the cheek.

					ZIYAL 
			Father, I need to talk to you.

					DUKAT 
			Is something wrong, my dear?

					ZIYAL 
			Nothing that you can't fix.

					DUKAT
				(pleased he can help his 
				daughter) 
			Name it.

	Ziyal smiles, pleased to hear her father's attitude.

					ZIYAL 
			I want you to free Rom.

					DUKAT 
			You're joking.

	That's the first hint to Ziyal that this may not turn 
	out the way she thought.

					ZIYAL 
			Not at all.

					DUKAT 
			I can't free Rom. He's been 
			sentenced to death by the Dominion.

					ZIYAL 
			You can pardon him. Don't you 
			see, Father, this is your chance 
			to show the Bajoran people -- to 
			show Major Kira who you really 
			are. A forgiving, compassionate 
			man -- a great man.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     30.

29   CONTINUED:

	Ziyal's passion has given Dukat a new worry -- he takes 
	his daughter's hands in his, staring into her eyes.

					DUKAT 
			Tell me, Ziyal, were you 
			involved -- in any way -- with the 
			plan to sabotage the station?

					ZIYAL
				(pulling her hands away;
				angry)
			No, I wasn't involved!

					DUKAT 
			You're sure of that? I can't help 
			you unless you tell me the truth.

					ZIYAL 
			I am telling you the truth! The 
			question is have you been telling 
			me the truth.

					DUKAT 
			About what?

					ZIYAL 
			That the Bajorans are wrong about 
			you. That you regret the horrible 
			things you had to do during the 
			occupation.

					DUKAT 
			I do regret them. Deeply.

					ZIYAL 
			Then this is your chance to prove 
			it to everyone, including me. 
			Show us that you're capable of 
			mercy.

					DUKAT 
			Rom is an enemy of the state. And 
			enemies of the state don't deserve 
			mercy.

	The words strike Ziyal's heart.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     31.

29   CONTINUED: (2)

					ZIYAL 
			Spoken like a true Cardassian.

					DUKAT 
			I am a Cardassian. And so are you.

					ZIYAL 
			No... I'm not. I could never be 
			like you.

	And with that, she turns and walks out the door. We 
	HOLD ON Dukat as he absorbs his daughter's punishing 
	words.

30   INT. QUARK'S

	Kira is at the bar talking quietly to Quark.

					KIRA
				(skeptical) 
			Nausicaans? You can't trust them.

					QUARK
			I trust latinum. And so do they. 
			Five bars will buy me five 
			Nausicaans, a fast ship and very 
			few questions. Breaking Rom out 
			of the holding cell will be 
			child's play compared to the 
			things they're used to doing.

					KIRA
			Forget it, Quark. Freeing Rom is 
			going to take careful, precise 
			planning. That's not the 
			Nausicaan way -- they're thugs. 
			They'll come strutting onto the 
			station, look at a Jem'Hadar the 
			wrong way and the next thing you 
			know there'll be blood on the 
			Promenade.

	Quark thinks it over, sees her point.

					QUARK 
			You think I can get my money back?

31   NEW ANGLE

	as Damar ENTERS and saunters up to the bar.

					DAMAR 
			Major, a freighter loaded with

			Cargo Bay Five is ready to receive 
			it.

					KIRA
			I'll take care of it.

					DAMAR 
			Yes, you will. Now.

	Kira stares at him, then deciding he's not worth a 
	confrontation, she prepares to leave. But Damar hasn't 
	had enough.

					DAMAR 
			That attitude of yours, major... 
			it won't be tolerated forever.

					KIRA
			You don't like my attitude, Damar? 
			You're welcome to try and change it.

	And with that, she walks off. We HOLD ON Damar 
	watching her leave.

					DAMAR 
			I don't understand what Dukat sees 
			in that woman.

					QUARK
			Then you need to get your eyes 
			examined.

	Damar LAUGHS and sits on a stool. Quark knows Damar's 
	drink, pouring him a glass of kanar.

					QUARK 
			One kanar. Want me to leave the 
			bottle?

	Damar nods.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     33.

31   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR 
			Maybe I should have you taste it 
			first. Make sure it isn't 
			poisoned.

					QUARK
			Poisoning customers is bad for 
			business.

					DAMAR 
			True. But some people might place 
			a brother's revenge above business.

					QUARK
			Not this Ferengi.

	Damar smiles.

					DAMAR 
			You're a credit to your race, 
			Quark. Unlike your brother, 
			you've chosen to back the winning 
			side.

	Quark studies Damar for a beat. Quark pours him 
	another drink -- a tall one.

					QUARK 
			All right, are you going to tell 
			me or do you want me to guess?

					DAMAR 
			Tell you what?

					QUARK
			Don't be coy with me. Either 
			someone you don't like has died 
			or your promotion came through.

					DAMAR 
			It's better than that.

	Damar takes a heavy swig.

					DAMAR 
			It's about the minefield.


					QUARK 
			What about it?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT TWO     34.

31   CONTINUED: (2)

					DAMAR 
			It's coming down.

					QUARK
			I've heard that before.

					DAMAR 
			Remember those field tests I was 
			telling you about? They were 
			successful. We've begun to 
			deactivate the mines.

					QUARK
				(hiding his worry) 
			Well, you've got your work cut out 
			for you. What's it going to 
			take -- a couple of months? A 
			year?

					DAMAR

				(smiling) 
			One week.

					QUARK
				(no longer hiding

			A week?

					DAMAR 
			That's right, one week and the

					SISKO 
			Gentlemen, this mission cannot

					WORF 
			We agree, Captain. But Chancellor 
			Gowron does not.

					SISKO
			Then you have to change his mind.

	The thought of being caught in a "political" situation 
	between the Federation and the Klingon Empire does not 
	appeal to Martok.

					MARTOK 
			The Chancellor is reluctant to 
			commit such a large fleet to a 
			single engagement.

					WORF 
			He feels it would leave the Empire 
			vulnerable.

					SISKO
			Starfleet Command had the same 
			concerns about Earth. But after

			decided it was worth the risk.

DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT THREE     36-37  

33   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			General, perhaps you should return 
			to Kronos and make your plea in 
			person. The Chancellor has great 
			respect for you. If you cannot 
			persuade him, no one can.

					MARTOK
			I will go see Gowron --
				(to Worf) 
			-- and you will come with me.

					WORF
				(reluctant) 
			The chancellor no longer considers 
			me a friend.

					MARTOK 
			I know. But what could be

			both telling him the same thing? 
			He'll have no choice but to agree.

					KIRA
			We've got to stop them.

					QUARK
			And end up sharing a cell with my

					KIRA
			Forget about Odo. First, we can't

					QUARK
			Then what we have to do is warn

					SISKO 
			Looks like we go without them, too. 
			We've run out of time, Admiral.

					ROSS 
				(nodding) 
			If those Dominion reinforcements 
			come through the wormhole... we'll 
			have lost everything.

42   CLOSE ON SISKO

					SISKO 
			We take the ships we have, fight 
			our way to Deep Space Nine, and 
			destroy that anti-graviton 
			emitter. It's our only hope.

42   CONTINUED:

					ROSS 
			Do it.

	And off Sisko's look of determination, we:

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

43   EXT. SPACE - TEROK NOR (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

44   INT. WARDROOM

	Dukat and Weyoun are looking out the viewing port.

					DUKAT
				(pointing) 
			There.

					WEYOUN
			Where?

					DUKAT 
			Over there. That flash of light 
			was the anti-graviton beam hitting 
			a mine.

					WEYOUN
				(putting it together) 
			And disabling its replication 
			unit...

					DUKAT 
			Exactly. Didn't you see it?

					WEYOUN 
			I'm afraid not.

					DUKAT
				(exasperated) 
			For months you've been demanding 
			that I take down those mines and 
			now that it's finally happening, 
			you can't even see it?

					WEYOUN
			Weak eyes.

	Weyoun walks away from the window.

					DUKAT 
			Excuse me?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR    42A.

44   CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN 
			My people have poor eyesight. 
			It's something we've learned to 
			live with. The Jem'Hadar, on the 
			other hand, have excellent vision. 
			I suppose they need it more than 
			we do.

					DUKAT
				(pointing)
			There's another one!

	Weyoun peers out the window, shakes his head.

					WEYOUN 
			I'll have to take your word for it.

	Dukat isn't going to let this detract from his moment --

					DUKAT 
			Once we've disabled the 
			replication units in all the 
			mines, we can detonate the entire 
			minefield.
				(a beat) 
			And I guarantee, weak eyes or not, 
			that explosion you'll see.

					WEYOUN 
			When will you be ready to proceed?

					DUKAT 
			Approximately seventy-eight hours.
				(relishing the thought) 
			Three more days and we can start 
			bringing Jem'Hadar reinforcements 
			through the wormhole.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     43.

44   CONTINUED: (2)

	Weyoun is quite excited by this news.

					WEYOUN 
			Excellent. I knew you could do 
			it, Dukat.

					DUKAT
				(skeptical) 
			Did you?

					WEYOUN
				(with absolute "Weyoun" 
				sincerity) 
			I never doubted you for a moment.

45   NEW ANGLE

	as Damar ENTERS.

					DAMAR 
			Sir, I have new information on 
			enemy fleet movements.

					DUKAT 
			Go ahead.

					DAMAR 
			The Second Fleet has fallen back 
			past the Kotanka System, while the 
			Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the 
			fighting along the Vulcan border.

	Damar crosses over to a wall monitor, taps a few keys.

46   ON THE MONITOR

	as it comes to life, displaying a star system.

					DAMAR (O.S.)
			Both fleets have converged here --

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     44.

47   RESUME

					DAMAR
				(pointing)
			-- at Starbase Three-Seven-Five.

					DUKAT 
			Isn't that where Captain Sisko is 
			stationed?

	Damar nods.

					DAMAR 
			He's been made an adjutant to 
			Admiral Ross.

					WEYOUN
				(sincere) 
			Good for him.
				(looking at the monitor) 
			Now why have those fleets gathered 
			there?

					DAMAR 
			I'm not sure.

					WEYOUN
				(forceful) 
			You're not sure? Two large enemy 
			fleets break off from the front 
			lines to rendezvous at a starbase 
			and you have no idea why?

					DUKAT 
			We'll have to find out, won't we?

					WEYOUN
			See that you do.

	Weyoun nods at Dukat and EXITS.

48   ANGLE ON DUKAT AND DAMAR

	watching him go.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     45.

48   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR
				(re: Weyoun) 
			He should speak to you with 
			greater respect.

					DUKAT 
			One day, I'll let you teach him 
			that lesson.

	Damar smiles, he looks forward to that day.

					DUKAT 
			But right now, there's something 
			more pressing I need you to do. 
			It's of a personal nature -- a 
			matter of some delicacy. It's 
			about my daughter.

	This really surprises Damar.

					DAMAR 
			Ziyal?

					DUKAT 
			We've had a misunderstanding. I 
			want you to go and convince her 
			to speak with me.

					DAMAR 
			Sir -- I really think I could be 
			more valuable tracking that enemy 
			fleet.

					DUKAT
				(getting impatient) 
			I've given you an order, Damar. 
			We're on the verge of a great 
			victory and when it comes, I want 
			my daughter by my side. Is that 
			understood?

	Damar nods, though it's clear he neither understands 
	nor fully approves of what Dukat is doing. He EXITS.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     46.

49   INT. CARGO BAY

	Kira is checking some cargo as a melancholic Ziyal 
	brings her up to date.

					ZIYAL 
			I really believed that my father 
			had changed... that he wanted to 
			be a man of peace.

					KIRA
			I think he believes that, too. 
			When it suits his purpose.

					ZIYAL 
			Everything he's ever said to me 
			has been a lie...

					KIRA
			Not everything. He really does 
			care for you.

					ZIYAL 
			I don't care. I'm not going back 
			to him.

	Kira remains silent.

					ZIYAL 
			You don't believe me, do you?

					KIRA
			Right now, you're angry and 
			disappointed. But that'll pass. 
			And then you'll have to decide 
			what to do.

	The cargo bay doors OPEN and Damar ENTERS.

					DAMAR 
			Ziyal, I need to speak to you.

					ZIYAL 
			You and I have nothing to talk 
			about.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     47.

49   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR 
			Maybe not. But you and your 
			father do. He wants to see you.

					ZIYAL 
			Well I don't want to see him.

					KIRA
				(to Damar) 
			You heard her.

					DAMAR
			Stay out of this, major.
				(to Ziyal) 
			Listen to me, Ziyal. Your father 
			is a great man. A man of destiny. 
			But he also carries great burdens. 
			He knows our alliance with the 
			Dominion is a dangerous one. If 
			we show any sign of weakness, our 
			allies will turn on us. That's 
			why we must all help your father 
			remain strong. So I ask you to 
			be a true daughter of Cardassia 
			and stand beside him.

					ZIYAL 
			It should be obvious even to you, 
			Damar, that I am not a "true 
			daughter of Cardassia."

					DAMAR 
			What's obvious to me is that your 
			father should've left you to rot 
			in that Breen prison camp.
				(a beat) 
			But he didn't. He took pity on 
			you and it's your duty to repay 
			him.

	Damar grabs her by the arm.

					DAMAR 
			Now come with me.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     48.

49   CONTINUED:	(2)

	But Kira intercedes.

					KIRA
			Leave her alone.

					DAMAR
			And if I don't? What happens then?

					KIRA

			I was hoping you'd ask.

	Kira starts to turn away, then swings back at Damar, 
	landing a solid series of blows that drive Damar 
	against the bulkhead. Kira has three months of 
	frustration to work out and she sees to it that Damar 
	is on the receiving end of every bit of it. By the 
	time she's finished with him, Damar is an unconscious 
	lump on the floor.

					ZIYAL
			Did you kill him?

	Kira catches her breath, and checks Damar for a pulse.

					KIRA
			No, but I thought about it.

					ZIYAL
			What are you going to do when he
			wakes up?

					KIRA
			That's up to him.

	And as the two women walk away, we go to --

50   EXT. SPACE - STARBASE 375 (OPTICAL)

	TIGHT ON the Starbase.

50A  INT. SISKO'S OFFICE

	Sisko is seated, studying a Bajoran PADD. Admiral Ross 
	ENTERS.

					ROSS
			I thought I'd stop by and wish you
			luck.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR    48A.

50A  CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			Thanks. My father says you can 
			never have too much luck.

					ROSS 
			Your father sounds like a wise man.

					SISKO
				(nodding)
			And he makes a good jambalaya.

	Ross smiles appreciatively as Sisko puts the PADD down 
	on the table.

					ROSS
				(re: the PADD) 
			What's this?

					SISKO
			It's the Bajoran Ancient Texts.

					ROSS 
			The Emissary looks for guidance 
			on the eve of battle?

					SISKO
			Guidance, insights... loopholes. 
			I'll take anything I can get.

					ROSS 
			And what do the Prophets tell you?

					SISKO

			That I have a long way to go 
			before I can make any sense of 
			their prophecies.

	Sisko stands up and prepares to leave.

					ROSS 
			Maybe when this war's over you'll 
			get the chance to study them 
			closer.

					SISKO
			It would be a welcome change.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR    48B.

51   INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ENGINEERING

	O'Brien emerges from Engineering to find Nog 
	approaching. Nog is now wearing a shiny new ensign's 
	uniform -- engineering gold.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     49.

51   CONTINUED:

					NOG 
			Chief, I was just coming to see 
			you.
				(re: his uniform) 
			Can you believe it? They made me 
			an ensign.

					O'BRIEN
				(dry) 
			I didn't realize that things were 
			going so bad.

					NOG 
			Scary, isn't it?

	O'Brien and Nog start moving down the corridor.

					NOG 
			If my classmates at the Academy 
			could only see me now...

					O'BRIEN
			They'd be surprised, would they?

					NOG 
			Amazed is more like it.

					O'BRIEN
				(dismissive) 
			What do they know.

					NOG 
			Anyway, I just wanted to say 
			thanks for all your help.

					O'BRIEN
			My help?

					NOG 
			I've learned a lot from you -- and 
			not just about engineering. 
			You've shown me what it takes to 
			be a good soldier.

					O'BRIEN
			Well don't let that uniform go to 
			your head. You've got a lot to 
			learn yet.

	Nog nods.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FOUR     50.

51   CONTINUED: (2)

					O'BRIEN
			And you will.

	Nog looks over at O'Brien, who gives him a small smile.

					O'BRIEN
			Congratulations, ensign. Wear it
			with pride.

					NOG
			I intend to, Chief.

52   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	Dax is in the Captain's Chair. Bashir stands beside 
	her. O'Brien and Nog ENTER and as they head for their 
	stations, lead us to Sisko and Garak, also ENTERING 
	from the other door.

					NOG
			Captain on the bridge.

	Garak takes his place alongside Bashir as Sisko moves 
	to Dax.

					DAX
				(getting out of the chair)
			I've kept it warm for you, Ben.

	Dax moves over to her station at the helm. Sisko looks 
	around at the Bridge. His crew looks back at him 
	expectantly.

	Sisko sits in the Captain's Chair.

					SISKO
			Ensign, alert all ships. we're
			moving out.

					NOG
			Aye, sir.

	FADE IN:

54   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Weyoun is listening to Dukat.

					DUKAT 
			Our initial intelligence reports 
			have been verified. The 
			Federation fleet is on the move.

					WEYOUN
			Do we know their destination?

					DUKAT 
			It would appear they're headed 
			here.

					WEYOUN
			Here?

	He thinks about it for a moment, then a smile dances 
	across his lips.

					WEYOUN 
			He knows we're taking down the
			minefield.
				(a hard look) 
			Someone must've gotten a message 
			out.

					DUKAT 
			So it would seem.

					WEYOUN
			No matter. We'll crush them.

	Dukat hands Weyoun a PADD.

					DUKAT 
			Yes, we will. And in order to do 
			that, we're going to have to pull 
			a significant number of our ships 
			off the front lines.

					WEYOUN
			Do it.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FIVE     53.

54   CONTINUED:

	Damar ENTERS, his face bruised from his encounter with 
	Kira. Dukat's attention immediately goes to Damar.

					WEYOUN 
			Once the minefield comes down, 
			there'll be more than enough ships 
			to take their place.

					DUKAT
				(nodding impatiently to 
				Weyoun) 
			I understand. One moment.

	Dukat moves to Damar.

					DAMAR 
			I want your permission to arrest 
			Major Kira.

					DUKAT
				(sotto voce) 
			Kira? What about Ziyal -- did you 
			talk to her?

					DAMAR
				(nodding) 
			She doesn't want to see you. When 
			I insisted, the major... objected.

	Dukat is furious but, aware that Weyoun is in the room, 
	he controls his temper and voice.

					DUKAT 
			What did you do to Ziyal?

					DAMAR 
			I did nothing to her.

					DUKAT 
			Then why did Kira attack you? You 
			must've done something... 
			threatened my daughter in some 
			way. I told you to be tactful.

	Weyoun is impatient with this interruption.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FIVE     54.

54   CONTINUED: (2)

					WEYOUN 
			Excuse me, but don't you think 
			resolving family squabbles can 
			wait until after we've won this 
			war?
				(smiles at Dukat) 
			Weak eyes, good ears.

					DUKAT
				(chagrined) 
			Yes, of course. You're quite 
			right.

					WEYOUN
			Then you're clear on what must be 
			done.

					DUKAT 
			We will call back enough ships to 
			destroy the Federation fleet and 
			hold this station.

	And with that, Weyoun nods and EXITS.

					DAMAR
				(excited) 
			The Federation is moving against 
			us?

					DUKAT 
			That's right. Now I want to hear 
			exactly what went on between you 
			and Ziyal.

55   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	The Female Shape-shifter and Odo gaze down upon the 
	passing crowd.

					ODO 
			Odd. I've stood here countless 
			times... yet somehow everything 
			looks different.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's the Solids. They look small, 
			don't they? Insignificant.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FIVE     55.

55   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			It's not their fault.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'm not placing blame.

					ODO
			They're trapped.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Confined to a single shape.

					ODO
			A single perspective.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's so limiting.

					ODO
			I feel sorry for them.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			They need our guidance, Odo. Not
			our pity.

					ODO
			They cherish their freedom.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(pointed)
			We'll have to break them of that.

	And there's something about the way she says it -- 
	so cold, so clinical, so frightening -- that it snaps Odo 
	out of his reverie.

					ODO
			Break them?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			In a manner of speaking. This
			language of the Solids... it's so
			imprecise.

 					ODO
			What exactly do you plan to do?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FIVE    55A.

55   CONTINUED: (2)

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			The Solids are no longer your 
			concern, Odo.
				(a beat) 
			What must be done, will be done. 
			It's as simple as that.

	It doesn't sound very simple to Odo, but before he can 
	question her further, Weyoun approaches reverentially.

					WEYOUN
				(to the Female Shape-shifter) 
			Forgive me for intruding but I 
			have important news about the 
			war.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Why don't you return to your 
			quarters, Odo. I'll join you 
			there shortly.

	Odo hesitates.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Everything will be fine. I 
			promise.

	Odo nods, but it's clear that he is not convinced. He 
	EXITS.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Favor the Bold" - REV. 9/5/97 - ACT FIVE     56.

55   CONTINUED: (3)

					WEYOUN 
			I must say, you're doing a 
			wonderful job with Odo.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Meaning what?

					WEYOUN
			Meaning that he's always posed a 
			potential threat to our plans. 
			But you seem to have... 
			neutralized him quite nicely.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Neutralize Odo? Is that why you 
			think I'm here? Odo is a 
			changeling. Bringing him home -- 
			returning him to the Great Link 
			means more to us than the Alpha 
			Quadrant itself. Is that clear?

					WEYOUN
				(backpedaling)
			I meant no disrespect...

	The Female Shape-shifter stares impassively at Weyoun, 
	who grows more and more nervous under her gaze. 
	Finally, the Shape-shifter offers a thin smile.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Of course you didn't. You are 
			what you are... a loyal subject 
			of the Dominion. Come, walk with 
			me. You said you had important 
			news...

	And as they walk off --

56   INT. PROMENADE - LOWER LEVEL

	A troubled Odo heads for his quarters when he spots

58   ON ODO

	racing towards her and calling out:

					ODO
			Major!

59   ON KIRA

	who doesn't hear him or is too preoccupied to respond. 
	The turbolift doors close behind her.

	Odo races up to the turbolift, too late. Unwilling to 
	pass up this opportunity to speak to her, Odo rushes 
	off to catch another turbolift.

60   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	Kira emerges from a turbolift and heads down the 
	corridor.

61   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Odo turns a corner and runs to catch up to Kira.

					ODO
			Kira.

	Kira turns, sees Odo, and tries to ignore him 
	continuing on her way. Odo catches up to her anyway.

					ODO
			Wait, please.

					KIRA
			I have nothing to say to you.

					ODO
			I understand that you're angry.

					KIRA
			You bet I'm angry.

	Kira stops and faces Odo.

	Kira resumes walking, leaving Odo to catch up again.

					ODO 
			It's so difficult to explain...

					KIRA
				(unmoved)
			If you're going to tell me about

	Odo takes Kira's arm to stop her. They face each other.

					ODO 
			I'm sorry.

					KIRA
			Sorry?
				(laughing) 
			That's what you wanted to say to

					ODO
			Yes.

					KIRA 
			Let me tell you something, Odo.

	Kira breaks free of Odo's grip.

					KIRA
			We are way past "sorry."
