1    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

A bewildered JAKE faces CAPTAIN SISKO.

					JAKE
			Did they say why you can't marry 
			Kasidy?

					SISKO
			The Prophets aren't saying I 
			can't, they're saying I 
			shouldn't.

					JAKE
			It's the same thing. I don't see 
			why it's any of their business.

					SISKO
			Everything I do is their 
			business.

	Jake can't argue with that.

					JAKE
			Have you told Kasidy?

					SISKO
			Not yet. She's on a cargo run. 
			Won't be back for a couple of 
			days.

					JAKE
			And when she gets back, what are 
			you going to tell her? That one 
			of the Prophets, who says she's 
			your mother, Sarah, told you not 
			to marry her?

					SISKO
			Jake -- you're not making me feel 
			better.

	But before Jake can respond --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - TEASER      2.

1    CONTINUED: 

					KIRA'S COM VOICE 
			Captain, Kai Winn is here to see 
			you.


	Sisko sighs. He isn't looking forward to this.

					SISKO
			Send her in.
				(to Jake)
			We'll talk later.

	Jake heads for one of the side doors and EXITS. A 
	beat later, KAI WINN ENTERS from Ops. Her two 
	Ranjens take up position just outside the door (one 
	is an N.D., the other is the venerable SOLBOR).

					SISKO
			Your Eminence.

	Sisko's wedding is upstaging Winn yet again, but she 
	does her best to act happy about it.

					WINN 
			Congratulations, Emissary. I'm 
			very happy for you.

	Sisko manages a polite nod, despite his misgivings 
	about the Prophets' warning.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - TEASER      3.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					WINN 
			This wedding is a momentous event 
			for Bajor. I want to be sure the 
			proceedings reflect its 
			importance, so I've come to 
			assist in the preparations.

					SISKO
			That's very kind of you, but I'm 
			not sure it's necessary.

					WINN
				("sweetly") 
			There's no need to thank me. I'm 
			glad to do it.
				(beat) 
			I understand you asked Vedek 
			Telna to perform the ceremony.

	Winn sees this as a snub, and plays vaguely hurt.

					WINN 
			Perhaps you thought I wasn't 
			available, but since I'm here, 
			I'm sure you agree that it would 
			be more appropriate for me to do 
			it.

	Sisko doesn't know quite what to say -- he's not 
	even sure there's going to be a wedding.

					WINN
				(taking his
				hesitation as a
				yes)
			I'll talk to Vedek Telna. I'm
			certain he'll be willing to step
			aside.

	Winn smiles at Sisko as if she's glad it's settled.

					WINN 
			These are joyful days indeed. 
			You've given the Prophets reason 
			to smile.

	Winn sees the twinge of doubt flicker across Sisko's 
	features.

					WINN 
			Is something wrong, Emissary? 
			You seem troubled.

	Sisko considers whether he should tell her.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - TEASER      4.

1    CONTINUED:	(3) 

					SISKO
			The Prophets came to me in a 
			vision...

	Winn can't stand the fact that the Prophets speak to 
	Sisko and not her, but she does her best to hide it.

					WINN 
			I see...

					SISKO
			They warned me that I'm going to 
			have to face a great "Trial."

					WINN 
			Did they say what it would be?

					SISKO
			I'm afraid not. The Prophets 
			don't always make themselves 
			clear.

	Winn suspects that Sisko knows more, but is keeping 
	it from her.

					WINN 
			I wouldn't know. They've never 
			spoken to me... directly. 
				(beat) 
			In any case, I know that you're 

			willing to do whatever the 
			Prophets ask.

	In the face of her faith, Sisko can't bring himself 
	to say that he's considering going against the 
	Prophets' wishes. Winn stands to go --

					WINN 
			I'll pray that they give you the 
			strength to face your Trial. I 
			sense you're going to need it.

	With that, she turns and EXITS. Off Sisko's 
	troubled face as he watches her go...

2    INT. OPS

	as Winn ENTERS and joins her two Ranjens. KIRA is 
	standing at her post.

					KIRA 
			May I show you to your quarters?

			Thank you, my child.

	As Winn starts down the stairs, suddenly the SCREEN 
	WHITES OUT and we --

	As the SCREEN WHITES IN, Winn finds herself near the 
	entrance to the Temple. We hear the same HEARTBEAT 
	SOUND that accompanies an Orb experience, and the 
	scene has that same look.

	As Winn turns to get her bearings, she sees the 
	Solbor Alien standing nearby.

					SOLBOR ALIEN
			Her pagh is strong.

					WINN
				(confused)
			Solbor?

	Suddenly the Kira Alien is behind her.

					KIRA ALIEN
			She will serve us well.


	Winn realizes that these people aren't who they 
	appear to be, and it suddenly hits her what's 
	happening.

					WINN
				(awed)
			Prophets...

Winn kneels and bows her head.

					WINN 
			I've waited so long for you to 
			speak to me. How can I serve 
			you?

	Suddenly the Sisko Alien is nearby.

					SISKO ALIEN 
			The Sisko has faltered. You must 
			bring the Restoration.

					WINN 
			The Restoration?

					SOLBOR ALIEN 
			Bajor's fate rests with you.

					WINN 
			Tell me what to do.

					KIRA ALIEN 
			The Guide will reveal the way.

					WINN 
			What "Guide?"

					SISKO ALIEN 
			He will come to you.

					WINN 
			How will I know him?

					SOLBOR ALIEN 
			He will have the wisdom of the 
			land.

					KIRA
			Eminence, are you all right?

	Winn is so stunned by what happened to her it takes 
	her a moment to focus. She looks at Kira, manages a 
	nod...

					KIRA
			What happened... ?

11   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	A Breen ship rips along at high warp.

12   INT. BREEN CELL

	EZRI sits on the bench. WORF's pacing, thinking out 
	loud.

					WORF 
			They will be feeding us soon. If 
			we position ourselves on both 
			sides of the door, we might be 
			able to disarm the first Breen 
			that comes through and --

					EZRI 
			Face it, Worf -- the old "guard-
			my-cellmate-is-ill" trick didn't 
			work. Neither did your "I'll-
			make-a-tool-and-short-circuit-the-
			door" idea.

					WORF 
			We must not give up. The first 
			duty of any captured officer is 
			to attempt escape.

	Suddenly the door slides OPEN and TWO BREEN ENTER. 
	The first grips a NEURAL TRUNCHEON, which he keeps 
	pointed at Worf. The second holds two small 
	CANISTERS, which he tosses to the prisoners. They 
	catch them with a practiced ease that tells us this 
	has become a ritual.

					EZRI 
				(wry) 
			What's the special today?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT ONE     10.

12   CONTINUED:

	Ezri pops open the lid.

					EZRI 
			Algae paste. My favorite.

	The Breen stare at her for a beat, then turn and 
	EXIT, the door sliding SHUT behind them. Worf opens 
	his container and dips two fingers into the blackish-
	green muck. He brings them to his mouth and licks 
	them. Ezri stares at the door thoughtfully.

					EZRI 
			I wonder what the Breen look like 
			under those helmets...

					WORF 
			They say that no one has ever 
			seen one and lived to speak of 
			it.

					EZRI 
			Maybe they're all furry... ? It's 
			supposed to be really cold on 
			Breen.

					WORF
			One thing is certain...

					EZRI
				(licking her finger) 
			They're lousy cooks?

					WORF 
			They are dangerous. They do not 
			tolerate incursions into their 
			space. During the Second Empire, 
			Chancellor Mow'ga sent a fleet of 
			Klingon ships to conquer their 
			homeworld. They were never heard 
			from again.

	Worf considers for a beat...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT ONE     11.

12   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WORF 
			We've been traveling for three 
			days. We could be in Breen space 
			by now.

					EZRI 
			Well, I don't think we should 
			rule out the possibility that 
			they saw our shuttle crash and 
			decided to take us back to Deep 
			Space Nine.

	Worf gives her a baffled look, then realizes.

					WORF
			You are being humorous.

					EZRI 
			Not very, I guess.

					WORF 
			Jadzia would also use humor to 
			keep her spirits up.

					EZRI 
			You didn't laugh much at her 
			jokes, either.

	Worf pushes his food away and gazes at her with
	affection.

					WORF
			You are a lot like her.

	Something about the way he's looking at her sets off 
	an alarm bell for Ezri. Suddenly she has the 
	feeling that Worf is in some ways trying to 
	recapture the relationship he lost when Jadzia died.

					EZRI

				(yes and no)
			In some ways...

	Worf tenderly brushes a lock of hair from her 
	forehead.

					WORF 
			I thought I'd lost her forever... 
			but you and I will have many 
			years together.

	WEYOUN's framed in the doorway, peering into the 
	dark room. We hear CARDASSIAN SNORING from 
	somewhere off camera. Weyoun wrinkles his nose at 
	the stale smell of the room.

					WEYOUN 
			Computer, lights.

	The LIGHTS COME ON. DAMAR, in uniform, is sprawled 
	upon the dirty tangle of sheets on his bed, an empty 
	bottle of KANAR gripped in one hand.

					WEYOUN
			Damar.

	Damar wakes and bolts upright, hair asunder, eyes 
	bleary and disoriented. When his gaze falls on 
	Weyoun --

					DAMAR
			What are you doing here?

	Weyoun regards him with ill-disguised contempt.

					WEYOUN 
			Since you're ignoring your com-

					DAMAR

			I worked late last night.

	Weyoun picks a lady's GARMENT off the bed.

					WEYOUN 
			Yes, I can see that.
				(drops the clothing) 
			Get yourself cleaned up. We're 
			leaving this afternoon.

					DAMAR 
			Leaving? Where are we going?

					WEYOUN 
			You needn't concern yourself with 
			that.

					DAMAR
				(annoyed) 
			Why didn't you tell me about this 
			before? I have things to attend 
			to.

					WEYOUN 
			You mean your business with 
			Dukat?

	Damar's surprised that Weyoun knows anything about 
	Dukat.

					WEYOUN
				(smiles) 
			Did you really think I didn't 
			know he was here?

	Damar says nothing, for fear of making the situation 
	worse.

					WEYOUN
				(shaking his head) 
			Masquerading as a Bajoran... what 
			is he up to this time... ?

					DAMAR 
			He wouldn't say.

	For a moment we think Weyoun is going to lay into 
	him, but instead he smiles.

					WEYOUN 
			Such loyalty. It would be 
			inspiring if it weren't so 
			misplaced.

	And with that, Weyoun smiles and EXITS. Damar 
	stares at the empty doorway for a beat, then moves 
	to find another bottle of Kanar.

			And your identity documents.

					DUKAT 
			You don't look well.

					DAMAR 
			I'm fine.

	Dukat shakes his head sadly.

					DUKAT 
			What happened to the brave 
			officer I served with? The one 
			who stood at my side as we fought 
			the entire Klingon Empire with a

					DAMAR

			Those were simpler times.

			Those days might be gone, but the

			You were its leader once. You

			The Pah-wraiths have shown me

25A  INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON A BAJORAN SHAWL
	(FORMERLY SCENE 14)

	The fine cloth is covered with an intricate pattern
	of vivid colors and exquisite embroidery.

	The cloth begins to turn. We REVEAL that a smiling
	Kasidy Yates is wearing it over her hair. She faces
	a brooding Sisko, who's sitting on the couch. Her
	TRAVEL BAG is on the floor by the door.

					KASIDY 
			Bajorans consider it good luck 
			for a bride to wear a Navatan 
			shawl.
				(off his distracted
				expression)
			What's the matter -- you don't
			like it?

					SISKO
			It's lovely.

					KASIDY
			Then why the long face?

	Sisko gestures to the couch.

					SISKO
			We need to talk.

	Kasidy sits down next to him.

					KASIDY 
			Why do I have the feeling I'm not 
			going to like this?

	She looks at him as they sit, hoping he'll say 
	something to alleviate her apprehension. Instead, 
	he sighs painfully and plunges into it.

					SISKO
			A few days ago, one of the 
			Prophets came to me in a vision. 
			It was Sarah.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     23.

25A  CONTINUED:

					KASIDY 
			Your mother.

	Sisko nods. He knows he has to tell her the rest, 
	but can't seem to find the right words.

					KASIDY
				(almost afraid to
				ask)
			What did she want?

	Sisko sees no other way to do this than to simply 
	lay it out.

					SISKO
			She told me that the path I was 
			meant to walk...
				(with difficulty)

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     24.

25A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO (Cont'd)
			-- is for me alone. That you 
			can't walk it with me.

	It takes a moment for the reality of what he is 
	saying to hit her.

					KASIDY
				(choked with 
				emotion) 
			Why?

					SISKO
			She said I'd know nothing but 
			sorrow if I ignored her warning.

					KASIDY 
			That almost sounds like a threat.

					SISKO
			No, it wasn't anything like that. 
			She was worried for me. Like... 
			a mother would be.

	Kasidy wills herself to ask a question she's afraid 
	to hear the answer to.

					KASIDY 
			What are you going to do?

	Sisko tries to put off saying what he's feeling.

					SISKO
			Kas, the Prophets can see things 
			we can't... if she was that 
			concerned, it must be for a good 
			reason.

					KASIDY 
			You're not answering my question.

					SISKO
				(anguished) 
			Kasidy, I love you. I want to be 
			with you...

	Kasidy can see that he can't bring himself to say 
	it.

					KASIDY 
			Then be with me Ben.

					SISKO
			I can't... I can't go against the 
			Prophets...

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO 25-26.    

25A  CONTINUED:	(3)

	Kasidy fights the tears she feels welling up.

					SISKO
			Kasidy, please try to understand.

	She stands and slowly removes the RING Sisko gave 
	her and places it on the shawl at her side. She 
	crosses to the door, picks up her travel bag and 
	EXITS without looking back.

	Sisko looks down at the ring sitting atop the shawl, 
	frustrated and full of regret.

	The Breen ship continues at warp.

27   INT. BREEN CELL

	Worf and Ezri are asleep on the bench, but she's 
	stirring uncomfortably.

					EZRI
				(far away)
			No... no...

	Worf stirs, realizes she's having a nightmare.

					WORF
				(shaking her awake)
			Ezri...

	She bolts upright and cries out --

					EZRI
			No.

	Worf tries to calm her --

					WORF 
			It's all right -- you were only 
			dreaming.

	Ezri looks around, still panicked.

					EZRI
			Where are we... ?

					WORF 
			We're still aboard the Breen 
			ship.

					EZRI
				(remembering) 
			They were chasing me... in an ice 
			cave... it was so cold I could 
			barely breathe...

					WORF
			Shh... it's over now...

					EZRI 
			I couldn't get away... every time 
			I looked back they were right
			behind me... Then one of them 
			grabbed me with this big claw.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     28.

27   CONTINUED:

					WORF 
			Breen do not have claws.

					EZRI 
			How do you know? Besides, it was 
			a dream. Dreams are full of 
			things that don't seem to make 
			sense.

					WORF 
			That is why it's best to ignore 
			them.

					EZRI 
			How can you say that? Dreams 
			contain valuable insights. 
			Sometimes the things that don't 
			seem to make sense are actually 
			the key to what your unconscious 
			is trying to tell you.

	Worf frowns as Ezri pushes on --

					EZRI 
			Anyway, I got away from him... 
			but there wasn't any place to 
			run. And just when I thought he 
			was going to kill me, he reached 
			up and took off his helmet.

					WORF
				(despite himself) 
			And?

					EZRI
				(knowing how strange 
				it is) 
			And... it was Julian.

					WORF 
			Doctor Bashir?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     29.

27   CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI 
			Isn't that strange? I wonder 
			what it means?

					WORF
				(dry) 
			That Doctor Bashir is a Breen?

					EZRI 
			Very funny.
				(more to herself) 
			The cave could symbolize the 
			womb. My subconscious could be 
			trying to tell me that I need to 
			confront emotions I repressed at 
			birth.
				(suddenly confused) 
			But which one? I've been born 
			nine times.

					WORF 
			This is ridiculous.

	Ezri's stung by his brusque dismissal.

					EZRI 
			I'm a counselor. Analyzing 
			dreams is part of my job.

					WORF
			Jadzia never talked about her
			dreams.

					EZRI 
			Well, I'm not Jadzia -- am I?

	Before Worf can respond, the cell door OPENS and 
	THREE BREEN pour inside, holding their weapons and 
	truncheons like they mean business. The First uses 
	his weapon to hold Ezri at bay, while the Second and 
	Third move toward Worf.

	The Third Breen steps close to Worf, then suddenly 
	emits a strange metallic SCREECH. Worf starts at 
	the sudden, jarring sound, but stands his ground.

	The Breen uses his truncheon to motion toward the 
	door, but Worf defiantly crosses his arms in front 
	of him and stays put.

	The Breen turns to his companion, emits a short 
	SCREECH, and gets a SCREECH in reply.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     30.

27   CONTINUED:	(3)

	Suddenly he moves to jab Worf with his truncheon --
	Worf raises an arm to parry, but as soon as its tip 
	touches him he's jolted by some sort of energy.

	Every muscle in his body instantly tenses up and he 
	collapses to the ground. Ezri instinctively steps 
	forward to intercede, but the First Breen jabs her 
	and she falls to the ground as well.

	The Breen grab hold of Worf and start to drag him 
	from the cell.

					EZRI
				(getting to her
				feet) 
			Where are you taking him?

	But the door slides SHUT in her face. Off Ezri's 
	worried expression...

29   INT. KAI WINN'S QUARTERS

	Winn stands before a Bajoran SHRINE that's been set 
	up in the room. She lights a CANDLE and places it 
	on the shrine, where several other CANDLES 
	already burn.

					WINN
			... make me worthy of your great 
			task. Grant me the strength not 
			to fail you...

	As Winn concludes her devotions and turns from the 
	altar, Solbor ENTERS behind her.

					SOLBOR 
			Eminence?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     31.

29   CONTINUED:

					WINN 
			Yes?

					SOLBOR 
			There's a man here who's 
			requested an audience with you.

	Winn enjoys seeing supplicants, and she's feeling 
	generous today.

					WINN 
			Show him in.


	Solbor nods and ducks back the way he came. Winn 
	finishes her devotions, and turns to see --

30   DUKAT

	in the doorway with Solbor. He acts like a humble 
	man, nervous in the presence of a great figure.

					SOLBOR 
			This is Anjohl Tennan, from 
			Relliketh.

					WINN 
			Welcome, my son.

					DUKAT
				(bowing his head) 
			Thank you for seeing me, 
			eminence.

					WINN 
			How can I help you?

					DUKAT 
			I've come to ask your blessing, 
			so that I may have prosperity in 
			the coming season.

					WINN 
			What is it you do?

					DUKAT 
			I'm just a simple man of the 
			land.

	The phrase sends a chill through the Kai.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT TWO     32.

30   CONTINUED:

					WINN
				(tremulously)
			Of the land... ?

					DUKAT
			I'm a farmer. I grow moba and --


	Seeking confirmation, Winn suddenly reaches toward 
	his left ear to feel his pagh. She reacts as if 
	sensing something powerful. A beat, then she lets 
	go... and a smile of anticipation spreads across her 
	features.

					WINN
			Your pagh is strong, Anjohl.
				(beat)
			I've been waiting for you...

	Winn is playing right into Dukat's hands, but he 
	acts like a simple man who doesn't understand what 
	she means. Off the wonder in Winn's face as she 
	contemplates the power of the Prophets...

31   INT. KAI WINN'S QUARTERS

	Winn and Dukat are seated as Solbor carries in a TEA 
	TRAY with an ORNATE TEAPOT, CUPS and LINEN NAPKINS. 
	Dukat acts as if he's not worthy of this treatment, 
	and rises to assist --

					DUKAT 
			Let me help you. It's not right 
			for a Ranjen to wait on a common 
			farmer.

	Solbor's face tells us he agrees, but Winn motions 
	that Dukat be seated.

					WINN
			Sit. You're our guest.

	Dukat complies, and Solbor begins to pour the tea.

32   WINN

	watches Dukat carefully. She's convinced this 
	apparent innocent contains hidden depths of 
	knowledge that he himself is unaware of.

					WINN
				(when he's finished) 
			Thank you, Solbor.

					SOLBOR
				(bowing his head) 
			Your eminence.

	With a last glance Dukat's way, Solbor EXITS. Dukat 
	unfolds his napkin, marveling at its texture.

	He picks up his teacup as if he's afraid he's going 
	to spill it in his clumsiness.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT THREE    34.

32   CONTINUED:

					DUKAT 
			If I told my neighbors I had tea 
			with the Kai, they'd never 
			believe it.

	Winn smiles, tries to put him at ease.

					WINN 
			Tell me about yourself, Anjohl. 
			You came here to pray for 
			prosperity. Have things been 
			difficult for you?

					DUKAT 
			Yes... Rogath blight destroyed my 
			entire crop last year.

					WINN
			I'm sorry to hear that...

					DUKAT 
			Most of the farms in Relliketh 
			fell victim to it.

					WINN
				(more to herself) 
			"And the land shall be poisoned 
			by a great evil."
				(off his look) 
			It's from the Ancient Texts. 
			Talnot's Prophecy of the Final 
			Days.

					DUKAT
			I see...

					WINN 
			Tell me more about this blight.

					DUKAT 
			Unfortunately the only way to 
			eradicate it is to burn your 
			fields at the first sign of 
			contamination.

	Winn listens intently, trying to assemble some 
	spiritual message from his words.

					WINN 
			Go on.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT THREE    35.

32   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DUKAT 
			Then you let your land lie fallow 
			for a season -- to allow for the 
			restoration of the soil.

					WINN
				(intent) 
			Restoration?

					DUKAT
				(nods) 
			The following year, the fields 
			will be fertile again.

					WINN
				(turning it over in 
				her mind) 
			The poison must be purged away... 
			so the land can be reborn.

					DUKAT
				(puzzled by her
				strange words)
			Eminence... ?

					WINN 
			Do you pray to the Prophets, 
			Anjohl?

					DUKAT 
			Every day.

					WINN 
			And have they ever answered you --
			in a vision, or in your dreams?

					DUKAT 
			There have been times when I've 
			thought I felt their presence. 
			But spoken to me? No. Surely 
			they'd reserve such a blessing 
			for someone like you.

					WINN 
			You're right, the Prophets have 
			spoken to me.
				(beat) 
			They told me they were going to 
			send you here.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT THREE    36.

32   CONTINUED:	(3)

					DUKAT
				(at a loss)
			Me?

					WINN 
			You've been blessed, Anjohl. 
			They have anointed you to be my 
			Guide.

					DUKAT
			I don't understand...

					WINN 
			You are to help me bring about 
			the Restoration of Bajor.

	Dukat is clearly overwhelmed...

					DUKAT 
			Surely the Prophets would choose 
			someone more worthy.

					WINN 
			You should have more faith in 
			yourself, Anjohl. And in the 
			Prophets.

					DUKAT
				(chastened)
			Of course...

					WINN 
			Rest assured, they'll reveal what 
			they want from us... and 
			together, we'll walk the path 
			they've laid out...

	And off this ominous prospect...

33   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Kira is reporting to Sisko, who's sitting at his 
	desk studying a PADD.

			... the bottom line is, the chief

33   CONTINUED:

	Sisko tosses the PADD down in front of him.

					SISKO
			Not good enough.

	Kira is taken off-guard by his gruff response.

					SISKO
			I told General Martok his ships 
			would be repaired by tomorrow.

					KIRA 
			We've got Engineering crews 
			working twenty-six hours a day. 
			We're doing the best we can.

	Sisko takes a breath and backs off.

					SISKO
			I know you are.
				(beat) 
			Things are just a little... 
			complicated for me right now...

					KIRA
				(with sympathy)
			I can imagine...

	Sisko studies her for a beat, decides to confide in 
	her.

					SISKO
			The Prophets came to me... they 
			told me that Kasidy and I aren't 
			meant to walk the same path.

	Kira takes a moment to assimilate this information.

					KIRA 
			I see... well, that explains 
			that.
				(a beat) 
			I'm sorry.

					SISKO
			So am I.

	Kira can see that Sisko is torn, tries to offer him 
	some support.

					KIRA 
			The Prophets wouldn't ask you to 
			do something like that without a 
			reason.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT THREE    38.

33   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Sisko can't keep the tinge of resentment from his 
	voice.

					SISKO
			You'd think they'd tell me what 
			it is.

					KIRA
			It doesn't always work that way, 
			you know that.
				(beat) 
			What they're asking isn't easy. 
			But they've never led you down 
			the wrong path.

	Sisko has to admit they haven't.

					SISKO
			Not so far. But there's always a 
			first time.
				(anger rising) 
			To them, I'm "The Sisko" -- an 
			instrument for carrying out their 
			wishes. They forget that I'm 
			human -- with dreams and wishes 
			of my own. They say marrying 
			Kasidy is a mistake. Maybe it is 
			but it's my mistake to make.

	Kira doesn't have an answer for him, all she has is 
	her faith.

					KIRA 
			I wouldn't go against the 
			Prophets.
				(beat) 
			You're doing the right thing.

	A moment between them.

	He moves to the FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER, who's at a side

	She waves him off, stands straight again.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			About Damar -- I trust he won't

			I'm sure he'll have "concerns,"

	Pumped with adrenaline, Worf instinctively goes at

	Winn begins to fill his GLASS.

					WINN 
			It's a rare vintage, from before 
			the Occupation. I was going to 
			give this bottle to the Emissary 
			as a wedding gift.

					DUKAT
			I'm honored that you'd choose to 
			share it with me.

	Winn floats a seemingly casual observation, but it's 
	intended to probe her "Guide's" feelings about 
	Sisko.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT FOUR    45.

43   CONTINUED:


					WINN
			I doubt he would've been able to 
			appreciate it as much. Not being 
			Bajoran.

	Dukat plays it as if he's hesitant to raise a 
	controversial subject.

					DUKAT 
			I suppose not. The Prophets may 
			have chosen to speak through him, 
			but he's not truly one of us, is 
			he?

	Winn leans in, sensing they have similar opinions 
	about Sisko.


					WINN 
			No, he isn't.

					DUKAT 
			There are times when I find 
			myself wondering if he really 
			understands our people.

	Dukat catches himself, as if he thinks he's said too 
	much.

					DUKAT 
			Still. It's not my place to 
			question why the Prophets would 
			choose him to be their Emissary.

					WINN 
			You forget that the Prophets 
			chose you to be my Guide. Speak 
			your mind freely, Anjohl.

	Dukat takes the license she's offered him.

					DUKAT 
			The Emissary didn't suffer 
			through the Occupation. 
			He has no idea what the 
			Cardassians did to us. Those 
			years left many scars on Bajor's 
			soul -- how can he help heal what 
			he could never comprehend?

	Winn is lapping it up, he's feeding the resentments 
	she's kept to herself for a long time.

					WINN 
			I've often asked myself the same 
			thing.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT FOUR    46.

43   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DUKAT 
			I survived the Occupation purely 
			by chance. When the Resistance 
			destroyed the Cardassian outpost 
			in Relliketh, Gul Dukat had a 
			hundred Bajorans rounded up. His 
			intention was to send us to the 
			capital for public execution.

	Something in Dukat's story jogs Winn's memory. She 
	leans forward with an intent look in her eyes.

					WINN 
			One hundred from Relliketh... 
			when did this occur?

					DUKAT 
			Just before the great famine.

	Winn nods, a memory coming back to her.

					DUKAT 
			By sheer luck, my transport was 
			rerouted to a labor camp. Years 
			later, I learned that a 
			dispatcher misread the orders.

	Winn stares at him, stunned.

					WINN 
			His name was Prenar. And he 
			didn't misread the orders.

					DUKAT
				(puzzled) 
			How could you know that?

	Winn tells her story with a faraway look in her 
	eyes, as if she can scarcely believe the coincidence 
	herself.

					WINN 
			I was a Ranjen in those days... I 
			convinced the Vedek who led my 
			order that we needed to take a 
			more active role in the 
			Resistance... He let me remove 
			some gemstones from our 
			tabernacle... I used them to 
			bribe various Cardassians in 
			exchange for small acts of 
			leniency.
				(beat)
			Prenar was one of them.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT FOUR    47.


43   CONTINUED:	(3)

					WINN (Cont'd)
			I paid him to reroute a transport
			from Relliketh.

	Now it's Dukat's turn to be "stunned."

					DUKAT
			You saved my life... 

	He reaches across the table and --

44   TAKES HER HAND

	in a gesture of gratitude.

					DUKAT
			Even then our fates were linked.

	Their eyes lock as they're both jolted by the 
	realization that the Prophets guided them to this 
	moment.


	A beat, then they both become aware of their 
	physical contact. There's an undercurrent of sexual 
	tension, and Dukat gently withdraws his hand, as if 
	realizing the inappropriateness of his touching so 
	august a person.

	He awkwardly turns his attention back to his plate. 
	Off Winn as she steals a glance at the mysterious
	man who's come into her life...

46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Sisko stands in the DARKENED room staring at the 
	MODEL of the house he intends to build on Bajor. 
	Without Kasidy, it suddenly seems a lonely place to 
	be.

	A long moment, then the door CHIMES. Sisko doesn't 
	seem to hear it. A beat, then the CHIME sounds 
	again.

					SISKO
			Yes.

	The door OPENS to reveal Quark, carrying a small, 
	wooden BOX.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Til Death... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT FOUR    48.

46   CONTINUED:

	The Ferengi quickly takes in the temperature of the 
	room, then warily approaches Sisko.

					QUARK 
			Sorry to interrupt, but I have 
			something for you.

	With a hint of trepidation, he holds up the box.

					QUARK
			The...
				(how to put it?) 
			-- item you ordered.

	Sisko had forgotten all about it, and whatever it is 
	has suddenly darkened his mood even more. He takes 
	the box from Quark, stares down at it.

	He slowly OPENS the box, revealing a DIAMOND WEDDING 
	RING. The thought that he'll never put it on 
	Kasidy's finger pierces Sisko's heart.

					QUARK
				(awkwardly) 
			Terellian diamonds aren't easy to 
			come by, especially with this war 
			on. Needless to say, it was non-
			refundable.

	Sisko nods vaguely.

					SISKO
			Thanks, Quark.

	Quark nods and starts toward the door. He hesitates 
	for a moment, then turns back to face Sisko.

					QUARK 
			Seems a shame to let something so 
			beautiful go to waste...

	With a meaningful look Sisko's way, Quark EXITS. 
	Sisko stares at the diamond for a long moment, then 
	CLOSES the box.

	He moves to the window and looks out at the stars, 
	trying to reconcile himself with the decision he's 
	made. Off his conflicted countenance...

	Worf paces alone, angry and very worried. A few

	Worf would like nothing better than to go at them 
	again, but his concern is for Ezri. The Breen EXIT 
	as he moves to her.

					WORF
			Ezri...

	Her face is covered with sweat. With her eyes 
	closed, she mumbles disjointed fragments of memories.

					EZRI
				(delirious) 
			Don't worry, Garak, I'll help you
			through this...

	Worf carefully picks her up and starts to carry her 
	over to the bench.

					EZRI
			I'm not just saying it because 
			I'm your sister, you have a

	He sets her down and wipes her brow. Suddenly --

51   HER EYES POP OPEN

	and she looks up at him.

			No more algae-paste.

	but HER EYES CLOSE and she sinks back into delirium.

					EZRI
			I'm not like you, Joran, I'm not
			a murderer...

					WORF
			Shh... it's all right.

	Ezri frowns, her eyes still closed.

					EZRI
			I was your wife... why won't you
			talk to me?

	Worf feels a stab of guilt and tenderness toward her.

					EZRI
				(smiles)
			I love you...

	Worf smiles down at her...

			Forgive me for disturbing you at

	At the mention of his name, a smile of anticipation 
	flashes across Winn's features. She sits up, her 
	unloosed HAIR falling about the shoulders of her 
	NIGHTGOWN.

					WINN
			I'll be right there.

	She stands and starts to pull on her ROBE.

	as Winn -- having taken a few minutes to get herself
	together -- ENTERS to see a bleary Solbor standing
	with a fully dressed Dukat. Solbor removed some of
	his outer vestments earlier in the night, leaving
	only the simple robes underneath.

					WINN
			Anjohl 

	Dukat reacts to the sight of her with her hair down --
	suddenly she seems more woman than Kai.

					DUKAT
				(struck by her appearance)
			Eminence...
				(then formal again)
			I hope I didn't wake you.

					WINN
			It's all right.
				(turning to him)
			You can go, Solbor.

	Solbor frowns slightly, then bows his head.

					SOLBOR
			As you wish.

	Solbor EXITS to the anteroom, leaving Winn and Dukat
	alone. 

					DUKAT
				(excited)
			Something wondrous has happened.

					DUKAT (Cont'd)
			I spoke with my brother in
			Relliketh. He told me that this
			morning, when he went to inspect
			the fields, he found moba saplings
			sprouting from the soil. But it's
			impossible. We only planted last
			week.
				(awed) 
			Tell me. Could it be a sign?

					WINN 
			Yes... a sign from the Prophets.

	Dukat seems overwhelmed, as if everything that's 
	happening to him is too much for this simple farmer
	to handle.

					WINN
			They're telling you that your 
			farm will thrive under your 
			brother's care. They don't want 
			you to go back to Relliketh. 
			They want you at my side.

	Moved by the Prophet's sign to them, Winn seizes
	Dukat's hand -- 

					DUKAT
			Then this is where I'll stay,
			eminence...

					WINN
				(giving her first

			Adami...

	A moment as their eyes lock.

					DUKAT
			Adami... what a beautiful name...

	Dukat reaches up as if to stroke her hair, but then 
	suddenly remembers himself and pulls his hand back.

					WINN

			It's all right... the Prophets 
			have brought us together...

	As she turns to go, the door OPENS and Sisko ENTERS.
	Their eyes lock across the room.

	A beat, then he starts toward her. She watches him

				(simply) 
			I made a mistake. I don't care

	Kasidy is still hurting from what happened, and she

				(melancholy) 
			Too bad Ezri and Worf couldn't be

56   ACROSS THE ROOM

	we see ODO and a quietly troubled Kira. Finally, 
	Odo says something.

					ODO 
			Usually when we come to events

	Kira snaps out of her reverie and musters a smile.

					ROSS 
			Kasidy, do you accept this man as

	Ross turns to Sisko.

					ROSS 
			Benjamin, do you accept this

			cherish above all others, until

					SISKO
			I do.

	Ross nods to Jake, who produces the rings. Kasidy 
	picks up a WEDDING BAND, takes Sisko's hand.

					ROSS 
			These rings symbolize your love

			Of course. In fact, I was just

					EZRI 
			For who?

			Look, I admit that I find him

			And he's an attractive man.

	Worf can't stand to hear another word --

					WORF
			You are in love with him!

					EZRI
				(adamant) 
			I am not!

					WORF 
			Then why do you dream about him?

	This one throws her back for a second. She can't

			You're the one who said dreams

	This is all the confirmation Worf needs. He turns
