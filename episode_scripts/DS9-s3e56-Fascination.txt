	FADE IN:

1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	JAKE is lying slumped on the couch, looking thoroughly 
	miserable.  He's spinning a fancy Bajoran earring around on 
	his finger, looking at it like it's the cause of all his 
	troubles.

	SISKO ENTERS looking relaxed and happy.

					SISKO
			I didn't expect to find you here.  I 
			thought you'd be down on the 
			Promenade, helping Mardah put up 
			decorations for the Bajoran Gratitude 
			Festival.

					JAKE
			That was the plan... but it turns 
			out I don't have much to be grateful 
			for.

	And with that he holds up the earring so that Sisko can see 
	it.

					SISKO
			Isn't that the earring you...

					JAKE
			Bought for Mardah.  Yeah, you want 
			it?  Maybe you could give it to Major 
			Kira for her next birthday or 
			something.

	Sisko sits down and puts on his concerned look, though at 
	least a part of him is relieved at what he's sure has 
	happened.

					SISKO
			All right, tell me all about it.

					JAKE
			Mardah's gone, Dad.  She got accepted 
			to the Science Academy on Regulus 
			Three.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - TEASER          2.

1    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			That's a good school.

					JAKE
			It's three hundred light years away.

					SISKO
			Jake, you're sixteen; take my word 
			for it, you'll survive.

	Jake looks unconvinced.

					SISKO
				(continues)
			Now you can either wallow here in 
			self-pity, or go off to the Gratitude 
			Festival and try to have a good time.

					JAKE
			Right now, I'd rather wallow.

					SISKO
			You're entitled.  But remember, you're 
			a sweet, good-looking guy...
				(smiles)
			Just like your old man.

DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/10/94 - TEASER            3.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO (Cont'd)
			Sooner or later, you'll find someone 
			else.  Who knows... maybe you'll 
			meet someone tonight at the Festival.

					JAKE
			Yeah, sure.

					SISKO
			Jake, the whole point of the festival 
			is to put your troubles behind you 
			and make a new start.

					JAKE
			I could use one.
				(makes his decision)
			Okay... I'll go.

	Jake says this with such solemnity that Sisko can't help but 
	smile.

					SISKO
				(claps Jake on the 
				shoulder)
			That's the spirit.

					JAKE
			But I'm not going to have any fun.

2    INT. REPLIMAT

	BASHIR and O'BRIEN are sitting together, drinking coffee.  
	The Replimat is empty, except for the two of them.

					BASHIR
			Nervous, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			What are you talking about?

					BASHIR
			That's your fifth cup of coffee in 
			twenty minutes.

					O'BRIEN
			I didn't know you were keeping track.

					BASHIR
			Ah, nervous and irascible.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - TEASER          4.

2    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Look if you hadn't seen your wife 
			and child for two months, you'd be 
			irascible, too.

					BASHIR
			Believe me, I'm looking forward to 
			Keiko and Molly's visit just as much 
			as you are.

					O'BRIEN
			I doubt that.

					BASHIR
			How many games of racquetball have 
			you and I played in the last two 
			months?

					O'BRIEN
			Oh, I don't know... fifteen, maybe 
			twenty.

					BASHIR
			Try seventy.  I've been keeping track 
			of that, too.  And you know what all 
			those games have proved to me?
				(a beat)
			That I'm a poor substitute for your 
			wife.

					O'BRIEN
			I could've told you that sixty games 
			ago.
				(a beat)
			The thing is... they're only going 
			to be here for two days.  That's 
			barely time to say hello.  And then 
			they're back to Bajor for four more 
			months.

					BASHIR
			Four months.  That's probably another 
			hundred and fifty games of 
			racquetball.  I don't know if my 
			elbow can take that kind of abuse.  
			Maybe you can convince her not to 
			leave.

					O'BRIEN
			Oh, no.  I can't do that.  I'm the 
			one who suggested she go on that 
			agrobiology expedition in the first 
			place.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - TEASER          5.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)
			We're just going to have to make the 
			best of the little time we have.
				(determined)
			Which means we can't afford to waste 
			a second of the next two days.  And 
			Julian, whatever you do, don't tell 
			her how miserable I've been without 
			her.  I don't want her feeling guilty.

					BASHIR
			My lips are sealed.
				(a beat)
			So when are they getting here?

					O'BRIEN
			Twenty minutes.
				(beat)
			I don't know about you, but I could 
			use another cup of coffee.

	O'Brien gets up to get another cup.  Bashir shakes his head.  
	He senses disaster approaching.

3    INT. PROMENADE

	The Promenade has been decorated with numerous brightly 
	colored banners.  Aside from a few Bajorans who are installing 
	a large circular brazier on a platform in front of the Bajoran 
	Temple, there's basically no one around.

	KIRA is watching the preparations when ODO approaches her.  

					KIRA
			Peldor Joi, Odo.

					ODO
			Peldor Joi to you, too.  It's hard 
			to believe the Promenade is this 
			empty at midday.

					KIRA
			Calm before the storm.  In a few 
			hours, this place will be packed 
			with Bajorans celebrating the 
			festival.

					ODO
			Actually, I was thinking I might 
			join you this year.

					KIRA
			Really?

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - TEASER          6.

3    CONTINUED:

					ODO
			I don't see why not.  My Bajoran 
			deputies never work during the 
			Gratitude Festival; why should I?
				(a beat)
			Besides, if I'm going to live here 
			with you humanoids, I may as well 
			immerse myself in your rituals.

					KIRA
			Who knows, you might even enjoy 
			yourself.

					ODO
			I suppose there is that possibility.

					KIRA
			Maybe we'll see each other later.

					ODO
			I'd like that... if you're not too 
			busy being the Presider of the 
			Festival.

					KIRA
			For you, I'll make time, Odo.

	Odo smiles, pleased.

					KIRA
			Just look for me.  I'll be with 
			Bareil.

	Odo tries to hide his disappointment.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - TEASER          7.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			Oh, I thought he'd be celebrating 
			the Festival on Bajor.

					KIRA
			So did I... but I'm glad I was wrong.  
			He's coming in on the next shuttle.

					ODO
			Then you'd better go.  It'll be here 
			soon.

	Kira realizes she's lost track of time.

					KIRA
			You're right.  I'll see you at the 
			festival.

	Odo nods as Kira races off.  Odo watches her go, the faintest 
	trace of regret on his face.

4    INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR

	Kira arrives at the airlock and finds O'Brien already waiting.

					KIRA
			Chief?

					O'BRIEN
				(surprised to see her)
			Major.

	O'Brien nods toward the airlock.

					O'BRIEN
				(explaining himself)
			Keiko.

					KIRA
			Bareil.

					O'BRIEN
			Good luck.

					KIRA
			You, too.

5    NEW ANGLE

	As the door opens and BAREIL EXITS.

            DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/10/94 - TEASER            8.

5    CONTINUED:

					BAREIL
			Nerys.

	He goes to Kira and they kiss.

					BAREIL
			I'm so glad to see you.

					KIRA
			I've missed you.

					BAREIL
			I've missed you, too.

6    CLOSE ON O'BRIEN

	As he watches Kira and Bareil's happy reunion.  This is 
	exactly what he was hoping for with Keiko.  Kira and Bareil 
	EXIT.

					KEIKO (O.S.)
			Miles?

	O'Brien turns and sees...

7    KEIKO AND MOLLY

	Emerge from the airlock.  He was so lost in thought, he missed 
	their arrival.

					O'BRIEN
				(excited)
			Keiko...
				(doesn't know what to 
				say)
			I'm... so glad to see you.

	He kisses her hello, but she barely returns it.

					KEIKO
			I'm glad to see you, too.  I've just 
			had the worst trip.

					O'BRIEN
			Oh... I'm sorry to hear that.  But 
			now that you're here, everything's 
			going to be great.

	Keiko nods, but doesn't seem to be buying it.  Trying not to 
	be discouraged, O'Brien turns his attention to Molly.  He 
	squats to talk face to face with his daughter.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - TEASER          9.

7    CONTINUED:

					MOLLY
			Hi.

					O'BRIEN
			Hello, sweetie.  You ready to have a 
			good time with Daddy?

					MOLLY
			No.

					O'BRIEN
			Why not?

					MOLLY
			I don't feel so good.

					O'BRIEN
			Tell Daddy what's wrong.

	But from the look on Molly's face, it seems like Molly is 
	about to show Daddy what's wrong.

8    CLOSE ON O'BRIEN'S FACE

	As his daughter, off-screen, vomits into his lap.  Off his 
	expression...

9    NEW ANGLE

	As we hear a familiar voice...

					LWAXANA (O.S.)
			Oh, you poor dear.

	LWAXANA TROI steps out of the airlock, dressed to the hilt.

					LWAXANA
			I never should've given you all that 
			candy.

10   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN

	And as he realizes things aren't working out exactly as he 
	planned, we...

									FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

11   INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	Odo is talking to a Starfleet Security Officer, finishing up 
	briefing him on station security.

					ODO
			I usually make it a point to stop by 
			Quark's three or four times a day at 
			random intervals... just to let him 
			know that I'm thinking about him.  
			But seeing that today's a holiday, 
			and he'll be busier than usual... I 
			suggest you station a man there full 
			time.

	The Security Officer nods.

					ODO
			I think that about covers it.  If 
			you need me, I'll be on the 
			Promenade...

					LWAXANA (O.S.)
			But don't call unless it's an 
			emergency.

12   NEW ANGLE

	As Odo and the Security Officer turn to find Lwaxana standing 
	in the doorway.

					LWAXANA
			The constable will be... occupied.

					ODO
				(surprised)
			Madame Ambassador...

					LWAXANA
			Do we have to be so formal?

	She reaches over and envelopes him in a hug.  Odo is 
	mortified.  Lwaxana looks over at the Security Officer, who 
	is surprised to say the least.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/18/94 - ACT ONE        11.

12   CONTINUED:

					LWAXANA
			Didn't they teach you any manners at 
			Starfleet Academy?

	The Security Officer looks to Odo who nods.

					ODO
			Come back in five minutes.

	The Security Officer starts to leave.

					LWAXANA
				(calling after him)
			Make that half an hour.

	The Security Officer EXITS.  Lwaxana is still holding on to 
	Odo, who slips out of her grasp.

					ODO
				(almost afraid to ask)
			So... what brings you to the station.

					LWAXANA
			Officially I'm here as the Betazoid 
			representative to the Gratitude 
			Festival.  But the truth is, I came 
			to see you.  You poor sweet tortured 
			man.

					ODO
			Excuse me?

					LWAXANA
			I know the torment you must be going 
			through.

	Odo doesn't get it.  He has no idea what she's talking about.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT ONE        12.

12   CONTINUED:	(2)

					LWAXANA
			To spend your whole life searching 
			for your people only to discover 
			that they're the leaders of that 
			awful Dominion.

					ODO
			You heard about that?

					LWAXANA
			When you travel as much as I do, you 
			make friends everywhere.  I like to 
			think of Admiral Necheyev as the 
			sister I never had.
				(sincere)
			Don't worry, Odo.  I'm here to help 
			you.

					ODO
			What kind of help do you mean?

					LWAXANA
			A sympathetic ear.  A shoulder to 
			cry on.
				(moves closer to him)
			A lap to melt in.

	Odo backs away a little.

					ODO
			That's very considerate of you, but 
			unnecessary.  My people are who they 
			are, and I am who I am... And I've 
			learned to accept that.

					LWAXANA
			You brave soul.  Why don't we go 
			someplace quiet so you can tell me 
			all about it?

					ODO
			Actually, I was planning to go to 
			the opening of the Gratitude Festival 
			this afternoon.

					LWAXANA
			Even better.  First, a little fun 
			and relaxation, and then we can delve 
			into the depths of your pain.
				(a beat)
			I'll freshen up, then I'll meet you 
			outside the Bajoran Temple for the 
			Presider's opening address.

           DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/10/94 - ACT ONE           13.

12   CONTINUED:	(3)

	She reaches over and caresses his face.

					LWAXANA
			I promise you, Odo, it's going to be 
			all right.  You're not alone anymore.

	Lwaxana sweeps out of the room.  Odo watches her go.  He'd 
	been looking forward to the Gratitude Festival, but now Kira 
	is off with Bareil and he's faced with Hurricane Lwaxana.

13   INT. TURBOLIFT

	Lwaxana ENTERS the turbolift.

					LWAXANA
			Level Twenty-three, Section Eight.

	As the turbolift starts to move, Lwaxana experiences a brief, 
	stabbing headache.  She holds her temples for a second, but 
	it passes as quickly as it came.  But even though the pain 
	is gone, there's a moment of panic and worry on Lwaxana's 
	face, as if she's had these headaches before.

14   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	Kira and Bareil are locked in a warm, friendly, passionate 
	embrace.

					KIRA
			We need to see each other more often.

					BAREIL
			I know.  I wish we both weren't so 
			busy.  I never expected Kai Winn to 
			make me one of her principal advisors.

					KIRA
			I think she just asks your advice so 
			she can do the opposite of whatever 
			you recommend.

					BAREIL
			I know you don't like Winn, Nerys... 
			but the office has changed her.  The 
			Prophets chose well.

	But this isn't really what Bareil wants to talk about.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT ONE        14.

14   CONTINUED:

					BAREIL
				(continuing)
			So why not leave spiritual matters 
			in their capable hands and concentrate 
			on enjoying ourselves?

	They kiss, but Kira breaks it off suddenly.

					KIRA
			I have to go.

					BAREIL
			But the festival won't be starting 
			for another hour.

					KIRA
			I have to set up the Renewal scrolls 
			along the Promenade.  It won't take 
			long.  Jadzia's promised to help.

					BAREIL
			Of course... Jadzia.
				(a beat)
			You know, I've never understood how 
			the two of you could be such good 
			friends.  She's... so unpredictable 
			and you're so...

					KIRA
				(smiles)
			Predictable?

					BAREIL
			I didn't mean it like that.
				(a beat)
			It's just that she gets to spend so 
			much more time with you than I do.

					KIRA
			Jadzia and I have done this for the 
			past two years.  It's becoming kind 
			of a tradition.

					BAREIL
			I was hoping we could start some

	Bareil smiles.  He knows when he's beaten.

15   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS

	Keiko comes out of Molly's bedroom and joins O'Brien.  She 
	looks exhausted.

					O'BRIEN
			She asleep?

					KEIKO
				(nods)
			It looks like the medicine Doctor 
			Bashir prescribed is working...

					O'BRIEN
			That's a relief.

	Keiko looks at her bags, which are still sitting in the middle 
	of the room.  She goes to open them, then thinks better of 
	it and just sits down.

					O'BRIEN
			Rough trip, huh?

					KEIKO
			It was a disaster.

	O'Brien sits down next to her on the couch and places his 
	hand on hers.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm glad you're home.

	She squeezes his hand.

					KEIKO
			Me, too.

	There's an awkward beat between them.  O'Brien isn't really 
	sure what to do next.

					O'BRIEN
			We should get ready for the festival.  
			The babysitter will be here any 
			minute.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE        16.

15   CONTINUED:

					KEIKO
				(unenthused)
			The festival.

					O'BRIEN
				(quick backpedal)
			On the other hand, we could spend 
			the day locked away in our quarters.

	He moves closer to her on the couch and gives her a come-
	hither look.  Keiko considers it for a beat, but the fact 
	is, she's just not in the mood.

					KEIKO
				(a tired smile)
			What I really want to do is sleep.

					O'BRIEN
				(his feelings hurt)
			Then maybe you should.

					KEIKO
			Miles, I didn't say I was going to 
			sleep; I just meant I could use some.

					O'BRIEN
			That's okay.  I mean... if you need 
			to sleep, go ahead.  I'll understand.

					KEIKO
			No, you won't.  You'll be disappointed 
			and you'll start brooding and stomping 
			around like an Andorian Bull.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, stay or go, it's all the same 
			to me... just tell me what you want 
			to do and we'll do it.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE        17.

15   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KEIKO
			Miles, I've been making decisions 
			all day.  You decide.

					O'BRIEN
				(calming down)
			Okay, we'll go to the festival.
				(hedging)
			But we don't have to go right away.  
			You can take some time to relax, and 
			change into something nice.

					KEIKO
			Nice?

					O'BRIEN
			You know... like your red dress.

					KEIKO
			My red dress?  Really?

					O'BRIEN
			Something wrong with the red dress?

					KEIKO
			If it'll make you happy, I'll wear 
			the red dress.

					O'BRIEN
			Forget the red dress.  Wear whatever 
			you want.


         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE        18.

15   CONTINUED:	(3)

					KEIKO
			Look, let's just try to enjoy the 
			next two days.
				(a beat)
			I'll change into something nice and 
			we'll go to the festival.  Okay?

					O'BRIEN
			Fine.

	Keiko leaves to go change.  O'Brien watches her go.  He's 
	not enjoying himself.

					O'BRIEN
				(to himself, ironic)
			I can hardly wait.

16   INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE THE BAJORAN SHRINE

	A large crowd, mostly Bajoran, has gathered in front of the 
	platform where Kira stands next to the unlit brazier.  Many 
	people in the crowd are carrying paper scrolls and there are 
	baskets of additional scrolls on either side of the platform.  
	Among the crowd are Sisko, DAX, Bashir, Jake, Odo and Bareil.

	Keiko and O'Brien are standing off to one side, not 
	participating as actively as the others.  Keiko is wearing 
	one of her casual outfits (not the red dress).  She looks 
	tired and O'Brien looks like a man whose balloon has just 
	popped.

	Kira holds up a flask of oil and intones an ancient 
	ritualistic Bajoran blessing.

					KIRA
			Tesra Peldor impatri bren.  Bentel 
			vetan ullon sten.

	Kira holds the flask high and tilts it slowly.  A stream of 
	burning liquid pours from the spout into the metal brazier, 
	setting the contents of the brazier alight.

	The crowd breaks into cheers.  Lwaxana comes up to Odo and 
	smiles as if to say, "Here I am."  Odo, who has been watching 
	Kira intently, sighs and tries to smile in return.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT ONE        19.

16   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			And now, I have the honor of placing 
			the first Renewal Scroll into the 
			fire.
				(formal benediction)
			As the scrolls burn, may all our 
			troubles turn to ashes with them.

	She puts her scroll on the fire.  The crowd cheers again, 
	even louder.

					KIRA
				(smiles)
			Now, for the next twenty-six hours, 
			I expect you all to enjoy yourselves.  
			I know I will.

	Dax looks at Bareil and gives him a knowing smile.  Bareil 
	looks away, somewhat embarrassed.

					KIRA
			May the Prophets walk with us.

	Some of the members of the crowd file forward and place their 
	scrolls on the fire.  Everyone is happy and full of good 
	cheer.

17   CLOSE ON LWAXANA

	As she gets hit by another quick headache.  She rubs her 
	brow.  Just then, in the background...

18   CLOSE ON BAREIL

	Bareil also rubs his temples as if in reaction to Lwaxana's 
	headache.

19   CLOSE ON JAKE

	Grimacing as he rubs his head.  Sisko, who is standing next 
	to him, notices.

           DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/10/94 - ACT ONE           20.

19   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Jake, you okay?

	Jake's headache passes as quickly as it came.

					JAKE
			Just felt a little funny there for a 
			second.

					SISKO
			You sure you're all right?

	Something catches Jake's eye.  It's Kira stepping down from 
	the platform to join Bareil.  Jake smiles.

					JAKE
			Yeah, Dad.  Never felt better.

	And as Jake looks at Kira with new appreciation, we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

20   INT. PROMENADE

	Kira and Bareil are walking through a crowd of Bajoran 
	celebrants.  The mood on the Promenade is boisterous.  
	Latecomers are taking scrolls from the baskets to write down 
	their problems.  The kiosk and Quark's are doing brisk 
	business selling jumja sticks and other treats and there are 
	tumblers and acrobats performing for the crowd.

	Bareil seems to be looking around the Promenade as if 
	surreptitiously searching for someone.

					KIRA
			Bareil?

	She starts looking around too, wondering what he's searching 
	for.

					KIRA
			What are you looking for?

					BAREIL
				(distracted)
			Nothing.  Just looking.

	But he continues to scan the crowd.  Before Kira can dig 
	deeper, her attention is drawn to Jake... who appears out of 
	the crowd, carrying two jumja sticks, one of which he presents 
	to her with a goofy grin.

					JAKE
			Peldor Joi.

	Kira smiles and accepts it.

					KIRA
			Jake, how thoughtful.  Thank you.

					JAKE
				(shy)
			Uh... I know you're busy, but can 
			I... talk to you for a second?

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/17/94 - ACT TWO        22.

20   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Sure.

	Jake glances uncomfortably at Bareil.

					JAKE
			In private?  It's kind of personal.

	Kira looks over to Bareil to see if he doesn't mind.

					KIRA
			I'll be right back.

	Jake and Kira move off, and as soon as they're gone, Bareil 
	wanders away, still searching through the crowd.

21   NEW ANGLE

	On Jake and Kira, who haven't noticed Bareil's departure.

					KIRA
			So what can I do for you, Jake?

					JAKE
			I need some advice.  You see, there's 
			this older woman... and I think we're 
			perfect for each other.  But...

					KIRA
				(finishing for him)
			But she doesn't.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/17/94 - ACT TWO        22.

21   CONTINUED:

					JAKE
			I'm not sure what she thinks.

					KIRA
			Well, my advice is to tell Mardah how 
			you feel.  That way you'll know--

					JAKE
				(smiling, almost proud)
			Mardah and I broke up.

					KIRA
			You broke up?  Then who... ?

					JAKE
			You.

					KIRA
				(incredulous)
			Me?

					JAKE
				(solemn)
			I love you, Nerys.
				(lighter)
			Want to go out with me?

	Kira looks at Jake.  She can't believe what she's hearing.

22   INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PROMENADE

	Dax is sitting by the burning brazier, reading Morn's scroll 
	as Morn looks on.  The scroll is covered front and back with 
	a blotchy alien script.

					DAX
			Morn, I can't believe a handsome, 
			fun-loving guy like you could have 
			so many problems.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT TWO        24.

22   CONTINUED:

					DAX
				(gives back the scroll)
			My advice is to burn this as quickly 
			as possible and don't look back.

	Morn nods, that's exactly what he was thinking.  He tosses 
	the scroll into the fire with glee and strolls off.

					BAREIL (O.S.)
			Sage advice.

	Dax turns and sees Bareil approaching her.

					DAX
				(a greeting)
			Vedek Bareil, it's good to see you.
				(a beat)
			If you're looking for Nerys, she's 
			not here.

					BAREIL
			Actually, I was looking for you.
				(sits down beside her)
			I owe you an apology.

					DAX
			For what?

					BAREIL
			I have to confess, I've always been 
			a little jealous of your friendship 
			with Nerys.

					DAX
			That's understandable.  When you 
			come to the station, you want her 
			all to yourself.

					BAREIL
			You have such a wise, generous spirit.  
			I only wish I had a friend like you.

					DAX
			I think of you as a friend.

					BAREIL
			Do you mean that?

					DAX
			Of course.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT TWO        25.

22   CONTINUED:	(2)

					BAREIL
			I'm glad.  Because I was hoping that 
			you and I could get to know each 
			other better.

	Bareil moves a little closer to Dax and places his hand on 
	her knee.

					BAREIL
				(continues)
			A lot better.

	Dax looks down at Bareil's hand, then up at him.  And off 
	his look of yearning...

									CUT TO:

23   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	A trio of Bajoran musicians are playing a spritely tune.  
	Some people are standing by listening attentively, others 
	are just walking by and smiling at the music.

	Off to one side, Odo and Lwaxana are watching the performance.  
	Odo is swaying slightly with the music.

					LWAXANA
			I love Bajoran music.  It's so 
			intelligent, so vital... It reminds 
			me of you.

	She reaches out and grabs his hands.

					LWAXANA
			Dance with me.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/18/94 - ACT TWO        26.

23   CONTINUED:

	She begins dancing, leading Odo by the hands.  But Odo 
	refuses to go along.  He tries to remain firmly planted in 
	one place.

					ODO
			I'm sorry.  I don't dance.

					LWAXANA
			Nonsense.  I saw you moving to the 
			music.

					ODO
			That wasn't dancing.  That was... 
			swaying.

					LWAXANA
			Then sway with me, Odo.

	She tries to take him in her arms but Odo avoids her.

					ODO
			I just remembered, I'm needed in 
			Security.

					LWAXANA
			I'll come with you.

           DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/25/94 - ACT TWO           27.

23   CONTINUED:	(2)

	She takes his arm and they begin to walk off.

24   NEW ANGLE

	As Dax approaches.

					ODO
			Hello, Lieutenant.  Having a good 
			time?

					DAX
			No.

	Odo nods in empathy and sympathy.  As Dax walks away, Lwaxana 
	rubs her temples absentmindedly.  Dax does the same, but as 
	with Bareil and Jake, the headache passes as fast as it came.

25   INT. QUARK'S

	Quark is standing by the window to the Promenade hawking 
	souvenirs.  He's wearing a Bajoran earring and shouting to 
	be heard over the crowd.

					QUARK
			That's right... genuine latinum-plated 
			Renewal Scroll inscription pens.  
			Blessed by Vedek Redab himself... 
			shortly before he passed away.  Each 
			pen is engraved with the words "Deep 
			Space Nine's Third Annual Gratitude 
			Festival," today's date, and a lovely 
			portrait of the station by Ermat 
			Zimm.
				(louder)
			So get them while you can, they're 
			sure to become collector's items.

	We pan across a crowded Quark's.  All the gambling tables 
	have been removed and the stage is being used by a juggler.  
	People are having a genuinely good time.

	We pan up to...

26   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL

	Where O'Brien and Keiko are seated at a table.  They're quiet 
	and a little uncomfortable and tentative now that they're 
	alone together.

         DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT TWO        28.

26   CONTINUED:

	This is a moment that they've been waiting for a long 
	time, and now that it's here, neither one of them knows quiet 
	what to do with it.

	There's a plate of Bajoran hasparat on the table.  Keiko is 
	picking at it to give herself something to do, but O'Brien's 
	not eating at all.

					O'BRIEN
				(trying to be upbeat)
			So what do you say we go walk around 
			the Promenade for a little while?

					KEIKO
			I'd rather stay here.
				(a beat)
			I never thought I'd say this, but I 
			kind of miss Quark's... the noise, 
			the excitement... our table.

	O'Brien smiles for the first time.  This is more like it.

					O'BRIEN
				(proudly)
			You know, I haven't sat here since 
			you've been gone.

					KEIKO
				(happy)
			That's so sweet.

	There's a brief awkward silence.

					O'BRIEN
			So how's the survey going?

					KEIKO
			The terrain's rougher than we 
			expected, and the ecosystem's a lot 
			more diverse than it looked from the 
			orbital scans.  All in all, it's 
			been pretty grueling.

	This is what O'Brien was hoping to hear.

26   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			Really?

					KEIKO
			Don't get me wrong, I'm having a 
			wonderful time.

					O'BRIEN
				(deflated)
			Oh... that's good.

	Keiko wasn't looking to bring this up, but it seems like an 
	opportune time.

					KEIKO
			There is one problem I have to talk 
			to you about.
				(off his reaction)
			The project's taking longer than we 
			hoped.

					O'BRIEN
			What do you mean... longer?

					KEIKO
			You have to understand, Miles, every 
			valley has an entirely different 
			ecosystem.  There's a lot of work to 
			be done.

					O'BRIEN
				(wants the bottom 
				line)
			How much longer is it going to take?

					KEIKO
			I'm not sure.

					O'BRIEN
				(a little agitated)
			Take a guess.  An extra couple of 
			days... a week or two?

					KEIKO
				(not happy)
			More like two or three months.

					O'BRIEN
			You're telling me you're going to be 
			on Bajor for another seven months.

					KEIKO
			It's either that or tell them to 
			find another botanist.

26   CONTINUED:	(3)

					O'BRIEN
			Maybe that's something worth

	Keiko is shocked and disappointed by her husband's attitude.

					KEIKO
			Are you asking me to resign?

					O'BRIEN
			No... But another seven months?

					KEIKO
			I don't like this any more than you 
			do.

					O'BRIEN
				(not buying it)
			You just said you're enjoying 
			yourself.

					KEIKO
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, I'm sorry.  I suppose you'd be 
			happier if I was miserable?

					O'BRIEN
			I didn't say that.

					KEIKO
			Sebarr was right.  I never should've 
			mentioned it.

					O'BRIEN
			And who's Sebarr?

					KEIKO
			He's one of the zoologists I'm working 
			with.  He warned me not to talk to 
			you about this until after the 
			Gratitude Festival..

					O'BRIEN
			Who's he to be giving you advice?

					KEIKO
			He's a friend.

					O'BRIEN
			A friend?  I thought you were down 
			there working.

					KEIKO
			We are working.

26   CONTINUED:	(4)

					O'BRIEN
			With time out for intimate little

			else have you told him about us?

					KEIKO
			Miles, you're acting like a child.  
			What do you want me to say?

					O'BRIEN
				(finally spits it out)
			I want you to say you're not going 
			back... that you're going to stay 
			here with me.

					KEIKO
			Right now, Miles, I don't even want 
			to sit at the same table with you.

	Keiko gets up and leaves.  O'Brien loses his temper.

					O'BRIEN
				(shouting after her)
			Fine.  Leave.  Go on back to Bajor... 
			and your plants... and Sebarr.

	But she's already gone.

					O'BRIEN
				(to himself)
			See if I care.

	O'Brien slumps back down in his chair, the most miserable 
	man in the galaxy.  And we...

27   INT. PROMENADE

	Jake is cutting through the crowd, a man on a mission.  His 
	eyes dart around as he searches for the love of his life... 
	Kira Nerys.

	Suddenly, someone appears out of the crowd and grabs hold of 
	Jake's arm.  It's Sisko.

					SISKO
			Whoa, slow down.

	Jake stops but his mind is still on his goal.

					JAKE
			Hi, Dad.

					SISKO
			I've been looking all over for you.  
			In case you've forgotten, we're 
			hosting a Gratitude Dinner tonight 
			in the wardroom, and I could use 
			your help getting ready.

					JAKE
			I'm kind of busy right now, Dad.  I 
			have to find someone.

					SISKO
				(that's what he was 
				afraid of)
			Major Kira?

					JAKE
			How did you know?

					SISKO
			I just spoke to her.

					JAKE
			Really?  Where is she?

	He starts looking around.

					SISKO
			Just hold on.

					JAKE
			But I need to talk to her.  You know, 
			you were right about me meeting 
			someone at the Festival.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/17/94 - ACT THREE       33.

27   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I didn't mean Major Kira.

					JAKE
			You like her, don't you?

					SISKO
			Of course I like her.

					JAKE
			So do I.

					SISKO
			Jake, what you're feeling... it's 
			just a crush.

	They sit down on the Promenade couch.

					SISKO
			Look, right now... you're confused, 
			hurt, vulnerable.  You miss Mardah...

					JAKE
			Mardah was a mistake, Dad.  She was 
			too young, too immature for me.  
			Major Kira is a woman.

					SISKO
			Major Kira is in love with Vedek 
			Bareil.

					JAKE
			It won't last.  He's always on Bajor.  
			She needs someone who can be with 
			her all the time.  Like me.

					JAKE
			I appreciate that, Dad... but this 
			is between Nerys and me.

			Don't worry.  Everything's going to

	Jake walks away.  Sisko wants to stop him, but realizes that 
	some lessons have to be learned the hard way.

28   INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE QUARK'S

	Odo and Lwaxana are walking away from the window where one 
	of Quark's Ferengi waiters has taken his place hawking the 
	inscription pens.

	Odo is holding one of the pens and looking at it with a marked 
	lack of enthusiasm.

					ODO
			I really can't accept this.

					LWAXANA
			But I want you to have it.  It's my 
			gift to you.

					ODO
			That's very thoughtful... but I have 
			nothing to give you in return.

					LWAXANA
			Being with you is the only present I 
			need.
				(snuggles up to him)
			Now let's go write our Renewal 
			Scrolls.

	Odo sighs, beaten again.  The two of them walk off down the 
	Promenade.

29   INT. QUARK'S

	A miserable O'Brien is sitting at the bar, rubbing his 
	temples.  Quark comes over to serve him.

	He offers O'Brien a souvenir pen.  O'Brien takes it and looks 
	at it.

					O'BRIEN
			What for?

					QUARK
			To write down your problems on a 
			Renewal Scroll.

					O'BRIEN
			There isn't a scroll long enough to 
			hold all my problems.

					QUARK
			Really?  I thought you could sum

			Keiko.

	O'Brien glares at Quark.

					QUARK
			Tell me I'm wrong.
				(off O'Brien's reaction)
			If you ask me, it's your own fault.  
			You never should've let her go to 
			Bajor in the first place.

					QUARK
			That would've been a good start.

			You humans never learn.  You let 
			your women go out in public, hold 
			jobs, wear clothing, and you wonder 
			why your marriages fall apart.

					O'BRIEN
			That's your solution, Quark?  Treat 
			women like property?

					QUARK
			Criticize it all you want.  But on 
			the Ferengi homeworld, husbands and 
			wives never argue.  There's no 
			divorce, no broken homes... nothing 
			but peaceful conjugal bliss.

					O'BRIEN
			If Ferengi marriages are so wonderful, 
			how come you're still single?

					QUARK
				(defensive)
			I haven't met the right woman yet.

					O'BRIEN
				(miserable)
			Well I have.  And she just walked 
			out that door.

					QUARK
			And out of your life.

	O'Brien realizes that his marriage has reached a critical 
	point.  He stands up.

					O'BRIEN
			Not if I can help it.

	O'Brien EXITS, determined to set things right.

30   INT. CORRIDOR

	This is a corridor just off the Promenade.  In the distance, 
	we can hear the sounds of the ongoing celebration.

	Kira is walking along the corridor.  She meets up with Bareil, 
	hurrying the other way.

					KIRA
			Bareil.  I was wondering where you 
			disappeared to.

	She goes to kiss him, but he turns his head a little so it 
	becomes more of a peck on the cheek.

					KIRA
				(playful)
			Come on.  You can do better than 
			that.

					BAREIL
				(trying to hide his 
				discomfort)
			Someone might see us.

					KIRA
			We're the only people here.  Everyone 
			else is on the Promenade.

	Kira senses something's wrong, but tries to push past it.

					KIRA
			We have two hours until we're supposed 
			to join Commander Sisko for dinner.  
			That gives us some time to be alone 
			together.

					BAREIL
			I can't.

					KIRA
			Why?

					BAREIL
			I have to find Jadzia.

					KIRA
			Jadzia?  Is something wrong?

					BAREIL
			Not at all.
				(a beat)
			Have you seen her?

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT THREE       39.

30   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			She's probably on the Promenade.

					BAREIL
			She wasn't there the last time I 
			looked.

					KIRA
			Why is it so important for you to 
			talk to Jadzia?

					BAREIL
			I'll explain everything later.

	He starts to move away, then turns back toward Kira.

					BAREIL
			Thank you, Nerys.

					KIRA
			For what?

	He pats her on the shoulder.

					BAREIL
			For being such a good friend.

	Bareil walks away, leaving behind a very confused and worried 
	Kira.

					KIRA
			Friend?

31   INT. WARDROOM

	Sisko ENTERS to find Dax setting up the room for a buffet 
	dinner.

					SISKO
				(surprised to see her)
			Dax, what are you doing here?

					DAX
			I thought you might need some help 
			getting ready for the party.

	He goes to give her a hand.

					SISKO
			Thanks, but that's really not 
			necessary.  Wouldn't you rather be 
			celebrating on the Promenade?

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT THREE       40.


31   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			No thank you.  I don't want to run 
			into Vedek Bareil.

					SISKO
			Is there a problem between you two?

					DAX
			He can't keep his hands off me.

					SISKO
			That doesn't sound like Vedek Bareil.

					DAX
			I couldn't believe it either, but 
			the man wouldn't leave me alone.  
			He's probably still out there looking 
			for me.

					SISKO
				(troubled)
			Have you told Kira?

					DAX
			I don't know how.  It's going to 
			break her heart.

	Sisko sits down.  This is all very unsettling to him.

					SISKO
			Someone has to tell her.
				(a beat)
			You want me to do it?

	Dax sits down next to Sisko.

					DAX
			Would you?

					SISKO
			If you think that's the best way to 
			handle it.

					DAX
			I really appreciate this, Benjamin.  
			I mean, the whole thing's ridiculous.  
			How could I be interested in Bareil?

          DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/10/94 - ACT THREE          41.

31   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Suddenly, she leans over and snuggles her head against 
	his shoulder.

					DAX
			We both know it's always been you.

	And as Sisko reacts to this sudden and unexpected display of 
	affection, we...

									FADE OUT.

32   INT. WARDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Sisko looks at Dax, who's seems incredibly content with her 
	head on his shoulder.

					SISKO
			Dax?

					DAX
				(happy as a clam)
			Mmm?

					SISKO
			What are you doing?

					DAX
			Making myself comfortable.

	She snuggles closer and puts her arms around his waist.

					DAX
			Have I ever told you that you smell 
			wonderful?

	Sisko gently pushes her away and smiles.  He looks at her 
	like he's seen through her joke.

					SISKO
			I have to admit, old man, you had me 
			going there for a minute.

					DAX
			Benjamin, you can stop acting so 
			coy.  No one's around.

	She shifts her position, spinning around and laying her head 
	in Sisko's lap.

					DAX
			I've got an idea.  Why don't you 
			cancel the party?  That way we can 
			spend the evening alone together.

	She takes Sisko's hand and cups it to her face.

					DAX
			What do you say?

	With his free hand, Sisko taps his combadge.

           DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - 10/10/94 - ACT FOUR          43.

32   CONTINUED:

					SISKO

			Sisko to Bashir.

					BASHIR'S COM VOICE
			Go ahead, Commander.

					SISKO
			Meet me in the Infirmary immediately.

					BASHIR'S COM VOICE
			I'll be right there.

	Dax looks up at Sisko.

					DAX
			Can I come, too?

	Sisko studies Dax for a beat.

					SISKO
			Absolutely.

33   INT. SURGERY

	Dax is sitting on one of the examination tables, looking at 
	Sisko and Bashir.  Bashir is reading test results from a 
	monitor.

					BASHIR
				(off readouts)
			Her vital signs are normal... Brain 
			activity's normal... no sign of 
			infection or intoxication of any 
			kind...
				(turns to Sisko)
			She's the picture of health.

	Dax jumps off the table and comes to join them.

					DAX
				(reprovingly)
			I told you.

					SISKO
			Then why did you put your head in my 
			lap?

					DAX
				(smiling mischievously)
			Julian, you should've seen his face.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FOUR        44.

33   CONTINUED:

					DAX
				(to Sisko)
			Admit it, you were this far from 
			total panic.

					BASHIR
				(smiles, to Sisko)
			I think we've both been victims of a 
			practical joke.

					DAX
			At least someone around here has a 
			sense of humor.
				(to Sisko)
			Remember the time Curzon convinced 
			you that the Romulan ambassador's 
			wife was in love with you?
				(grins)
			This was even better.
				(to Bashir)
			See you at the party, Julian.

	Dax puts her arm through Sisko's and they EXIT.  Bashir smiles 
	and shakes his head.

34   INT. PROMENADE

	The crowd has thinned out as people have begun going back to 
	their quarters to prepare for private Gratitude Dinners.  
	Dax and Sisko walk out onto the Promenade, arm in arm.

					DAX
			I've never been so embarrassed in my 
			life... making me sit through all 
			those tests...

	Sisko smiles.  Though he was worried, the way things worked 
	out, he actually feels like he may have gotten the better of 
	her.

					SISKO
			It's your own fault, Dax.  You took 
			this one too far.

					DAX
			You know, if I didn't love you so 
			much, I'd be very angry with you 
			right now.

	She leans forward and kisses Sisko on the ear.  Sisko reacts 
	in confusion.

37   INT. REPLIMAT

	Close on Kira, sitting by herself at a table, looking lonely 
	and depressed.  Suddenly someone drops down into the seat 
	next to her.  It's Jake.

					JAKE
			You look like you could use some 
			cheering up.

	Kira, who's still hurting over Bareil's behavior, is really 
	in no mood for Jake right now.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/17/94 - ACT FOUR        46.

37   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Do me a favor, Jake.

					JAKE
			Anything.

					KIRA
				(stern)
			Leave me alone.

	Kira gets up and walks away.  Jake sits there watching her, 
	a lovesick smile on his face.  He turns to Morn, who is 
	sitting at the next table.

					JAKE
			Isn't she beautiful?

	Morn nods.

38   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS

	O'Brien ENTERS to find Molly, in nightclothes, playing with 
	her stuffed Targ.

					O'BRIEN
			Hi, sweetie.  Feeling better?

					MOLLY
			Lots better.

					O'BRIEN
			Ah, that's what I wanted to hear.

	He hugs and kisses his daughter.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FOUR        47.

38   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Where's Mommy?

					MOLLY
			In her room.  She's sad.

					O'BRIEN
			Well why don't you play with Piggy 
			in your room for a while and we'll 
			see if Daddy can cheer Mommy up?

					MOLLY
			Okay.

	Molly takes her stuffed animal and walks away.

39   NEW ANGLE

	O'Brien walks over to the closed door of his and Keiko's 
	room.  He starts talking through the door.

					O'BRIEN
			Keiko?  It's me.  Can I come in?

					KEIKO (O.S.)
				(through the door)
			Not now, Miles.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, you're right.  I'm an idiot, 
			sometimes.  When I don't get my way, 
			I can be selfish and childish and 
			pigheaded.  I know I've said some 
			pretty stupid things today.  I wish 
			I could take them back.
				(really hurting)
			But even if it's too late for that, 
			there's one thing you should know... 
			I love you, Keiko.  I always have, 
			and I always will.
				(a beat)
			Anyway, I just want you to know I've 
			left a letter of resignation on 
			Commander Sisko's desk.  I'm ready 
			to move down to Bajor tomorrow, if 
			you'll have me.  And after that if 
			you want us to move back to Earth 
			that's okay too.  I'll do whatever 
			it takes... I just don't want to 
			lose you.
				(a beat)
			Honey, did you hear what I said?

					KEIKO (O.S.)
				(through the door)
			Yes.

					O'BRIEN
				(hopeful)
			And... ?

	There's a long silence, then...

					KEIKO (O.S.)
				(through the door)
			And I need time to think.  Why don't 
			you go to Commander Sisko's party?  
			We can talk when you get back.

	O'Brien looks crushed, but knows better than to push his 
	luck.

					O'BRIEN
			If that's what you want.

	There's no answer.

41   INT. CORRIDOR

	This is the same corridor Bareil and Kira were in previously.  
	Kira is walking down the corridor when she runs into Odo, 
	Lwaxana and Bashir going the other way.

					ODO
			Major.  Aren't you headed in the 
			wrong direction?

					BASHIR
				(off her look)
			Commander Sisko's party?

					KIRA
			I'm not going.

					LWAXANA
			Why ever not?

					KIRA
			Because Bareil will be there.

					ODO
			I thought the two of you were very 
			happy together.

					KIRA
			So did I.  But it turns out he'd 
			rather be with Dax than me.  And to 
			make things worse, Jake Sisko's 
			chasing me all over the station, 
			professing his undying love.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FOUR        50.

41   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			That's strange.  A little while ago, 
			Jadzia had Commander Sisko convinced 
			that she was in love with him.  He 
			even had me examine her to make sure 
			she was all right.  Apparently it 
			was only a joke.

					KIRA
			Are you sure?  A lot of people are 
			acting strange today.

					BASHIR
			Maybe I'd better take another look 
			at Jadzia's test results.
				(to Odo)
			Constable, could you tell Commander 
			Sisko I'll be a little late?

	Odo nods and he and Lwaxana continue on.  Just as she passes 
	out of sight, Lwaxana rubs her forehead.

42   NEW ANGLE

	On Bashir and Kira.  Both Bashir and Kira rub their temples 
	momentarily.

					BASHIR
			I should get to the Infirmary.

					KIRA
			I'll join you.

	They begin to walk.

					KIRA
			Maybe you should examine Bareil and 
			Jake while you're at it.

					BASHIR
			That's not a bad idea.

43   INT. SURGERY

	Kira and Bashir ENTER the surgery section of the Infirmary.

					BASHIR
			This won't take long.

	But instead of moving toward the monitors, Bashir turns to

	other and kiss passionately.

	And as the kiss grows more intense...

44   INT. WARDROOM

	The Wardroom table is set with numerous trays of food.  Sisko, 
	Dax, Odo, O'Brien, Jake, Bareil, and Lwaxana are scattered 
	around the Wardroom, eating dinner.

	O'Brien is seated alone in one corner of the room, barely 
	picking at his food.  He looks sad and abandoned.

45   LWAXANA AND ODO

	Are seated not far away.  For a change, they're not talking.  
	When Lwaxana finally speaks, after a beat of awkward silence, 
	it's with serious concern as opposed to her usual vivacity.

					LWAXANA
			What is it, Odo?
				(off his reaction)
			I may not be able to read your 
			emotions, but I can read your 
			expression.  Something's wrong.

					ODO
			I'm fine.

					LWAXANA
				(frowns)
			I wish you'd tell me what's bothering 
			you.  It might make you feel better.

					ODO
			As soon as something bothers me, 
			I'll let you know.
				(gives her a small 
				smile)
			I promise.

					LWAXANA
			Why is it I find stubborn men so 
			attractive?

46   NEW ANGLE

	To include the buffet table, where Dax is piling her plate 
	full of food.  Bareil is standing next to her, looking at 
	her like a lovesick puppy.

					DAX
			Would you please stop following me?

					BAREIL
			Gladly... if you'll stop running 
			away.  I have something important to 
			discuss with you.

					DAX
			Discuss it with Kira.  I'm not 
			interested.

	She turns and walks away.

					BAREIL
			But I don't want to talk to Kira.

47   ANGLE ON SISKO AND JAKE

	Sisko is at another part of the buffet table, looking like 
	he's not having the greatest time either as he's being 
	pestered by Jake.

					JAKE
			But Dad, you promised that Nerys 
			would be here.

					SISKO
			She will be.  And stop calling her 
			Nerys.

	Suddenly Sisko stiffens as he is goosed by someone off-screen.  
	He turns around and sees it's Dax.

					DAX
				(mischievous)
			Peldor Joi.

	She walks away, looking over her shoulder, giving him a come-
	hither look.  Odo and Lwaxana, who have witnessed this 
	exchange, join Sisko.

					LWAXANA
			Commander, I didn't know you and 
			Lieutenant Dax were so close.

				(troubled)
			We're not.

			Constable, I want you to get him and

	Odo nods his agreement.

				(to Lwaxana)
			I'll be right back.

					LWAXANA
			I'll come with you.

					ODO
				(that's what he

			Of course you will.

48   INT. SURGERY

	Kira is seated on a console, embracing Bashir, who's standing 
	in front of her.  They are kissing with the frenzied passion 
	of two high-schoolers at the prom.

					BASHIR
			I wonder what Commander Sisko wanted?

					KIRA
			It can wait.

					BASHIR
				(between kisses)
			This is very embarrassing.

					KIRA
				(still kissing)
			I agree.  We have to stop.

					BASHIR
			Definitely.

					ODO
			Doctor...

	Odo stops as he sees what's going on.  Bashir breaks off for 
	a second, but Kira keeps kissing his neck.

	Odo can hardly speak, and if changelings could blush, he'd 
	be bright red.

					ODO
			Commander Sisko needs to see you in 
			the Wardroom.

					BASHIR
			Tell him...
				(as Kira kisses him)
			I'll be along shortly.

					ODO
				(stern)
			Now, Doctor.

	And there's something in his voice that makes Lwaxana study 
	Odo with new insight.

					KIRA
				(to Bashir)
			You'd better go.

					BASHIR
			Right.

	They walk out hand in hand.

					KIRA
				(to Lwaxana and Odo)
			Peldor Joi.

	They EXIT, leaving Odo standing there, stricken.

50   INT. WARDROOM

	Dax is standing behind Sisko with her arms draped over his 
	chest.  She's using him as a shield to avoid Bareil.  Sisko 
	is trying to extricate himself from Dax while at the same 
	time keeping himself between her and Bareil.

					BAREIL
			Please step aside, Commander.  I 
			need to talk to Jadzia in private.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FIVE        56.

50   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I'm afraid she doesn't want to talk 
			to you.

					DAX
			You tell him, Benjamin.

					BAREIL
			But I only want to give her this.

	Bareil holds up and beautiful latinum bracelet.

					SISKO
			A Bajoran betrothal bracelet?

					DAX
			Can I see that?

	Dax reaches over Sisko's shoulder and plucks the bracelet 
	out of Bareil's hand.  Just then the doors open and Kira and 
	Bashir, still holding hands, ENTER, followed by Odo and 
	Lwaxana.  Jake runs up to Kira.

					JAKE
			Nerys, am I glad to see you.

	Kira walks right by him.  Jake sees that she's holding hands 
	with Bashir.  He's crushed.

	Bashir and Kira reach Sisko, who steps out from between Dax 
	and Bareil.

					SISKO
			Doctor, I need your help.

					BASHIR
			I need yours too.

	Bashir leans over to speak to Sisko without letting go of 
	Kira's hand.

					BASHIR
			You've got to get me away from Kira.  
			I can't keep my hands off her.

	Kira kisses Bashir.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/10/94 - ACT FIVE        57.

50   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA
			And what's worse, I can't keep my

	Sisko looks to Odo.

					ODO
			I can't explain it either.

51   NEW ANGLE

	As Jake sits down next to O'Brien.

					JAKE
			She doesn't love me.

	O'Brien's too wrapped up in his own problems to get too worked 
	up about Jake's.

					O'BRIEN
			Who?

					JAKE
			Nerys.

					O'BRIEN
			You're better off.  In the end, they 
			only break your heart.

	Just then O'Brien's attention is drawn to the door as Keiko 
	ENTERS.  She's wearing a beautiful, form-fitting red dress.  
	O'Brien's jaw drops.  He's amazed.

					O'BRIEN
				(to himself)
			Although sometimes it's worth it.

	O'Brien walks up to Keiko.

					KEIKO
				(re: the dress)
			What do you think?

					O'BRIEN
			You look beautiful.

					KEIKO
			Miles, did you really hand in your 
			resignation?

	O'Brien nods.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/10/94 - ACT FIVE        58.

51   CONTINUED:

					KEIKO
			You'd better get it back before 
			Commander Sisko sees it.
				(a beat)
			But it was nice of you to offer.

	They kiss, gently, intimately, then embrace.

					KEIKO
			I love you so much.

	As they kiss again, Quark ENTERS, carrying a tray of food.  
	He spots Sisko and joins him.

					QUARK
				(re: the food)
			Commander, here's that Idanian spice 
			pudding you ordered...

	But before Sisko can acknowledge Quark, Dax steps up behind 
	him and takes him by the shoulder.  She gently turns him 
	toward her until their faces are inches apart.

					DAX
			I want you to have this...
				(she gives him the 
				betrothal bracelet)
			As a token of my affection.

	This is the last straw for Bareil, who is only a few feet 
	away.

					BAREIL
			Oh, no you don't.

	Bareil punches Sisko, who's more surprised than hurt.  Quark, 
	who's been caught in the middle of this, tries desperately 
	to get out of the way and avoid spilling the tray of pudding.

	Bareil unloads with another couple of swings, which Sisko 
	blocks.

					SISKO
			Bareil, listen to me...

					BAREIL
			If I have to fight for her I will.

	Bareil takes another swing, Sisko blocks it, and Dax steps 
	up to Bareil and decks him.  Quark once again has to make a 
	heroic effort not to spill the pudding.

51   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX
				(to Sisko)
			I'm sorry, Benjamin, but he was really 
			starting to annoy me.

					QUARK
			Commander... You throw one hell of a 
			party.

	Quark offers the tray of pudding cups to Lwaxana.

					QUARK
			Pudding, anyone?

	Lwaxana massages her temples, overcome by another severe 
	headache.

					LWAXANA
			No thank you.

	Quark also grabs his forehead.  Sisko and Odo both notice 
	his gesture and exchange a look.

					DAX
			I'll take one.

	But as Dax reaches out for a pudding cup...

					QUARK
				(his mind elsewhere)
			Help yourself.

	Quark absentmindedly hands the whole tray to Dax, his 
	attention totally focussed on something across the room.

52   INCLUDE KEIKO AND O'BRIEN

	Who, along with Bashir, have gone to see if Bareil is all 
	right.  The Vedek has sat up, but he's holding his jaw.

					KEIKO
			Are you okay?

	Suddenly Quark drops to his knees next to Keiko.

					QUARK
			Forget about him.  What about me?
				(off her reaction)
			I need you Keiko.  My lobes tingle 
			at the sight of you...
				(a beat)
			Marry me.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FIVE        60.

52   CONTINUED:

	O'Brien grabs Quark by the lapels and hauls him to his 
	feet.

					O'BRIEN
			She's taken, Quark...

	Sisko and Odo come up and restrain O'Brien.  They've witnessed 
	the entire chain of events, Lwaxana's headache, followed 
	immediately by Quark's headache, and Quark's subsequent 
	attraction to Keiko, and they think they've identified the 
	source of the problem.

					SISKO
			Easy, Chief.  He doesn't know what 
			he's doing.

	Sisko and Odo turn toward Lwaxana, who looks surprised.

					LWAXANA
			What are you looking at me for?

53   INT. SURGERY

	Bashir has just completed examining Lwaxana as Sisko watches.

					LWAXANA
			Zanthi Fever?  But that's impossible.  
			It only effects... older Betazoids.

					BASHIR
			That may be, but according to my 
			tests, you're showing all the 
			symptoms.
				(to Sisko)
			Zanthi Fever is a virus that effects 
			the empathic abilities of... mature 
			Betazoids.  It causes them to project 
			their own emotions onto others.

					SISKO
			So then Mrs. Troi's amorous feelings 
			for...
				(delicately)
			... someone on the station were being 
			passed along to the people around 
			her.

					BASHIR
			Not everyone.  Only people who were 
			in close proximity to her when she 
			had an attack.  And even then there 
			would have to have been a pre-existing 
			latent attraction.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FIVE        61.

53   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			You're saying Dax... ?

					BASHIR
			Only on a subconscious level.
				(a beat)
			Best not to think about it too much, 
			if you ask me.

	This gives Sisko one more thing to worry about.

					LWAXANA
			Commander, I'm so sorry.  I hope I 
			haven't caused you too much trouble.

					SISKO
			I doubt there was any permanent harm 
			done.
				(to Bashir, hopeful)
			Right, Doctor?

					BASHIR
			A simple wide spectrum antiviral 
			agent should cure Mrs. Troi, and as 
			for everyone else... they should 
			return to normal in a day or two.

	Bashir puts down his medical tricorder.

					BASHIR
			Now if you'll excuse me, I promised 
			I'd meet Nerys in her quarters.

	As he turns to go, Sisko lays a gentle restraining hand on 
	his shoulder.

					SISKO
			I think you ought to postpone that 
			visit.  For a day or two.

	Bashir looks disappointed, but sees the wisdom of Sisko's 
	advice.

54   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE -  STOCK (OPTICAL)

	As usual.

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/11/94 - ACT FIVE        62.

54   CONTINUED:

					SISKO (V.O.)
			Commander's log, supplemental.  I'm 
			happy to report that Doctor Bashir's 
			diagnosis has been proven correct.  
			My son and all the other's affected 
			by Mrs. Troi's condition have made 
			full recoveries.

55   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	Odo and Lwaxana walk by the viewports.  The Gratitude Festival 
	decorations are gone.

					LWAXANA
			Well, this is one Gratitude Festival 
			they'll be talking about for a long 
			time.

					ODO
			I know I'll never forget it.

					LWAXANA
			I hope everything works out for you, 
			Odo.
				(off his puzzled look)
			With Major Kira.

					ODO
			I don't know what you mean.

					LWAXANA
			Don't worry.  Your secret is safe 
			with me.  After all, I know what 
			it's like to be attracted to someone 
			who doesn't necessarily feel the 
			same way.

	Odo's silence serves to confirm Lwaxana's suspicions.

					LWAXANA
			But if you ever get tired of waiting 
			for her...

	She kisses him.

					LWAXANA
			You know where to find me.

					ODO
				(gently)
			I'll keep that in mind.

	She smiles and walks away.

56   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR

	Keiko, O'Brien and Molly are saying their good-byes at the 
	airlock.

					KEIKO
			So, you're sure Doctor Bashir said 
			your test results were negative?

					O'BRIEN
			That's right.  My headache was just 
			a headache.  I never was affected by 
			Mrs. Troi.

					KEIKO
				(playful)
			I guess that means you don't have a 
			latent attraction to me after all.

					O'BRIEN
			There's nothing latent about it.  Or 
			weren't you paying attention last 
			night?

					KEIKO
			I was paying attention all right.  
			You've still got the touch, O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN
			So do you... , O'Brien.

	O'Brien bends down to talk to Molly.

					O'BRIEN
			Take good care of Mommy, honey.

					MOLLY
			I will.

	He gives her a hug and a kiss, then straightens up to take 
	Keiko in his arms and give her one last kiss goodbye.

					KEIKO
			See you in a few months.

					O'BRIEN
			I can hardly wait.

	And with one last look, Molly and Keiko climb the steps into 
	the airlock and disappear down the corridor.

	O'Brien watches them for a beat, then...

        DEEP SPACE: "Fascination" - REV. 10/10/94 - ACT FIVE        64.

					BASHIR (O.S.)
			Chief?

	O'Brien turns and sees Bashir standing down the hall, carrying 
	two racquetball racquets.  Without another word, Bashir tosses 
	one of the racquets to O'Brien, who catches it with one hand.  
	O'Brien glances at the closed airlock doors, then he and 
	Bashir walk side-by-side away down the corridor.

									FADE OUT.
