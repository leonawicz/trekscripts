	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - PLANET (OPTICAL) (STOCK)

	A Runabout orbits a brown-gray planet.


					SISKO (V.O.)
			Captain's log, Stardate 50049.3. 
			We're conducting a mineral survey 
			of Torga Four, an uninhabited 
			planet in the Gamma Quadrant 
			believed to contain vast deposits 
			of cormaline.2    EXT. ROCK PLANET - DAY

	CLOSE ON A MAN'S BOOT climbing the desolate rocky sand 
	dunes of this inhospitably hot and barren landscape.

					SISKO (V.O.)
			Our mission is to determine the 
			feasibility of establishing a 
			mining operation on the planet's 
			surface.

3    WIDER

	to REVEAL O'BRIEN struggling to keep up with MUNIZ
	(first seen in "Hard Time"), a young human crewman with 
	an easy, infectious smile, climbing the steep dune. 
	O'Brien, wanting to catch his breath, pretends to find 
	something interesting.

					O'BRIEN
			Hey, Muniz... what do you think of 
			this?

	Muniz stops his ascent and moves over to see what 
	O'Brien finds so interesting. O'Brien has taken out 
	his tricorder and is studiously examining the readings -- 
	all the while catching his breath.

					MUNIZ
				(what's the big deal?)
			Class Five pyroclastic debris and 
			ash... same morphology we've seen 
			all the way up, sir.

         DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - TEASER          

3    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			How many times do I have to tell 
			you to stop calling me "sir." I'm 
			not an officer.

					MUNIZ
			No, you know more than they do.

					O'BRIEN
			I wouldn't go that far. But I 
			know more than you. So listen to 
			me while I try to teach you 
			something. This is not exactly 
			the same morphology... these 
			deposits are more highly eroded.

					MUNIZ
			So?

					O'BRIEN
			So, they're different. That's 
			all... I just thought I'd point it 
			out to you.

					MUNIZ
			I see.
				(knowing better)
			I thought maybe you just stopped 
			to catch your breath.

					O'BRIEN
			Me? Out of breath? I was 
			climbing mountains in Ireland 
			before you were out of diapers.

					MUNIZ
			You mean hills, don't you? They 
			have gently sloping, hills in 
			Ireland. No mountains.
				(a beat)
			But... what do I know? After all, 
			you're the mountain man...

	Muniz passes O'Brien.

					MUNIZ
				(as if to himself)
			An old mountain man.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - TEASER       3-4.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
				(calling out to him)
			You know, Muniz -- you're due for 
			a transfer. How do you feel about 
			waste extraction?

4    OMITTED

5    EXT. ROCK PLANET - BASE CAMP - DAY

	SISKO, DAX and WORF arrive at the base camp where 
	O'Brien and Muniz are looking over some of the soil 
	samples they collected on their survey. In the b.g., 
	T'LOR, a Tiburonian with a somber disposition, works on 
	a PADD amidst the Federation geological tools and 
	equipment.

					SISKO 
			How's it going, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			Fine, sir. We finished our survey 
			of the south slope.

	O'Brien hands the PADD to Sisko as he takes a deep 
	thirst-quenching drink of water. Sisko looks over the 
	data PADD as he steps over to Dax, sitting under a tarp 
	covering some equipment.

					SISKO 
			What do you think, old man? Is 
			this place worth mining?

	Dax looks over the data PADD.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - TEASER         5.

6    CONTINUED:

					DAX
			Absolutely. The cormaline is only 
			a few hundred meters below the 
			surface... and if these readings 
			are correct, it's one of the 
			richest veins I've ever seen.

	Sisko looks over the area.

					SISKO 
			Mister Worf?

					WORF
			Strategically, the planet's 
			location would make it difficult 
			to maintain adequate support lines --
			but not impossible.

	Sisko nods as his communicator CHIRPS.

					HOYA (V.O.)
			Hoya to Captain Sisko.

					SISKO 
			Go ahead.

6    OMITTED

7    INT. RUNABOUT

	HOYA, a female Benzite, is at the helm. Two other 
	CREWMEN are in the b.g., minding their posts.

					HOYA
			Sir, our sensors have detected a 
			ship dropping out of warp --

					SISKO 
			What kind of ship?

					HOYA
			I'm not sure, Sir. I can't get a 
			good reading on it -- plasma leaks 
			from its warp nacelles are 
			disrupting our sensors.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - TEASER         6.

8    EXT. ROCK PLANET - BASE CAMP - DAY

					HOYA (V.O.)
			But whatever it is -- it's fallen 
			into the gravitational pull of the 
			planet. It should enter the 
			atmosphere near your position.

	Sisko and Dax look to the sky.

9    SISKO'S POV (OPTICAL)

	as a bright red-orange flair streaks across the sky 
	like a giant shooting star, disappearing over the 
	horizon. A second later, a BOOMING EXPLOSION ECHOES 
	in the distance.

10   ON SISKO AND THE OTHERS

	reacting to what they've just witnessed.

					HOYA (V.O.)
			Sir -- the ship withstood the 
			impact.

					SISKO
			Survivors?

 					HOYA (V.O.)
			I can't determine that -- we're 
			having trouble penetrating the 
			hull with our sensors.

					SISKO

			Beam us directly to the crash 
			site.

	During this, Worf, O'Brien, Dax, Muniz and T'Lor have 
	not wasted their time -- they've armed themselves, 
	grabbed a Medkit and are ready for transport.

11   EXT. ROCK PLANET - CRASH SITE - DAY (OPTICAL)

	In another equally inhospitable section of the sand-
	covered planet -- Sisko, Dax, Worf, O'Brien, Muniz and 
	T'Lor MATERIALIZE. Sisko looks around and reacts to --

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - TEASER         7.

12   SISKO'S POV

	An impressive-looking starship is burrowed into the 
	rocky,sandy cliffside.

	The ship is UPSIDE DOWN, burrowed into the ground so 
	only its tail juts out, like a whale plunging into the 
	sea.

13   WIDER

	to include O'Brien and the others. Worf, O'Brien, Dax, 
	Muniz and T'Lor ready their weapons.

					WORF
			It's warship... a Jem'Hadar 
			warship.

	And on their looks of amazement and expectant danger, 
	we:

									FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

OA   EXT. ROCK PLANET - CRASH SITE - DAY

	Re-establishing. Minutes later.

14   EXT. ROCK PLANET - JEM'HADAR SHIP - DAY

	Sisko is standing at the foot of the hull of this very 
	impressive ship. Worf is standing next to him, his 
	weapon at the ready. Dax and T'Lor emerge, coming 
	around the left side of the ship having circled it.

					DAX
			No hull breaches. The only damage 
			I could find is a crushed guidance 
			thruster -- or what looks like 
			one.

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
			Captain --

	Sisko looks up to see O'Brien leaning over the lip of 
	the ship's wing. He and Muniz are standing on the 
	underbelly of the ship.

					O'BRIEN
			-- I think we have an access 
			point.

	Sisko, Dax, Worf and T'Lor move around the ship to join 
	O'Brien.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE       8A.

15   ANGLE ON O'BRIEN AND MUNIZ

	kneeling down on the underbelly of the ship, examining 
	what appears to be a large, rectangular access hatch.

					O'BRIEN
			So... my young friend, what do you
			think we're looking at?

					MUNIZ
			An upside down ship.

	O'Brien shoots Muniz a look -- "don't get smart with 
	me."

					O'BRIEN
			An airlock... a maintenance hatch?

	Muniz studies the outlines carefully.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE        9.

15   CONTINUED:

					MUNIZ
			Maybe... but this is a warship...
				(thinking)
			and on a warship, you want a
			big access point on the belly
			to... land troops.

	O'Brien is proud of his number one guy.

					O'BRIEN
			There's hope for you yet, Muniz. 
			Now, you ready to race me up that 
			hill?

 					MUNIZ
			Anytime you say, Jefe.

					O'BRIEN
			You see -- that's your problem -- 
			you're so easily distracted. 
				(re: the ship)
			Stay focused on the task at hand.

	Sisko and the others climb onto the hull.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE          

15   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WORF
				(re: the hatch)
			Can you open it, Chief?

	O'Brien nods as he discovers and pops open a small 
	panel.

					O'BRIEN
			I think so.

	O'Brien works his magic as Worf and the others take up 
	positions with their weapons trained on the hatch.

16   NEW ANGLE

	to see the massive landing ramp swing up. There's a 
	long tense moment as they peer into the darkness -- 
	expecting Jem'Hadar soldiers to pour out at any moment. 
	But nothing happens.

	Then, Sisko nods to Worf.

					SISKO
			Mister Worf -- take the point.
			T'Lor -- you stay put.

	Worf activates the light beacon on his rifle. Worf 
	then ENTERS into the darkness. The others follow.

	As Muniz and'O'Brien approach the hatch, O'Brien 
	catches Muniz's eye and gives him a confident nod.
	Muniz EXHALES, bolstered by O'Brien's calm and easy 
	demeanor.

	Muniz goes in after O'Brien, leaving only T'Lor on the 
	hull, guarding.

17   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - CORRIDOR - DAY

	Worf leads Sisko, Dax, O'Brien and Muniz through the 
	canted, dark corridor. Since the ship is upside down, 
	they are all walking on the ceiling of the ship's 
	corridor.

	They move cautiously, hugging the walls -- their PALM 
	AND PHASER RIFLE LIGHT BEACONS cut through the dense, 
	SMOKE-FILLED atmosphere.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE       11.

17   CONTINUED:

	Some of the ship's systems have obviously been damaged 
	in the crash -- a broken hose still shooting out gas-
	steam, a few pipes dripping water.

	The Away Team cautiously descends until they reach a 
	fork in the road: an airlock passage with a hatch door 
	leading upward, and a corridor that continues.

					SISKO
				(to Worf, pointing down 
				the corridor)
			Commander.

	Worf nods and moves down the corridor, EXITING.

	Sisko turns his attention to the hatch. He signals to 
	O'Brien -- "open it." O'Brien climbs the ladder to the 
	hatch as Sisko positions himself to one side, his rifle
	aimed at the hatch. Dax keeps her phaser pointed the 
	way they came, covering their backs.

	Using a high-tech hand tool, O'Brien trips the door's 
	lock, then carefully opens it just a crack.

	We hear the familiar SOUND of the AIRLOCK SEAL being 
	broken, then silence. O'Brien takes a beat before 
	proceeding to open the hatch the rest of the way. Once 
	the hatch door is open, Sisko hands O'Brien a  
	palmlight beacon, so he can peer into the dark shaft. 
	One by one, they ENTER the hatch.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29-/96 - ACT ONE       12.


18   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

	Shafts of light from the palm beacons dance through the 
	floor hatch (which normally functions as a ceiling 
	hatch). O'Brien is the first to emerge, leading the 
	others into what we will come to know as the "Command 
	Center."

	O'Brien take a few steps into the room when his light 
	comes upon a grisly sight -- the upside down FACE OF A 
	JEM'HADAR SOLDIER hanging like a dead bat. Startled, 
	O'Brien is about to open fire on the Jem'Hadar soldier 
	before he realizes that the soldier is already dead -- 
	his face frozen in agony.

	Sisko and the others scan the room with their light 
	beacons to discover SEVERAL OTHER DEAD JEM'HADAR 
	SOLDIERS hanging from the ceiling, suspended by odd-
	looking plasma conduits that are strapped to their feet 
	and run up to their bodies. A few OTHER JEM'HADAR 
	SOLDIERS are sprawled on the ground -- including a 
	female VORTA -- all with the same expression of agony.

	Sisko and the others examine the inverted room: the 
	Command Center of the ship and its configuration is 
	unlike anything we've seen before. There is no 
	viewscreen. No chairs. No creature comforts of any 
	kind. Instead of the usual Captain's Chair, there is 
	a central "position" with several sophisticated gadgets 
	protruding from the floor and ceiling. The other 
	"positions," or stations, are all pointed inward -- 
	toward the central position -- in such a way that 
	anybody manning those stations would face the central 
	position. There are three side doors and two floor 
	hatches leading to other parts of the ship.

					SISKO
				(pointing at one of the 
				doors)
			Muniz.

	Muniz nods and cautiously EXITS through the door.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE       13.

18   CONTINUED:

	Dax examines the dead soldiers with her tricorder.

					DAX
			These men didn't die in the 
			crash... they've been dead for 
			hours.

					SISKO
			What killed them?

					DAX
			Massive osteo-necrosis. Every 
			bone in their bodies has been 
			shattered.

					O'BRIEN
			Sounds like inertial damper 
			failure -- the ship accelerated 
			and people were thrown into the 
			bulkheads.

19   NEW ANGLE


	as Sisko steps up to the body of the JEM'HADAR FIRST, 
	who is lying near central "position" with the now-
	familiar expression of agony. Nearby, O'Brien examines 
	the ship.

					O'BRIEN
			There was nobody alive when the 
			ship hit the planet... but it 
			still survived the impact.
				(impressed)
			Whoever designed this baby knew 
			what they were doing.

	O'Brien climbs up on something to look at the panels on 
	the deck above.

20   ON SISKO

	as he examines the room.

					DAX
				(looking around)
			No viewscreen. No chairs.

					O'BRIEN
			No EPS conduits, no microfusion 
			initiators, not even any power 
			converters -- at least not that I 
			can find.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE      13A.

20   CONTINUED:

	Sisko wipes the sweat from his brow. It was a boiling 
	inferno outside the ship -- inside it's worse.

					SISKO
			Then I suppose getting this ship 
			up and running won't be easy.

					O'BRIEN
			I can't even determine what kind 
			of warp drive it has.

	Sisko walks around the room, taking in what he sees.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE       14.

20   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			I wonder if this is what all 
			Jem'Hadar ships are like?

					SISKO
			The bigger question is -- what's 
			a Jem'Hadar ship doing all the way 
			out here? We're at least three 
			weeks from the nearest Dominion 
			outpost.

	There's no answer to that. Muniz ENTERS, having 
	completed their mission. They step up to Sisko.

					MUNIZ
			Twenty-nine other bodies -- no 
			survivors.

	Sisko nods, thinks for a moment and turns to O'Brien.

					SISKO
			Can we use the runabout's tractor 
			beam to haul this thing into 
			orbit?

	Everyone exchanges surprised looks -- they weren't 
	expecting that question.

					SISKO
			This is the greatest intelligence 
			find in the last ten years. We're

	O'Brien looks around, thinking over the possibilities --
	it's a big undertaking.

22   INT. OPS

	KIRA ENTERS from the captain's office to find ODO, 
	BASHIR and QUARK in a heated argument.

					QUARK
			If you're going to prosecute me --
			I demand you prosecute my co-
			conspirator.

					BASHIR
			I am not a conspirator!


						ODO
			What would you call yourself, 
			doctor?

					BASHIR 
			An idiot --

					QUARK
			I won't dispute that.

					BASHIR
				(to Quark)
			-- for asking your help in the 
			first place!

	Kira steps in the middle of the fray.

					KIRA
			Would someone tell me what's going 
			on here?

	Bashir and Quark just glare at each other... Odo looks 
	them over as he explains to Kira.


					ODO
			Quark brought aboard a shipment of 
			Regalian fleaspiders without an 
			import permit.

					QUARK
				(pointing to Bashir)
			He asked me for them!

						BASHIR 
			The spiders were for you, major. 
			I can synthesize a drug from their 
			venom that should improve your 
			circulation.
				(to Odo)
			But I didn't know I needed a 
			permit to import them.

					KIRA
			So what's the problem? Fill out 
			the paperwork.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT ONE       16.

22   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			It's not that simple anymore... it 
			seems that Quark took the 
			opportunity to "import" illegal 
			Regalian liquid crystals along 
			with the fleaspiders. The 
			crystals are a highly intoxicating 
			and sometimes dangerous 
			aphrodisiac.

					QUARK
			What's love without danger?

	Kira shakes her head.

					KIRA
			I don't have time for this. I 
			just spoke to Captain Sisko. They 
			found a crashed Jem'Hadar ship in 
			the Gamma Quadrant and they need 
			the Defiant right away. 
				(to Odo)
			I'll be back in about a week.

					BASHIR 
			When do we leave?

					KIRA
			I'm leaving right away -- but I'd 
			say you have some legal 
			problems to work out.


	Kira EXITS, leaving Bashir with a stunned expression. 
	Quark smiles at his "co-conspirator." Odo puts a hand 
	on each one of their shoulders.

					ODO
			Gentlemen...

			into the rock. But if I can shake 
			her loose by firing the main

			a lot easier.

					SISKO
			But there's a problem...

					O'BRIEN
				(nods)
			To fire up the main thrusters, I 
			need to calibrate the plasma 
			injectors, but so far, I can't even 
			grip the ion flow regulator.

 					MUNIZ
			Want to try a hyper-spanner above 
			the matrix? It might open it up 
			a bit.

					O'BRIEN
				(good thought)
			Maybe we won't send you to waste

	As Muniz reaches over and gives O'Brien the desired 
	tool, Worf, Dax and T'Lor approach carrying phaser 
	rifles and covered in sweat, muck and dirt. Worf steps

	Moments later. Everyone has grabbed their weapons and 
	stands ready for battle. Sisko barks out:

					SISKO
			Inside. We don't stand a chance 
			in the open--

	Sisko is cut off by a BLAST of PHASER FIRE. He turns 
	to see T'lor taking a phaser hit in the chest from a

36   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as everyone stays very still and quiet -- fully 
	expecting a Jem'Hadar soldier to shimmer out of the 
	darkness of the corridor. After a long silent beat, 
	they hear MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS of the Jem'Hadar walking on 
	the hull overhead. After another long beat, the 
	footsteps stop. A long silence.

					WORF
			Why aren't they coming?

					SISKO
			Give them time. Watch our backs, 
			Commander.
				(then to everyone)
			We're moving to the Command

	Muniz, who is leaning against the bulkhead gets to his

	Sisko moves up to the injured Muniz, who is leaning 
	against the bulkhead and holding his own wound with his

	seeping out from between his fingers.

					SISKO
				(re: Muniz's wound)
			Let me take a look at that.

	Muniz tries to wave Sisko off.

					MUNIZ
			I'm all right, Captain. I've had

					SISKO
			Where's the Medkit?

					DAX
			T'lor had it.

	Great.

 					MUNIZ
			I don't need it, sir. I'll be all

	Sisko doesn't believe him for a second, but he smiles 
	at the crewman's attitude.

					SISKO
			We have to stop the bleeding --

					O'BRIEN
			I'll take care of it.

	Sisko nods and steps away; he understands O'Brien 
	wanting to take care of his own crewman. As soon as 
	Sisko is out of earshot, Muniz lets out a painful 
	GROAN.

					O'BRIEN
			A transporter burn, eh? "I'll be

			Don't worry, when we get back,

	As O'Brien works to apply his makeshift compress, Muniz 
	asks:

 					MUNIZ
			How long 'til the Defiant gets here?

					O'BRIEN
			Two and a half days.

	Two and a half hours in this place seems like a long 
	time -- two and a half days, that's a lifetime.

 					MUNIZ
			Don't worry, Jefe... I'll get you

	She hands the battery pack up to O'Brien, who takes it

	Muniz is still in pain, but it's manageable. Dax looks 
	at Muniz.

					DAX
			Looks like you need a new bandage,

	Dax starts to take off Muniz's bloody bandage. The 
	only other person in the room is Sisko, who is 
	examining the headset piece he found on the Jem'Hadar 
	First. The room is quite dark, illuminated only by a 
	few of the ship's BLINKIES and a palm beacon.

	Suddenly, the ship's emergency lights POP ON.

					SISKO
			Thanks, Chief.

	O'Brien steps down to tend to Muniz.

			Captain, I'm so happy to hear your

			feared you may have been one of

					SISKO
				(dry)
			Thank you for your concern. What

					KILANA (O.S.)
			To talk. I think it would be in

	A good distance away from the ship, Sisko finds himself

	female Vorta with a drop-dead gorgeous body and 
	intelligent eyes. Worf stands by the open landing 
	hatch, weapon at the ready, eyeing his opposite number --
	the Jem'Hadar escort for Kilana. Sisko and Kilana are 
	just out of earshot from either of their escorts.

	Kilana speaks with the slightly unctuous empathy of an 
	able negotiator and experienced dealmaker. She smiles 
	pleasantly at Sisko.

					KILANA
			Your photograph doesn't do you

	Kilana circles Sisko a bit.

					KILANA
			So let me "cut to the chase" -- I 
			believe that is the correct 
			expression. This is our ship. We

					SISKO
			It was your ship. Now it's mine.

	Kilana is taken aback -- she appears completely 
	surprised by Sisko's attitude.

					KILANA
			Captain, I'm a little 
			disappointed. That's the attitude 
			of a thief -- not a Starfleet 
			captain with a reputation for 
			integrity.
				(re: the ship)
			This is clearly our property. 
			What gives you any claim to it?

					SISKO
			A very old legal tradition... 
			salvage rights. We found a 
			wrecked ship with a dead crew. 
			And we found it first.

	Kilana studies her opponent -- is he serious? Is that

					KILANA
			A very interesting position...
				(the ultimate diplomat)

			And what may be even more to the

			surrounded and outnumbered...

	Sisko keeps his poker face. She looks at him for a 
	long beat. She smiles ruefully.

					KILANA
			Would you like something to eat,

	O'Brien raises his rifle and takes aim at the device. 
	But before he can squeeze the trigger -- the Jem'Hadar

			was a knife.

					WORF
			And why send only one Jem'Hadar?

	Sisko looks around the ship for a moment, considering 
	the possibilities.

					SISKO
			There's something about this 
			ship... something so important 
			they won't risk destroying it in 
			a full-on assault.

					WORF
			If that's true, we need to find 
			out what it is.


					DAX
			The first thing we need to do is 
			make a structural scan of the 
			ship... make our own blueprints.

					SISKO
			Get started.

	Worf and Dax head for the door.

					WORF
			It would be most efficient if we 
			each began at opposite ends of the
			ship and met back in the middle.

					DAX
				(with a twinkle)
			I'll count the minutes we're 
			apart.

	Worf and Dax EXIT.

56   NEW ANGLE

	Muniz lets out a painful GROAN. O'Brien is still 
	attending to him.

					MUNIZ
			I'm leaking like a ruptured plasma 
			conduit aren't I, sir?

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 ACT THREE      35A.

56   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			It's not so bad.

					MUNIZ
				(simply)
			You're lying.

					O'BRIEN
			What makes you say that?


					MUNIZ

			I called you "sir" and you didn't 
			even flinch. I must be dying.

					O'BRIEN
			Let's get one thing straight, 
			Quique. You're not dying unless I 
			say you're dying. And I say 
			you're going to make it.

	Sisko steps over to them.

					SISKO
			How are you doing, Muniz?

	Muniz struggles to smile.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE      36.

56   CONTINUED:	(2)

					MUNIZ
				(re: O'Brien and 
				himself)
			We seem to be having a difference 
			of opinion on that one, sir. But 
			I do want to file a complaint.

	O'Brien removes Muniz's blood-drenched bandage in order 
	to apply a new one. Muniz winces, trying his best to 
	suppress the pain.

					MUNIZ
			The nurses around here are all 
			thumbs.

					O'BRIEN
			Watch it there, Quique. Or I'll 
			tighten this bandage like a 
			tourniquet.

	Muniz strains to lean over to the Captain.

					MUNIZ
			And as for bedside manner -- I've 
			known nicer voles. Certainly 
			prettier ones...

					O'BRIEN
			If you keep moving you won't need 
			any nursing.

					SISKO
				(with a warm smile)
			Listen to the Chief, Muniz. Save 
			your strength.

	O'Brien finishes dressing Muniz's wound.

57   NEW ANGLE

	O'Brien and Sisko step out of earshot from Muniz.


					O'BRIEN
			I'm worried about him, Captain. 
			I can't stop the bleeding.

	Sisko looks toward Muniz.

					SISKO
			Maybe it's a side effect of the 
			Jem'Hadar weapons... they must 
			leave some kind of anti-coagulant.

					O'BRIEN
			We need to get him to a medical 
			bay or he's not going to make it.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE         

57   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(calmly)
			None of us is going to make it if 
			we don't get this ship 
			operational.

	Sisko is speaking firmly, but not harshly.

					SISKO
				(continuing)
			I need the power grid functioning 
			and the aft turret weapon on-line. 
			You're the only one who can do 
			that. I'll take care of Muniz...

					O'BRIEN
			But Captain --


					SISKO
			You have your orders, Chief.

	A beat, then O'Brien nods and, after looking back at 
	Muniz for a moment, steps away to do as instructed. 
	O'Brien picks up his tools but it's clear his mind is 
	still on his injured crewmate.

58   EXT. ROCK PLANET - CRASH SITE - DAY

	Re-establishing.

59   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - CORRIDOR - DAY

	Worf and Dax are showing O'Brien something on a 
	Federation PADD. O'Brien has been working on an open 
	panel on the floor (which is really the ceiling).

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE      38.

S9   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			Structurally, a lot about this 
			ship's design matches the other 
			Jem'Hadar warships we've seen.

					WORF
			But there are some significant 
			differences. There are many 
			systems we are completely 
			unfamiliar with.

					O'BRIEN
			I can start to restore power to 
			the systems one at a time -- 
			that'll give us a chance to test 
			them and establish their functions.
				(thinking)
			But that's going to take a while.

					WORF
			How long?

					O'BRIEN
			I wish I knew.

					DAX
			You'll do it, Chief. I don't 
			think anyone's invented a ship yet 
			that you can't figure out.

	O'Brien only half smiles at the compliment, and from 
	this, Dax can see his mind is elsewhere.

					DAX
			Muniz is strong.
				(confident)
			He'll make it.

					WORF
			No, he won't.

	Dax and O'Brien look sharply at Worf. Worf is speaking 
	pragmatically, stating the truth as he sees it.

					WORF
			He will not see tomorrow.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE      39.

59   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			Keep that to yourself. I don't 
			want him to hear that kind of 
			talk.

					WORF
			It does no good to shield him from 
			the truth. Let him prepare for 
			death.

					O'BRIEN
			The hell I will! His only hope is 
			to keep fighting -- if he gives 
			up, it's over.

					WORF
			It was over the moment he was shot 
			by the Jem'Hadar.

	O'Brien is getting really hot -- he takes a step toward 
	Worf.

					O'BRIEN
			You listen to me
				(pointing a finger in
				Worf's chest)
			that boy's life is in our hands 
			and I won't let anybody give 
			up on him.

	O'Brien is in Worf's face, staring at him intently. 
	Worf's eyes narrow a bit, but he holds his temper.

					WORF

				(low)
			Step... back.

	There's a long beat. Finally, O'Brien takes a smart 
	military step backward, letting Worf know that he's 
	not really backing down completely. Dax zips in --

					DAX
			Worf, what do you say we go take 
			a look at the ion exchange matrix 
			we found... and maybe on the way 
			we can discuss some of the finer 
			points of diplomacy.

	Dax leads Worf away, allowing O'Brien to cool down and 
	get back to work.

60   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY


	Muniz is getting worse by the moment. He's now 
	sweating buckets and shivering with a high fever.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE      40.

60   CONTINUED:

	Sisko pats his brow with a wet cloth.

					MUNIZ
			It's so cold here...

	Muniz starts shaking uncontrollably.

					SISKO
			Easy now...

	Suddenly the ship's communicator CHIRPS again.

					KILANA'S VOICE
			Captain Sisko.

	Sisko continues comforting Muniz, ignoring the Vorta's 
	call.

					KILANA'S VOICE
			Captain... you're annoyed with me. 
			I understand. You feel betrayed. 
			And with good reason.

	O'Brien ENTERS and steps up to Muniz, silently 
	indicating to the Captain that he can take over for a 
	moment.

					KILANA'S VOICE
			But I really think we should talk.

	Sisko doesn't respond.

					KILANA'S VOICE
			If it will make you feel better, 
			I'll come unarmed and without an 
			escort.
				(making it tempting)
			But I won't hold you to the same 
			restrictions.

61   EXT. ROCK PLANET - JEM'HADAR SHIP - DAY (OPTICAL)

	Sisko holds a weapon pointed on Kilana. She now shows 
	other sides to her very complicated self. In addition 
	to the "innocent charmer," she now appears contrite 
	and down-to-business.

					SISKO
			You have something to say... say 
			it.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE     40A.

61   CONTINUED:

					KILANA
				(penitent)
			Sending the Jem'Hadar into the 
			ship was a mistake and I 
			apologize. I trust no one was 
			hurt? The last thing I want to do 
			is aggravate the rift between 
			us...

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE      41.

61   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Then a change of gears --

					KILANA
			But what choice did I have? Just 
			like you have to protect the lives 
			of your men... I have to protect 
			our... property. 
				(sincerely)
			But I do hope we can put that 
			behind us and move on.

					SISKO
			Move on to what?

	Kilana allows herself a smile, "grateful" Sisko is 
	agreeing to get past her betrayal.

					KILANA
			I'm sure it's obvious by now that 
			there's something on the ship we 
			want.

	Sisko eyes her without giving away anything.

					KILANA
			You allow me and my men to 
			retrieve the item, and we'll 
			leave.

	Then the "gift," the piece de resistance.

					KILANA
			You can keep the ship.

	But Sisko has a better idea:

					SISKO
			How about this... you tell me what 
			it is you want and I'll bring it 
			out to you.

	Kilana smiles, shakes her head. She acts as if she 
	hadn't ever even considered that possibility...


					KILANA
			I'm afraid I can't do that.

					SISKO
			You don't trust me?

					KILANA
			I'd like to, Captain. But I can't -- 
			not under these circumstances... 
			there's simply too much at stake 
			for us.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE     41A.

61   CONTINUED:	(3)

					SISKO
			We've got a lot at stake, too. I 
			won't risk the lives of my crew.


	Kilana studies Sisko intently, looking for a crack in 
	his resolve. There isn't any.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT THREE      42.


61   CONTINUED:	(4)

					KILANA
			It seems we're approaching an
			impasse.

					SISKO
			I'd say we've arrived.

					KILANA
			How unfortunate.
				(a beat)
			Then negotiations have ended.

	She turns, smiles ruefully and DEMATERIALIZES. A 
	second later, Sisko reacts to a high-pitched SOUND by 
	bolting back to the hull of the ship. Sisko barely 
	makes it into the hull as an EXPLOSION DETONATES 
	offscreen. Worf closes the landing ramp quickly before 
	ANOTHER EXPLOSION detonates.

62   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - CORRIDOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

	Sisko and Worf exchange a look as they brace themselves 
	against the bulkhead as yet ANOTHER EXPLOSION ROCKS the 
	ship.

									FADE OUT.

63   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION rocks the ship as Sisko and Worf 
	ENTER the Command Center.

					DAX
			I take it things could have gone 
			better.

	Sisko looks over to O'Brien, working on an open panel 
	as ANOTHER EXPLOSION shakes the ship.

					O'BRIEN
			All the ship's systems are 
			shutting down, Captain.

	Muniz, semi-conscious, MOANS from the jolt of yet 
	ANOTHER EXPLOSION. O'Brien instinctively starts toward, 
	him.

					SISKO
				(sharp)
			I need to know what's going on out 
			there. Get me some sensor 
			readings, Chief. Dax -- take care 
			of Muniz.

	After a quick glance at Muniz, O'Brien gets back to his work.

64   NEW ANGLE

	as Dax steps over to care for Muniz. Muniz is far 
	gone. His whole side is drenched in blood and his 
	fever has him sweating profusely.

					MUNIZ
			I can't feel my legs...

					DAX
				(gently)
			Don't worry, they're there.

65   ON O'BRIEN


	working on one of the consoles.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       44.

65   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Captain -- I've managed to bypass 
			the virtual display interface and 
			hook up a tricorder to the ship's 
			sensor array.
				(off the tricorder)
			Those are ultritium concussion 
			shells they're detonating.

	Worf steps over to look at the readings.

					DAX
			Without shields, a direct hit will 
			destroy us.

					WORF
			I don't believe they're trying to 
			hit us. Their targeting systems 
			can't be that ineffective. 
			They're missing us on purpose.

					O'BRIEN
			They're trying to rattle us.

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

					SISKO
			And we're not going to let them.

	Sisko thinks,over their situation, trying to see a way 
	out.

					SISKO
			The Vorta doesn't want the ship -- 
			she wants something aboard it.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       45.

65   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			Any idea what?

					SISKO
			Could be anything. An encoding
			device... a guidance system...

					DAX
			Maybe she lost an earring.

					SISKO
			Whatever it is -- it's keeping us
			alive.
				(to Worf and Dax)
			Find it.

	Sisko knows that giving everybody a task is going to 
	help them get through this. Worf and Dax EXIT as Sisko 
	turns to O'Brien.

					SISKO
			Chief -- I need that weapon.

					O'BRIEN
			I still have to charge the emitter
			array.

					SISKO
			Stay on it.

	As O'Brien moves off, Sisko steps over to care for 
	Muniz.

69 INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

	Later. ANOTHER EXPLOSION shakes everything as O'Brien 
	steps down from where he was working and walks over to 
	Sisko.

					O'BRIEN
			You've got your weapon, sir.

					SISKO
			Nice work, Mister O'Brien.

	But O'Brien doesn't look pleased.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       46.

69   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			But the bad news is that the 
			turret is stuck. It can only fire 
			in one direction.

					SISKO
			Well maybe we'll get lucky and 
			the Jem'Hadar will pick that place 
			to stand.

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION. Muniz MOANS. O'Brien looks over at 
	his crewmate. Sisko nods to O'Brien, go ahead.

70   ON O'BRIEN

	stepping up to Muniz, who is lying semi-conscious, his 
	whole side drenched in blood. He restlessly writhes in 
	agony, his fever continuing to climb. ANOTHER VIOLENT 
	EXPLOSION. The sound jolts Muniz awake.

					O'BRIEN
			Easy now... there's nothing to be 
			afraid of.

	Muniz looks sharply in the direction of each explosion. 
	He is soaked from his feverish sweat.

 					MUNIZ
			I'm not afraid, Papa. It's 
			beautiful... precioso.

	Muniz is in another world -- vividly "seeing" a memory 
	from long ago.

					MUNIZ
			Better than last year, don't you 
			think?

	O'Brien looks at him, a bit puzzled.

					MUNIZ
			Los cuehetes... the fireworks of 
			the Carnival. They're terrific, 
			aren't they?

					O'BRIEN
			Easy, Quique.

	But Muniz is too excited, lost in his world. Nothing 
	in the room seems to exist for Muniz except the
	EXPLOSIONS -- which to him are beautiful fireworks.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       47.

70   CONTINUED:

					MUNIZ
			The colors... like a thousand 
			shooting stars.

	A particularly LOUD EXPLOSION. Muniz grins.

					MUNIZ
			That was a good one, eh?

	O'Brien decides the best thing is to go along a little 
	with Muniz's fantasy.

					O'BRIEN
			That was a good one.

71   ON DAX

	ENTERING, carrying a couple of odd-looking isolinear 
	rod-like devices as yet ANOTHER EXPLOSION detonates.

					DAX
			I'll say one thing for the 
			Jem'Hadar... they travel light. 
			There's no cargo... no storage
			compartments...
				(re: the devices)
			I found these data crystals in one 
			of the computer rooms... they may 
			have some encoded information on 
			them... but the crystal structure 
			seems to have been randomized.

					SISKO
			In other words, they're blank.

					DAX
			As far as I can tell. It would 
			help if we knew what we were 
			looking for.

	Sisko looks over the devices as Dax slumps to the 
	ground, tired and frustrated. ANOTHER EXPLOSION 
	strikes.

					SISKO
				(trying to keep his own 
				frustration in check)
			But, we don't.


	After a beat, Sisko steps over to check on Muniz.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       48.

72   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Muniz starts MUTTERING pieces of Spanish... 
	"Lindo"... "que bonita"... "noche"... O'Brien can do 
	nothing but keep Muniz from rocking too violently.

73   ON WORF

	ENTERING with a large box-like console with various 
	dangling plasma conduits -- apparently torn out from 
	the bulkhead. Worf looks over at Muniz, who continues 
	HOLLERING Spanish phrases at the EXPLOSIONS.

					DAX
			What's that?

					WORF
			It may have been the Vorta's 
			computer console. I found it in 
			one of the upper compartments, but 
			the power grid is off-line in that 
			section of the ship...

					DAX
				(smiling)
			So you ripped it out of the wall. 
			Very nice. What do we do with it 
			now? Use it as a doorstop?

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION. Worf slams down the computer 
	terminal onto the floor.

					WORF
				(sharp)
			I don't care what you do with it.

					DAX
			Worf -- I was kidding. It was a 
			good idea. We'll hook it up and 
			see if we can get it working.

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION. A frustrated GROWL escapes his lips 
	as he glares at the walls.

					DAX
			You'd think they'd be tired of 
			playing this game with us by now.

					WORF
			I would like to play a different 
			game with them. If I could just 
			leave this prison... and meet them 
			face-to-face on a field of 
			battle...

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR      48A.

73   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			Right now that doesn't sound like 
			a bad idea.

73A  ANGLE ON DAX

	as she steps over to O'Brien.

					DAX
			Chief, can you take a look at that 
			console?

	O'Brien moves over to the console, Dax stays with Muniz 
	and Sisko. ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       49.

74   ANGLE ON WORF AND O'BRIEN

	as O'Brien checks over the computer console, Worf looks 
	back at Muniz who is MUMBLING feverishly.

					WORF
			That is no way for anyone to die.

					O'BRIEN
			I told you -- he's not going to 
			die.

					WORF
				(adamant)
			It is only a matter of time.


	ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

					O'BRIEN
				(sarcastic)
			So we might as well kill him, 
			right?

					WORF
			If you are truly his friend, you 
			would consider that option. It 
			would be a more honorable death 
			than the one he is enduring.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm not some bloodthirsty Klingon 
			looking for an excuse to murder my 
			friend.

	Sisko calls out --

					SISKO
			That's enough.

	But both Worf's and O'Brien's blood is boiling too high 
	to stop.

					WORF
			No, you're just another weak 
			human, afraid to face death.

	O'Brien takes a SWING at Worf. Worf blocks the punch 
	easily, catching O'Brien's fist and twisting his arm 
	behind him. Worf bares his teeth with a GROWL.

					SISKO
				(loud as hell)
			I said, that's enough!

	Sisko steps between the two men and physically separates them.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       50.

74   CONTINUED:


					SISKO
				(hard)
			You're Starfleet officers. Now 
			start acting like it.

	Worf lets go of O'Brien. Both men let their passions 
	cool in the face of Sisko's fury. A tense moment. Dax 
	tries to break it with:

					DAX
			Tough guys... a little pressure 
			and they buckle.

					SISKO
				(sharp)
			Dax! Maybe you haven't noticed, 
			but no one's laughing.

	Dax instantly realizes she's gone one step over the 
	line. Sisko glowers at his troops. They all look 
	chastened. ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

					SISKO
			I know it's hot. We're filthy. 
			Tired. And we've got ten isotons 
			of explosives going off outside... 
			but we're never going to get out 
			of this if we don't pull it 
			together and act like 
			professionals.

	Muniz lets out a YELL, still lost in his delirium. 
	Sisko has to close his eyes while straining to not snap 
	at the hallucinating crewman. This is a test of his 
	own patience and professionalism.

					SISKO
				(a beat)
			Chief, I want that power grid up 
			and running.

					O'BRIEN
			Aye, sir.


					SISKO
			Worf, see if you can get that 
			turret to rotate.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

					SISKO
			Dax, search the ship again... and 
			again and again until you find 
			what the Vorta wants.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       51.

74   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX
			Aye, sir.

	Everyone breaks up and heads for their tasks. As they 
	move, Sisko steps over to Muniz. He lets out a long 
	breath, looking down at the still delirious man.

					SISKO
			And you, Mister Muniz... 
				(softly)... 
			your orders are to stay alive.

	And as Sisko looks pensively at Muniz.

75   EXT. ROCK PLANET - CRASH SITE - DAY

76   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

	Worf and O'Brien are working on some open console 
	panels, side by side, as Dax straps a semi-conscious 
	Muniz to the bulkhead.

					SISKO (V.O.)
			Chief O'Brien has restored main

	Sisko ENTERS the room.

					O'BRIEN
			As soon as we finish calibrating 
			those induction reactors, we can 
			power up the main core.

	Suddenly ANOTHER EXPLOSION. Sisko and O'Brien exchange 
	a look -- "here we go again."

					SISKO
			Good. Because unless there are 
			any objections, I'd like to get 
			the hell off this planet.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 ACT FOUR        52.

76   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			I'm for that.

	Dax finishes "strapping" Muniz.

					DAX
			Ready, Chief.

	O'Brien also finishes his work. ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

					O'BRIEN
			I'd love a couple more hours to 
			fine tune these magnetic flux 
			couplers... but under the 
			circumstances, I'd say now is as 
			good a time as any.

					SISKO
			Then let's do it.

	Dax, Worf and O'Brien all take their positions, 
	reaching up to the various consoles.

					SISKO
				(taking his own advice)
			Everyone brace yourselves, this is 
			going to be a rough ride.
				(to O'Brien)
			Commence launch sequence.

					WORF
			Ion thrusters fully charged.

	A loud whirling SOUND begins as the ship's engines come 
	on-line. Then, in rapid speech:

					SISKO
				(to Worf)
			Ventral impellers, one quarter.


					WORF
			Plasma compensators, on-line.

					SISKO
			Ascent thrusters to one half.

	The ship starts VIBRATING as the engines kick into 
	gear.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 ACT FOUR        53.

76   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX
			Chief -- I'm getting some low 
			frequency resonance in the main 
			reactor housing.

					O'BRIEN
			That's all right, just keep 
			compensating with the inertial 
			dampers.

					DAX
			Dampers are at maximum.

					WORF
			We need more power.

					SISKO
			Ventral jets to one half.

	The VIBRATING and SHAKING is now VIOLENT.


					DAX
			It's working, captain. These 
			engines just might shake us loose.

77   OMITTED

78   CLOSE ON SISKO

					SISKO
			Increase power to one half.

					DAX
				(concerned)
			Main reactor housing 
			destabilizing.

					WORF
			Reactor containment fields 
			overloading.

	The ship is now VIBRATING so VIOLENTLY that it feels 
	like it's coming apart at the seams.

					O'BRIEN
			Induction dampers disintegrating. 
			captain -- if we don't cut power 
			now we're going to have a core 
			breach.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       54.

79   CLOSE ON SISKO

	staying to the course, calm and controlled while the 
	ship SHAKES ever more VIOLENTLY.

	The vibrating reaches a crescendo. Behind O'Brien, a 
	console EXPLODES with a shower of SPARKS and Sisko is 
	forced to make the inevitable decision.

					SISKO
			Disengage thrusters. Power down 
			all systems.

	As the ship settles back and the VIBRATING stops, 
	there's a moment of relative calm and quiet. It is a 
	moment of undeniable defeat, made worse by ANOTHER 
	EXPLOSION outside -- a grim reminder of their 
	circumstances.

	After a beat, Sisko turns to O'Brien, who is examining 
	the damaged console.

					SISKO
			How bad?

					O'BRIEN
				(downcast)
			The main power grid is completely 
			fused and the structural integrity 
			field has collapsed.

	But Sisko remains undeterred.

					SISKO
			We'll have to wait until the 
			Defiant gets here. She can pull 
			us out with her tractor beam. 
			That gives us thirty-six hours to 
			make repairs.

	Sisko grabs a tool.

					SISKO
			You all know what to do.

	The group breaks apart as they all move on to their 
	tasks.

80   ON O'BRIEN

	as he steps over to Muniz and begins unstrapping him 
	from the "brace."

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       55.

80   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			I could really use your help right 
			now, Quique. I'm surrounded with 
			nothing but officers and you know 
			what they're--

	Once the strap is off Muniz, he slumps to one side... 
	O'Brien stops himself as a dreadful realization comes 
	over him. Muniz is dead. O'Brien tries to swallow 
	back the shock, but a pained GASP escapes his throat. 
	After a long moment...

81   ON SISKO AND DAX

	as they look over to see O'Brien slumping near Muniz 
	and realize what's happened. Dax takes a step toward 
	O'Brien, but Sisko holds her back.

	Worf sees what's occurred and silently looks on.

82   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN

	His face says it all.

83   OMITTED

84   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

	Later. Sisko is alone with his thoughts. Muniz's body
	is gone. Dax ENTERS. ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

					SISKO
			I promised Muniz that he was going 
			to make it.

					DAX
			That's what a captain's supposed 
			to say.

	Dax, tired and at the end of her rope, sits next to 
	Sisko. ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FOUR       56.

84   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I've got to get this ship back to 
			the station, old man. Five people 
			have died on this mission.
				(a beat)
			I want to be able to tell their 
			families why.

	Dax lets out a deep, long breath. After a beat, 
	something off screen catches her eye --

85   DAX'S POV

	of a small droplet that falls to the floor.

					DAX (O.S.)
			Ben...

86   WIDER

	as Sisko and Dax look up to find the source of the 
	dropping liquid.

87   OMITTED

88   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Directly overhead, there's a large, sagging section of 
	the ceiling, almost as if a section of the metal was 
	melting.

	Slowly, the section begins to MELT into watery GOO. 
	Sisko and Dax take a quick step back, drawing their 
	phasers.

					SISKO
			It's a changeling...

	And off their reaction, we:

								FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FOUR

	FADE IN:

89   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY (OPTICAL)

	Moments later. The melting goo on the ceiling suddenly 
	MORPHS into a HALF-FORMED CREATURE -- almost as if the 
	changeling were trying to form itself into several 
	shapes at once.

	With a-frightening ROAR, the creature lashes out at 
	Dax. Sisko pushes Dax out of harm's way and rolls to 
	his side, aiming his phaser at the creature.

	Sisko is about to blast the creature -- when he 
	realizes the changeling can't maintain its form. Sisko 
	and Dax watch the creature as it MORPHS back to its 
	watery, gelatinous goo.

90   ANGLE ON 

	Sisko and Dax lowering their weapons.

					DAX
				(off her tricorder)
			It can't hold its shape. It's 
			dying.

					SISKO
			Then we're in trouble.
				(off her look)
			This is what the Vorta's been 
			looking for. A Founder. No 
			wonder the Jem'Hadar wouldn't
			attack.

					DAX
			They couldn't risk killing one of 
			their gods.

91   ON THE CHANGELING (OPTICAL)

	As the gelatinous goo keeps CHURNING and VIBRATING, it 
	begins EMITTING a piercing, low-toned, ominous HUM, 
	like the keen of a whale.

92   EXT. ROCK PLANET - JEM'HADAR SHIP - DAY

	The HUMMING SOUND echoes as Kilana and three Jem'Hadar 
	warriors stand listening intently to it.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FIVE       58.

92   CONTINUED:

	From their somber expressions, it's clear they all know 
	what this sound is, and they are not happy about it.

93   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

	The sound dies away.

94   ON THE GOO (OPTICAL)

	as it stops VIBRATING and HARDENS into dust. Suddenly, 
	there's complete silence.

					DAX (O.S.)
			The bombing has stopped.

95   WIDER

	as Sisko barks out


					SISKO 
			Prepare for an assault. Have Worf 
			man the turret--

	But before Sisko can complete his orders, Kilana 
	MATERIALIZES a few steps away.

	Sisko and the others instinctively point their weapons 
	at her, expecting her Jem'Hadar soldiers to appear any 
	moment. But she is alone and unarmed. Also gone is 
	her imperious self-assured attitude; she looks somber 
	and defeated. Sisko steps up to her.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FIVE       59.

95   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Where are your soldiers?

					KILANA
			They're dead. They killed themselves.

					DAX
			Why?

					SISKO
				(figuring it out)
			Because they allowed a Founder to 
			die.

	Dax looks to Sisko, who nods. Dax EXITS to check 
	Kilana's story. Kilana looks down at the Founder's 
	remains, clearly devastated.

					KILANA
				(accusatory)
			You should've trusted me.

	Sisko's anger flares.

					SISKO
			How could I? The first thing out
			of your mouth was a lie -- this
			isn't your first mission outside
			the Dominion, is it?

					KILANA
				(contrite)
			I regret saying that.. but my 
			offer was genuine. All that 
			mattered to me was the Founder.

					SISKO
			Then you should've told me about 
			him.

					KILANA
			You might've killed him or taken 
			him hostage...


					SISKO
			No...

	Kilana studies Sisko closely, realizing he's telling 
	the truth.

					SISKO
			All I wanted was the ship.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FIVE      59A.

95   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Kilana shakes her head ruefully...

					KILANA
			And I was willing to let you take 
			it.

	They look at each other... realizing they are each 
	being truthful. A fleeting smile dances across 
	Kilana's mouth.

					KILANA
		And so this is how it ends...

	The two enemies regard each other for a moment as Dax 
	returns.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FIVE       60.

95   CONTINUED: 	(3)

					DAX
			It's true. The Jem'Hadar died by 
			their own hands.

	Now it is Sisko that reflects.

					SISKO
			Muniz... the runabout crew... your 
			soldiers... they'd all still be 
			alive if we'd trusted each other.

	Kilana looks at Sisko without rancor or any hint of a 
	hidden agenda.

					KILANA
			I have no way of stopping you from 
			taking the ship. All I ask is 
			that you allow me to remove the 
			Founder's remains.

	Sisko nods.

					SISKO
			Of course.

	Sisko puts his weapon away and steps aside to let 
	Kilana pass.

96   OMITTED

97   CLOSE ON KILANA

	as she steps up to the remains of the Founder. She 
	tries to hold back her distraught emotions, but a 
	quivering lower lip betrays her feelings.

	She kneels down and takes out a small CEREMONIAL VIAL. 
	She hides her overwhelming sadness with somber, 
	ritualistic motions as she scoops up a small amount of 
	the Founder's dust.

	Sisko watches this at a respectful distance. After a 
	beat, Kilana gets to her feet and prepares to leave. 
	She takes a deep breath, and wipes her watery eyes. 
	Then, steeling herself, she turns to Sisko.

					KILANA
			Do you have any gods, Captain
			Sisko?

					SISKO
			There are things I believe in.

					KILANA
			Duty? Starfleet? The Federation?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FIVE       61.

97   CONTINUED:

	Sisko says nothing.

					KILANA
			Then you must be pleased with 
			yourself. You have the ship to 
			take back to them. 
				(a beat)
			I hope it was worth it.

					SISKO
			So do I.

	Kilana smiles enigmatically at the Captain, and 
	DEMATERIALIZES, leaving Sisko to his thoughts. And on 
	the very pensive captain --

98   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Defiant flies into view with its tractor beam 
	towing the Jem'Hadar warship.

99   INT. DEFIANT - CARGO HOLD

	The body of Muniz lies in a torpedo-like casket. 
	O'Brien sits next to it.

					O'BRIEN
			... we used a phase-conjugate 
			graviton emitter in the tractor 
			beam. That baby came out of the 
			rock on the first try. You 
			would've loved it, Quique...

	O'Brien reacts to a noise offscreen -- he turns to see 
	Worf ENTERING.

					WORF
			I did not mean to interrupt.

					O'BRIEN
			It's all right.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ship" - REV. 07/29/96 - ACT FIVE       62.

99   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			You are performing Ak'voh... for 
			your friend.

					O'BRIEN
			I am?

					WORF
				(nodding)
			An old Klingon tradition. When a 
			warrior dies in battle, his 
			comrades stay with the body to 
			keep away predators. That allows 
			the spirit to leave the body when 
			it is ready for the long journey 
			to Sto'Vo'Kor.

	O'Brien smiles at Worf.

					O'BRIEN
			A fine tradition.

	Worf nods and takes a seat next to O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN
			What are you doing?

					WORF
			We shall both keep the predators 
			away.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm sure Quique would like that.

	And on the image of Worf and O'Brien sitting side by 
	side and gazing at Muniz's "casket," we:
