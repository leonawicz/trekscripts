	FADE IN:

1    INT. QUARK'S

	where BASHIR is sitting at the bar reading a novel on a PADD 
	and sipping COFFEE.  SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.  After a 
	moment, an attractive Bajoran dabo girl, LEETA, approaches.

					LEETA
			Excuse me...

	Bashir looks up, smiles at his visitor.

					LEETA
			You're Doctor Bashir, aren't you?

					BASHIR
			That's right.

					LEETA
			I'm Leeta.  I've been meaning to 
			come by the Infirmary to see you.

	She puts a hand to her mouth and manages to eke out two dainty 
	little coughs.  Bashir is left with the distinct impression 
	that she's just trumping up an excuse to talk with him, and 
	he's more than happy to play along.

             DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - TEASER             2.

1    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			Oh, dear... how long have you had 
			this cough?

					LEETA
			A few days now...

	He stands... reaches to put a hand on her bare back.

					BASHIR
			May I?

	She nods it's all right...

					BASHIR
			Cough for me...

	She performs two more of her cute little coughs...

					BASHIR
			Hmm...

	Leeta looks at him as if gravely concerned.

					LEETA
			Is it serious, Doctor?

					BASHIR
			No... but it's a good thing you came 
			to me when you did...

	Bashir sits her down and signals for the waiter.  As the 
	FERENGI makes his way over...

					BASHIR
			We need to start your treatment right 
			away.
				(to waiter)
			Can I have a Fanalian toddy, very 
			hot.

	The Ferengi nods and starts to move away, but Bashir stops 
	him.

					BASHIR
			Make that two...
				(off Leeta's look)
			I've been feeling a bit of a cough 
			coming on myself...

	They both know full well this isn't true, but the rules of 
	this particular flirtation dictate that they play along...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - TEASER           3.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					LEETA
			I'm sorry to hear that, Doctor.

					BASHIR
			Please... call me --

					DAX (O.S.)
			Julian.

	Bashir turns to see DAX standing at his side with a smile on 
	her face.  Bashir gives her a cursory greeting.

					BASHIR
			Hi...

	When he fails to introduce her, Dax introduces herself.

					DAX
				(to Leeta)
			I'm Jadzia...

					LEETA
				(friendly)
			Leeta...

	Bashir can see Dax is about to join them, he suddenly starts 
	to work his PADD.

					BASHIR
				(to Dax)
			Before I forget, here's the 
			immunological data you asked for...

	Before she can ask what he's talking about, he hands her the 
	PADD.  Puzzled, Dax looks down at the screen.

1A   INSERT - THE PADD

	where the words GO AWAY are clearly written.

1B   RESUME SCENE

	as Dax realizes he wants her to leave.

					DAX
				(wry)
			How sweet of you to put this together 
			for me so quickly...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - TEASER           4.

1B   CONTINUED:

					DAX (Cont'd)
				(beat)
			I think I'll go look it over right 
			now...

	She nods a goodbye to Leeta and starts to leave, then seems 
	to remember something, turns back to Bashir.  Though 
	pretending to be relaying some casual information, there's a 
	mischievous quality to her as she does so.

					DAX
			Oh, by the way... I just heard the 
			Lexington is going to be docking 
			here for a few days...

	Bashir seems almost stricken to hear this.

					BASHIR
			The Lexington... ?

	But before he can recover enough to ask her to clarify, Dax 
	EXITS to the Promenade.  Bashir considers for a beat, then:

					BASHIR
				(to Leeta)
			Excuse me for just one second.

	And with that, he leaves a baffled looking Leeta behind and 
	follows Dax out into:

2    INT. PROMENADE

	as Bashir catches up with Dax.  SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.

					BASHIR
			Jadzia...

	Dax turns and sees him...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/06/95 - TEASER           5.

2    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			Do you happen to know when the 
			Lexington is coming?

					DAX
			Three weeks.
				(beat)
			Don't you have a friend aboard?

	Bashir makes a show of thinking it over.

					BASHIR
			Do I... ?

					DAX
			The medical officer... Elizabeth 
			Lense...

					BASHIR
				(as if trying to 
				remember)
			Elizabeth Lense... I think she may 
			have been in my class at Starfleet 
			Medical.

					DAX
			Wasn't she the valedictorian?

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - TEASER           6.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			That's right...

					DAX
			And you were... salutatorian?

					BASHIR
				(nods)
			Second in my class...
				(minimizing it)
			If I hadn't mistaken a pre-ganglionic 
			fiber --

					DAX
			For a post-ganglionic nerve, I know.

					BASHIR
				(trying to shrug it 
				off)
			I would've been valedictorian.

					DAX
				(equally dismissive)
			Oh, well...
				(beat; brightly)
			You must really be looking forward 
			to seeing her...

	Bashir puts his best face forward.

					BASHIR
			I can hardly wait.
				(beat)
			I'd better get back to Leeta...

	And with that, he turns and heads off in the wrong direction, 
	away from Quark's.  He's so distracted he doesn't even 
	realize.

					DAX
			Julian... ?
				(gesturing)
			That way.

	He nods and moves away... off Dax's bemused expression...

	Establishing.

4    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	where JAKE is standing by the window looking out at the stars, 
	lost in thought.  He paces a bit as if trying to work 
	something out, seems to get an idea, then moves over to the 
	table where he has a PADD.  He picks it up, starts working 
	it in a definitive manner... after a beat, the door OPENS 
	and SISKO ENTERS carrying a SATCHEL.  He seems upbeat, 
	excited, and is sporting a week-old beard.

					SISKO
			Jake!

	Jake reacts as if he'd rather not have his dad see what he 
	was working on.

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - TEASER           7.

4    CONTINUED:

					JAKE
			Hey, Dad.

	Jake stands to greet his father, and in a casual but 
	deliberate move, tosses the PADD face down onto a nearby 
	chair.  Jake notices his Dad's beard for the first time.

					JAKE
			What's this?

					SISKO
			I just thought it was time for a 
			change...
				(stroking it)
			What do you think?

					JAKE
			I like it.
				(beat)
			How was Bajor?

					SISKO
			Beautiful, you should've come with 
			me.

					JAKE
			The re-opening of some old Library 
			isn't exactly my idea of a good time.

					SISKO
			This wasn't just any old Library... 
			we're talking about the most extensive 
			collection of Bajoran antiquities on 
			the planet.  I saw manuscripts that 
			date back to before the Fall of the 
			First Republic.

					JAKE
				(less than enthused)
			Great...

					SISKO
			Look at this...

	Sisko takes a PADD from his satchel and shows it to Jake.

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - TEASER          7A.

5    INSERT - THE PADD

	where we see a blueprint of some kind, though it should be 
	hard for us to tell what exactly we're looking at.


6    RESUME SCENE

					JAKE
			What is it, some kind of ship?

             DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - TEASER             8.

6    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			According to legend, the ancient 
			Bajorans used ships like these to 
			explore their star system... eight 
			hundred years ago...

					JAKE
				(impressed)
			You mean that when humans were first 
			sailing across the oceans, Bajorans 
			were already going to other planets?

					SISKO
			Some scholars think they made it all 
			the way to Cardassia...

					JAKE
				(studying the PADD)
			Seems hard to believe... what are 
			these?

					SISKO
			Solar sails... these ships were 
			propelled by light pressure...

					JAKE
				(intrigued)
			Like a sailboat catching the wind...

					SISKO
			Exactly...

	Jake studies the PADD for a beat...

					JAKE
			I wonder if a ship like this could 
			really fly... ?

					SISKO
			I don't know... that's why I'm going 
			to build one...

	Off Sisko's smile and Jake's reaction, we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

7    INT. CARGO BAY

	as Sisko ENTERS at a brisk clip, followed by KIRA and O'BRIEN.

					SISKO
			-- I'm expecting a lumber shipment 
			from Bajor this afternoon.

					O'BRIEN
				(struck by this odd 
				request)
			Okay...

					SISKO
			Which reminds me... I'll also need a 
			saber saw.

					O'BRIEN
			A saber saw?

					SISKO
			You know... to cut wood.

					O'BRIEN
			Why not use a laser cutter?

					SISKO
			Because I want to use the same types 
			of tools the Bajorans had.

	O'Brien and Kira exchange a look as Sisko looks around the 
	room.

					SISKO
			This should do fine, Major... As 
			soon as these cargo containers are 
			out of the way, I'll start 
			construction.

	O'Brien looks down at the PADD he's holding.

					O'BRIEN
			Sir, I've looked over the 
			specifications you brought back from 
			Bajor...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT ONE         9A.

7    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			... I'm not sure the design is 
			spaceworthy, and I'm positive a ship 
			like this couldn't have made it from 
			Bajor to Cardassia.

					KIRA
				(disagreeing)
			Why do you say that?

					O'BRIEN
			At sublight speeds, the trip would've 
			taken them years, and that's assuming 
			ideal conditions.  One unexpected 
			ion storm in the Denorias Belt 
			would've torn the sails to pieces 
			and left them stranded.

					KIRA
			Well maybe they were lucky and didn't 
			run into any storms.

            DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - ACT ONE            10.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			I just don't see how a ship like 
			this could've made the trip.  They 
			didn't even have replicators back 
			then... they would've had to store 
			their air supply...
				(indicates PADD)
			-- and there's only enough room  
			onboard for a few weeks worth.

					KIRA
			Maybe they recycled it somehow... 
			using some kind of photosynthetic 
			plant.

					O'BRIEN
				(politely skeptical)
			Maybe...

					KIRA
			You sound like a Cardassian...

					O'BRIEN
				(bristling)
			I beg your pardon?

					KIRA
			They've denied the possibility of 
			ancient contact for decades because 
			they can't stand the idea that Bajor 
			had interstellar flight before they 
			did.

					O'BRIEN
			With all due respect, Major... you're 
			beginning to sound like a Romulan.

					KIRA
			A Romulan?

					O'BRIEN
			There's no piece of technology in 
			existence that they don't claim they 
			invented before everyone else...

	Sisko smiles and decides to intervene.

					SISKO
			Look... I'm not planning to spend 
			the next few years sailing to 
			Cardassia... I just want to build 
			one of these ships and prove that 
			it's spaceworthy...

            DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - ACT ONE            11.


					O'BRIEN
			A computer model could do that... 
			why go to all the trouble?

	Sisko turns and looks at O'Brien...

					SISKO
			Why?
				(smiles)
			Because it'll be fun...

	Sisko turns away to case out the room, and his colleagues 
	exchange looks... they haven't seen their commander this 
	excited about something in a long time...

8    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

9    INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)

	A MONTAGE showing Sisko working... welding pieces of metal 
	together, fitting glass, etc.  He's wearing a workman's 
	jumpsuit, and in some shots a welder's mask.  He seems like 
	the happiest man alive...

10   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Where Jake and Sisko are having dinner.  Sisko is in his 
	workman's jumpsuit, now stained and worn.

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT ONE         12.

10   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I've been thinking... according to 
			the star charts, the most difficult 
			part of the trip between Bajor and 
			Cardassia would be getting through 
			the Denorias Belt.  After that, it 
			would be smooth sailing the rest of 
			the way.

	Jake isn't terribly interested, he's just being polite.

					JAKE
			Really...

					SISKO
			Just being able to make that part of 
			the trip would go a long way toward 
			demonstrating that the Bajorans could 
			have made the journey to Cardassia.

					JAKE
			Seems reasonable...

	Sisko starts fishing here to see if Jake might be interested 
	in coming along.

					SISKO
			It would only take about... four, 
			five days...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT ONE         13.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

					JAKE
			That's not so long...

					SISKO
			So...

					JAKE
				(unsure)
			What?

					SISKO
			What do you say you come with me?  
			We'll have a great time.  The ship'll 
			be ready to go in another week.

					JAKE
			I don't know, Dad... Nog's birthday 
			is next week... I promised I'd do 
			something with him.

					SISKO
			All right.  We can do it after his 
			birthday.

					JAKE
				(grasping)
			That's when Leanne is supposed to 
			get back from Bajor.  I really want 
			to see her, and I don't know how 
			long she's going to be here.

	Sisko realizes Jake is making excuses.  He's a little hurt, 
	but doesn't push his son.

					SISKO
			Oh... well... if you can't do it, 
			you can't do it.

					JAKE
			I'd like to, but... it's just not 
			good timing, you know?

	Sisko is disappointed but tries not to show it.

					SISKO
			Sure.  I understand.

      DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/06/95 - ACT ONE 14-15.         

10   CONTINUED:	(3)

	They fall into silence for a few moments and eat, each alone 
	with their thoughts... off this moment...

11   INT. REPLIMAT

	where Bashir is having COFFEE at a table, reading over a 
	medical journal on a PADD.  After a moment, Dax approaches 
	carrying a raktajino and reads over his shoulder:

					DAX
				(reading)
			A survey of Cygnian Respiratory 
			diseases...
				(wry)
			Fascinating...

	Bashir realizes she's on to him, admits it.

					BASHIR
			I'm reading everything I can get my 
			hands on so I won't be caught flat-
			footed by the intrepid Doctor Lense.  
			It's useless, of course... she's 
			probably discovered the cure to aging 
			by now...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/02/95 - ACT ONE         16.

11   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			I take it the two of you were... 
			competitive.

					BASHIR
			Absolutely.  We were neck and neck 
			right up to the final exam.  And 
			then I blew it.
				(a beat)
			And that's how she wound up on the 
			Lexington.  A post virtually everyone 
			in our graduating class was hoping 
			for.

					DAX
			Including you?

					BASHIR
			No, this is the assignment I wanted.

					DAX
			Then what does it matter?

					BASHIR
			Don't you see?  She could've had 
			this post, she could've taken it 
			from me.  Somehow... no matter what 
			I accomplish while I'm here, that'll 
			always make me feel... second best...

	And with that, Bashir turns and EXITS to the Promenade... 
	leaving Dax to wonder if maybe she should stop teasing him 
	so much...

12   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	where Sisko is using a BAJORAN LASER TORCH to weld together 
	a winch that's used to trim the sails.  The ship's interior 
	has taken shape around him.  The walls and floor reflect the 
	gentle, graceful curves of the exterior design.  Compressed 
	air tanks are built into the walls, and in places we get a 
	suggestion of their existence.  There might be little nooks 
	and ledges formed where the walls and floor meet, places a 
	person might perch themselves to read.

	Because this was a zero-gravity ship, the ceiling is quite 
	low, and like the walls and floor, there are handles on it 
	for the crew to grab onto.

	The interior has an almost Jules Verne feel to it.

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT ONE        16A.

12   CONTINUED:

	You can see it in the ornate details worked into the 
	bulkhead, the use of rich woods, the pipes and valve 
	assemblies that emerge from the bolted iron walls, the analog 
	gauges, the portholes (which are placed not just in the 
	walls, but in the floor and ceiling as well).

	Much of the wall space is taken up by four winch assemblies 
	that occupy each corner of the room.  These extend from floor 
	to ceiling and are used to control the sails; they consist 
	of gauges, cranks, gears and levers.

	There's a table against one wall for reading star charts, 
	with a rack for holding the rolled up charts.  A complex 
	looking SEXTANT hangs from the ceiling near the portholes.

	Because the crew needs to be able to move unencumbered around 
	the cabin to work the winches, there are no chairs or beds.  
	When it comes time to sit or sleep, the crew will use pillows 
	or string up a hammock.  A door in one wall leads to the 
	head... and against another wall there's a small zero-gravity 
	GALLEY.

	After a moment, Dax peers through one of the windows, then 
	ENTERS through the opening where a door will eventually be.  
	She's carrying a "picnic basket" with food.

					DAX
			Hi...

	Sisko looks up briefly from his work.

					SISKO
			Come on in...

					DAX
			I brought you something to eat...

					SISKO
			Thanks... let me just finish welding 
			this and I'll take a break.

	Dax sets the basket down, looks around.  She's struck by the 
	unusual design and the fine craftsmanship that went into 
	executing it.

					DAX
			Benjamin... I can't believe the work 
			you've put into this...

					SISKO
				(modestly)
			I'm just following the blueprints...

					DAX
				(touching a carved 
				surface)
			But you didn't have to bother with 
			detail like this to prove the ship 
			is spaceworthy.

	Sisko sets down the welder, moves to join her.

					SISKO
			I suppose not... but I want everything 
			to be just right... it's an exact 
			replica...
				(admitting it)
			Except for the gravity net I installed 
			in the floor... weightlessness makes 
			me queasy...

	Dax sees how happy he seems and can't help but smile.  
	She starts pulling food and drink from the basket.

					DAX
			I haven't seen you like this in a 
			long time...

					SISKO
			Like what?

					DAX
			So caught up in something... so 
			excited...
				(considers)
			Not since... not since you and 
			Jennifer decided to have a baby.

	Sisko smiles self-deprecatingly...

					SISKO
			The nursery...

					DAX
			I don't think anyone's ever put more 
			effort into making a room for their 
			baby...

					SISKO
			But you have to admit it turned out 
			pretty well...

					DAX
			Especially the starscape on the 
			ceiling...

					SISKO
			Jake loved that ceiling... when we 
			moved out of the house, he couldn't 
			understand why we couldn't bring it 
			with us.

	A quiet moment...

					DAX
			You're disappointed he's not going 
			with you on this trip, Aren't you?

					SISKO
			He's got other things he'd rather be 
			doing, friends he'd rather spend 
			time with.

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT ONE         19.

12   CONTINUED:	(4)

					SISKO
				(considers)
			It's funny... a year or two ago, 
			nothing would've stopped him from 
			coming with me on an adventure like 
			this.
				(with regret)
			I guess I waited too long...

	There's a quiet moment between them...

					DAX
			You'll have other adventures together, 
			Benjamin... they'll just be different.  
			Believe me, I know.  I've been a 
			father a couple of times, myself.
				(thinking back)
			I could tell you stories...

					SISKO
				(smiling)
			You already have...

					DAX
			That's right... I have, haven't I?
				(shrugs)
			Then you know I'm right.

	And with a smile of encouragement she EXITS; Sisko picks up 
	the welder to resume work... but we can see that he's still 
	troubled...

13   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	as Jake ENTERS from the corridor with the air of a person 
	glad to be home after being gone for a few hours.

					JAKE
			Computer...

	We hear the SOUND of the Computer engaging.

					JAKE
			Are there any messages for me?

					COMPUTER VOICE
			One... a communication from 
			Wellington, New Zealand.

	Jake moves toward the computer monitor.

					JAKE
			Display it on screen...

	As Jake reads off the screen we first get the impression 
	that he's received some surprising but welcome news... after 
	a moment, however, a look of concern crosses his features...

	Sisko turns and sees him.

					SISKO
			Jake...

					JAKE
			Hey, Dad...

	Sisko gestures around the cabin with a smile of pride.

					SISKO
			So what do you think?

					JAKE
			It's terrific... maybe a little small 
			for two people... but I think I could 
			get used to it.

	Sisko reacts, unsure what Jake means...

					JAKE
			That is, if you still want me along.

	He breaks into a broad grin... after a beat, Sisko returns

16   INT. OPS

	as Sisko and Kira EXIT from his office.  He's in CIVILIAN 
	CLOTHES, carrying a duffel BAG, and is giving his last orders 
	before departing.

					SISKO
				(remembering)
			I'm expecting a report from Starfleet 
			Command.  You'd better relay it to 
			me aboard the Baraka as soon as it 
			comes in.

					KIRA
			The Baraka... ?

					SISKO
			That's what I named the ship... it's 
			Swahili for "good fortune"...

	Kira smiles appreciatively.  Suddenly Dax turns from her 
	console.

					DAX
			Benjamin, there's an incoming message 
			from Gul Dukat... he says it's urgent 
			he speak with you.

					SISKO
				(gesturing to his

			Patch it through to my office...

	As Sisko EXITS to his office, Kira and Dax share a look of 
	concern...

17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	where Sisko is talking with GUL DUKAT on a MONITOR.  Their 
	conversation has a veneer of civility, but they're gauging 
	each other's motives the whole time.

					DUKAT
			I understand you're planning a trip.

					SISKO
			Word gets around.

					DUKAT
			I can't believe that a man of your 
			intelligence would take stock in 
			Bajoran fairy tales about ancient 
			contact.

					SISKO
			If you recall, you thought the 
			Celestial Temple was a Bajoran fairy 
			tale...
				(a small smile)
			-- until we discovered the wormhole.

	Dukat gives Sisko a cold look.

					DUKAT
			I suggest you reconsider your plans; 
			solar vessels are very fragile, and 
			it's a long way to the Denorias Belt 
			at sublight speeds...

					SISKO
			Don't worry.  I'll have emergency 
			equipment aboard.  If something goes 
			wrong, Major Kira can get a runabout 
			to me within an hour.

					DUKAT
			An hour can be a long time... 
			especially if you happen to encounter 
			something unexpected.

					SISKO
			Like what?

					DUKAT
			Oh, I don't know.  A Maquis ship, 
			perhaps...

          DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT TWO         24.

17   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Why would the Maquis have any quarrel 
			with an unarmed ship sailing toward 
			the Denorias Belt... they have nothing 
			at stake here, nothing to prove... 
			or should I say, disprove.

					DUKAT
			Commander, I contacted you out of 
			concern for your safety, but you 
			seem to be intimating that I've made 
			some sort of threat.

					SISKO
			I'm glad I was wrong.  For a moment 
			there I thought you'd been put in 
			charge of the Cardassian Ministry 
			for the Refutation of Bajoran 
			Fairy Tales...

	Dukat stiffens...

					DUKAT
			Since I don't seem to have dissuaded 
			you from undertaking this little 
			voyage of yours, I'll wish you luck 
			instead.  Let's hope you don't need 
			it.

	And with that, Dukat terminates the transmission.  Off Sisko's

	Sisko mans a different winch assembly...

					SISKO
			Let's do it...

	The two men start cranking away... it's not easy, but they 
	both seem to be enjoying the exertion...

					SISKO
			Keep at it, nice and steady...

	Sisko moves to a different winch and starts cranking...

20   EXT. SPACE - BAJORAN SHIP (OPTICAL)

	as the two main sails unfurl from the capsule.

21   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	as the Siskos crank away... the cabin shifts unpredictably

	it won't go any further.

					JAKE
			That's as far as it'll go...

					SISKO
			Okay...
				(indicating another 
				winch)
			I'll work on the spritsails while 
			you deploy the jib...

	Jake moves to the winch indicated by Sisko and gets to work... 
	Sisko takes another winch...

					SISKO

			Put your back into it...

	Jake redoubles his efforts...

26   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	where Sisko is looking out one of the portholes through the 
	sextant... Jake is unrolling a star chart and fastening it 
	to the table using the clamps that run along its sides.

					SISKO
				(off sextant reading)
			Jake, trim the starboard sprit by 
			about six degrees...

	Jake takes a crank handle and complies... Sisko looks out a 
	nearby porthole at the sail... 

					JAKE
			O.K.  How's that?

					SISKO
			That should do it... we'll start 
			picking up speed as the pressure on 
			the sails builds...

	Sisko swings the sextant around to the other porthole and 
	takes another reading.  Meanwhile, Jake takes a look around 
	the room...

					JAKE
			Hey, Dad... where do we sleep?

					SISKO
				(as he works)
			There are hammocks we can string up 
			later...

	Jake nods, moves to open the door to the bathroom.  Though 
	Jake's body blocks most of our view, we can see that it's 
	tiny, barely large enough to stand in.

					JAKE
			This is the bathroom?

					SISKO
			It was designed for a zero-gravity 
			environment...

					JAKE
				(at a loss)
			How do you...

           DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - ACT THREE           28.

26   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			You'll get the hang of it...

	Sisko finishes his readings, cranks a winch a few turns, and 
	moves to look at the star chart.  Using nautical-looking 
	NAVIGATIONAL TOOLS (a parallel ruler, a compass, etc), he 
	works out their flight plan as Jake watches...

					SISKO
			We'll be tacking against the light 
			most of the way... we'll run like 
			this for the next ninety minutes or 
			so... then we'll come about and I'll 
			calculate our next leg...

	Jake takes this in, fascinated...

					SISKO
			How about something to drink... ?

	Sisko goes to the galley and takes out two POUCHES of water, 
	tosses one to Jake.  Jake reacts to the zero-gravity ration...

					JAKE
			Don't tell me we only have zero-
			gravity rations...

					SISKO
				(lightly)
			That's all the ancient Bajorans had...

	Sisko settles onto the floor, his back against the wall, 
	lets out a contented breath.  Jake settles onto the floor 
	nearby.  After a quiet moment...

					SISKO
			Listen...

	Jake cocks his ear for a moment...

					JAKE
			I don't hear anything...

					SISKO
			Exactly... not even the hum of an 
			engine...

	Sisko smiles to himself, caught up for a moment in the romance 
	of sailing...

			Imagine what the ancient Bajorans 
			must've felt... heading out into 
			space in ships like this one... not 
			knowing what they would find... or

	Jake is looking at his father, glad to see him swept up in 
	something... Sisko looks at him for a quiet moment...

					SISKO
			Jake... I know you didn't really 
			want to come on this trip...

	Jake starts to protest but Sisko holds up a hand to stop 
	him.

					SISKO
			I just want to say I'm glad you're 
			here...

	A moment between father and son...

					JAKE
			Dad... there's something I need to 
			talk to you about...

					SISKO
			Sure, what is it?

	Jake stands to go get his duffel bag and remove a PADD from 
	it.

					JAKE
			First you should read this...

	This is a difficult moment for him, as if he's both proud of 
	something and yet embarrassed by it.  He activates the PADD 
	and hands it to his father.

					JAKE
			It's a story I wrote...

	Jake smiles, a little embarrassed over being caught.

					SISKO
			If you keep an eye on the rigging, 
			I'll read it right now...

					JAKE
				(smiles)
			Deal...

	Sisko moves to sit on one of the nooks formed by the bulkhead 
	where the floor and wall meet.  As Jake mans the rig, he 
	casts a couple glances over at his father, who's now absorbed 
	in the PADD... will he like it... ?

	Bashir glances over toward another table, where we see DOCTOR 
	ELIZABETH LENSE talking with two other officers from the

					BASHIR
			She's busy...

	O'Brien rolls his eyes.  QUARK suddenly appears at their

			You never mentioned she was

	Bashir can't believe Quark knows about her too.

					BASHIR
				(sharp)

	Quark smiles awkwardly and takes his leave... O'Brien sees 
	that Lense and her colleagues are saying goodbye...

					O'BRIEN
			She's getting up...

	O'Brien gives him a reassuring pat on the back.  Bashir sees 
	that she's going to pass near their table as she heads for 
	the exit.  He straightens his uniform, frames a smile on his 
	face, and times standing up so that they'll just "happen" to 
	run into each other.

	She approaches, gets closer... Bashir acts as if he just saw 
	her, breaks into a grin... she looks right at him... and

	something he reads, and Jake just stares at him, trying to 
	guess what it might be.

	After another moment, Sisko looks up at his son.  Jake meets

					JAKE
			Yeah... I guess he could wait until

					SISKO
			That'd be more believable.

			So you really think it was good,

	Jake's features falter, he isn't quite sure how to take this.

					JAKE

	not to say something...

					JAKE
			What I mean is... yesterday I got a 
			communication from the Pennington 
			School in New Zealand... they offered

	Sisko couldn't be more taken by surprise.  He's both proud

					SISKO
			That's terrific, Jake... I... didn't

					JAKE
			I didn't really.  What happened is, 
			I showed a story I wrote to Mrs. 
			O'Brien... I guess she liked it 
			because she showed it to a friend of 
			hers who knows someone at the school 
			and --

	Jake is cut off when one of the winches suddenly groans and 
	gives way... it starts to UNCRANK rapidly, and just as Sisko 
	hurries toward it the ship suddenly leans hard to one side, 
	throwing him against the bulkhead...

31A  EXT. SPACE - BAJORAN SHIP (OPTICAL)
	(FORMERLY SCENE 32)

	The starboard spritsail is askew so that it's now 
	roughly perpendicular to and partially blocking the 
	starboard mainsail.

	Off this moment we...

									FADE OUT.

33   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	where Sisko and Jake are struggling to get the craft under 
	control.  The problem with the sails is causing the ship to 
	shift unpredictably, making their task that much more 
	complicated...

	Sisko is appraising the situation through one of the small 
	portholes that look out onto the sail...

					SISKO
			A mast support gave way... the 
			starboard sprit is fouling one of 
			the mainsails...

					JAKE
			Can we fix it... ?

					SISKO
			I don't think so... we're going to 
			have to jettison the sprit...

	Sisko moves to one of the winches, gestures that Jake should 
	go to another...

					SISKO
			Let's fall off a little... take some 
			pressure off the sails...

	Jake lets the crank unwind, and the cabin rights itself to a 
	certain extent.  Sisko starts cranking hard, straining against 
	the pressure...

					SISKO
				(straining)
			Lock it down and give me a hand...

	Jake hurries to his father's side and throws his weight 
	against the crank... they manage to move it a bit... then a 
	little more...

					SISKO
				(straining)
			One more turn...

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT FOUR         36.

33   CONTINUED:

	And with one last burst of effort they get it...

					SISKO
			Good work...

	Sisko moves to a control panel and works it...

					SISKO
			All right... I'm going to jettison 
			the sprit...

34   EXT. SPACE - BAJORAN SHIP (OPTICAL)

	as a small charge DETONATES at the base of the starboard 
	sprit, snapping the support and sending the sail away from 
	the ship... as it starts to tumble away we cut back into...

35   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	Sisko moves to a porthole, peers up at the sail.

					SISKO
			That's better... but it looks like 
			we're getting a lot of spill off the 
			sails... we won't make as much headway 
			on each tack...

	He turns to Jake, lays it on the line for him.

					SISKO
			I don't know if we'll be able to get 
			to the Denorias Belt like this.

	But Jake refuses to give up so easily...

					JAKE
			The ancient Bajorans probably ran 
			into these kinds of problems, too.

					SISKO
			I suppose they did.

					JAKE
			Did they give up and go home?

					SISKO
			Seems to me we're here to prove they 
			didn't.

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/01/95 - ACT FOUR         37.

35   CONTINUED:

	They're both in agreement that they should press on, and 
	this act of resolve is energizing to both.

					JAKE
			Then what are we waiting for?

					SISKO
			Let's get to work.

	Sisko gestures to a winch and takes another himself.  When 
	they're in position...

					SISKO
			Coming about...

	They both start cranking away, and as the cabin tilts to 
	reflect the course change we cut out...

37   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS

	Bashir, O'Brien, and a half-empty bottle of scotch.

	Bashir, who is drunker than O'Brien, is visibly moved by the 
	song...

					BASHIR
			That was beautiful, Chief... just 
			beautiful.  You know what we should 
			do... ?

					O'BRIEN
			What?

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 02/28/95 - ACT FOUR        37A.

					BASHIR
			Go to Quark's... and sing it for

	O'Brien is sober enough to see this is a bad idea...

37   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			Maybe we should switch to synthale...

					BASHIR
			No... this isn't a synthale kind of 
			night...
				(somber)
			She walked right by me, Chief.  Acted 
			like I wasn't even there.

					O'BRIEN
			You know what I think... I think 
			she's in love with you...

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/06/95 - ACT FOUR         39.

37   CONTINUED:	(3)

	A beat as Bashir considers this unlikely thought.

					BASHIR
			I don't think so.

					O'BRIEN
			It's the only explanation.
				(considers)
			Unless of course, she ignored you 
			because she can't stand you.

					BASHIR
				(hopeful)
			Isn't there an explanation somewhere 
			in between?

					O'BRIEN
			You're not an in-between kind of 
			guy.

					BASHIR
			What do you mean?

					O'BRIEN
			People either love you or hate you.

					BASHIR
			Really?

					O'BRIEN
			I hated you when we first met.

            DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - ACT FOUR           40.

37   CONTINUED:	(4)

					BASHIR
			I remember.

					O'BRIEN
			But now...

	Bashir waits for O'Brien to finish the sentiment, but he 
	doesn't continue...

					BASHIR
			But now... ?

					O'BRIEN
			Now...
				(can't quite bring 
				himself to say it)
			I don't.

	Bashir reacts as if O'Brien had just come out and told him 
	that now he loved him.

					BASHIR
				(sincere)
			That means a lot to me, Chief, it 
			really does...

					O'BRIEN
			That's from the heart, too... I really 
			do...
				(tripping on it again)
			-- not hate you anymore...

	A warm moment between them.

					O'BRIEN
			If you want to find out why she 
			ignored you, you're going to have to 
			confront her.

					BASHIR
			You're right...
				(stands)
			I'm going to go up to her and ask 
			her flat out where she gets off 
			walking past me like that.

	He heads for the door as if intending to do it now, but 
	O'Brien stops him.

					O'BRIEN
			Better wait until tomorrow...

					BASHIR
			Why should I?  Why not right now?

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/01/95 - ACT FOUR         41.

37   CONTINUED:	(5)

					O'BRIEN
			Because right now you can barely 
			stand up.

	Bashir considers for a beat, then agrees.

					BASHIR
			Good point.

	O'Brien gives him a mischievous smile, then begins to softly 
	sing...

					O'BRIEN
			And did those feet in an-cient 
			time...
			Walk up-on Eng-land's moun-tains

	Bashir joins in...

	As they continue the song we...

									CUT TO:

38   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	Sisko and Jake are still hard at work, now manning different 
	winches from before.  Jake seems winded, near exhaustion.  
	Sisko is looking up at the sails through a porthole...

					SISKO
			This'll be the last time we have to 
			come about for a while...

					JAKE
			Good.

					SISKO
			Ready... ?
				(off Jake's nod)
			Now...

	They start working their winches and the craft starts to 
	come around... they work for a few moments, then Sisko moves 
	to a different winch, checks the sail through a porthole, 
	and makes a few adjustments...

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/06/95 - ACT FOUR        41A.

38   CONTINUED:

	When he's done, he gives Jake a reassuring slap on the  
	shoulder.

					SISKO
			Nice job.  Come on...

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/13/95 - ACT FOUR         42.

38   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			Let's set up the hammock and take a 
			break...


	They quickly string up the hammock, and Sisko motions to 
	Jake...

					SISKO
			Hop in...

	Jake crawls inside the hammock...

					JAKE
			Not bad...

	Sisko smiles, after a moment...

					SISKO
			So, I suppose congratulations are in 
			order.  Pennington's a good school... 
			very competitive...

					JAKE
			Dad, before you say anything... I'm 
			turning down the Fellowship...

	Sisko is surprised to hear this...

					SISKO
			Turning it down... why?

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/13/95 - ACT FOUR         43.

38   CONTINUED:	(3)

					JAKE
			I'm just... not ready to go.

	Sisko considers for a moment... his first thought is that 
	Jake isn't going because he's afraid to leave the security 
	of home...

					SISKO
			Jake, an opportunity like this doesn't 
			come along every day...

					JAKE
			I can defer admission for a year.  
			If I want to go then, I still can.

					SISKO
			That's great, but... why would things 
			be any different in a year?

	The question seems to make Jake uncomfortable.

					JAKE
			I don't know... they just might be, 
			that's all.

	Sisko sees that Jake seems uncomfortable... he considers how 
	best to advise his son.

					SISKO
			You know... I wasn't much older than 
			you are when I left for San Francisco 
			to go to Starfleet Academy.  For the 
			first few days, I was so homesick I 
			went back to my house in New Orleans 
			every night for dinner.

	Sisko smiles as he remembers.

					SISKO
			I'd materialize in the living room 
			at six-thirty and take my seat at 
			the table like I'd just come down 
			the stairs...

            DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - ACT FOUR           44.

38   CONTINUED:	(4)

					JAKE
			You must've used up a month's worth 
			of Transporter Credits...

					SISKO
			My parents... they never said anything 
			about it... just "How you doing, 
			son, how was school today?" They 
			knew I'd get over being homesick 
			soon enough, and they were right.  
			By the third or fourth day, you 
			couldn't have pried me away from the 
			campus.

	Jake smiles at his father's story...

					SISKO
			Of course... if you go to Pennington, 
			you won't be able to beam back to 
			the station to have dinner with your 
			old man, but after a week or so, 
			you'll get over it...

	Jake sits up in the hammock, he isn't quite sure how to say 
	this.

					JAKE
			Dad, it's not me I'm worried about... 
			it's you.

					SISKO
			Me?

					JAKE
			If I go, you'll be all alone...

	Sisko is touched by his son's concern, even though he doesn't 
	share it...

					SISKO
			Jake, I appreciate you thinking about 
			me... but don't turn down this 
			opportunity on my account.  I'll 
			have plenty of people to keep me 
			company.  I can have dinner with 
			Dax, or Doctor Bashir... even Quark.

					JAKE
				(unconvinced)
			I guess... but I'd feel a lot better 
			if... you had someone... you know... 
			someone special... like a 
			girlfriend...

            DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - 02/27/95 - ACT FOUR           45.

38   CONTINUED:	(5)

	Sisko reacts to this unexpected statement.

					SISKO
			I see...

					JAKE
			The thing is... you haven't had a 
			date in over a year.  A year, Dad...

	What can Sisko say?  It's true.  Sisko finds himself 
	responding as he would to a friend, a peer... he's forgotten 
	for the moment that this is his son.

					SISKO
			I guess I've been too busy...

					JAKE
			You've got to make time for these 
			things...

					SISKO
			You're right...

	Suddenly Sisko smiles to himself...

					SISKO
			I can't believe this... I'm getting 
			advice about women from my son...

					JAKE
			Don't think of me as your son right 
			now.  Just think of me as another 
			guy.
				(a beat)
			Another guy who happens to know a 
			very attractive lady who wants to 
			meet you.

	Sisko can't believe his ears.

					SISKO
			Are you trying to set me up?

					JAKE
			Why not?

	Before Sisko can reply the cabin lurches violently...

					JAKE
			What was that... ?

	Sisko rushes to the forward porthole to check the sails...

			I'm not sure... but whatever hit us 
			almost tore off the port mainsail...

	Suddenly the ship is hit by a second, more violent eddy --

39   EXT. SPACE - BAJORAN SHIP (OPTICAL)

	Through a mild distortion effect we see the ship being 
	buffeted by a light eddy so powerful it tears the port 
	mainsail off (the starboard spritsail has already been 
	jettisoned).  As the ship is caught up and whisked away we 
	cut back to --

41   EXT. SPACE - BAJORAN SHIP (OPTICAL)

	As it's swept along by some invisible current, the jib is 
	torn away.  The stars streak by in a warp effect, indicating 
	the ship is traveling at faster than light speeds.

42   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	Main power has failed, and the cabin is lit by dimmer 
	emergency lights.  Sisko is desperately trying to get control 
	of the violently lurching ship... He has to raise his voice 
	to be heard over the SOUND of groaning metal...

					SISKO
			Main power is off-line.  We're moving 
			at warp...

					JAKE
			How can that be... ?

					SISKO
			I don't know...

	Just as suddenly as they were caught up in it, the current 
	throws the ship free... the SOUND of groaning metal stops...

43   NEW ANGLE

	We can see through the window that the ship is no longer 
	traveling faster than light.

					JAKE
			What happened... ?

					SISKO
			Good question...

	Sisko moves to look at the star chart that's laid out on the 
	table...

					SISKO
			There's no record of any spatial 
			anomalies in this region...

	As Sisko considers the problem, Jake looks down at the 
	chart...

					JAKE
			What are these... ?

	Sisko answers almost distractedly, as if he doesn't think 
	his answer is relevant.

					SISKO
			Tachyon eddies... they run all through 
			this area...

					JAKE
			Could we have gotten caught up in 
			one... ?

					SISKO
			No... tachyons don't have enough 
			mass to affect a ship of this...

	He stops himself as he realizes something...

					JAKE
			What is it?

					SISKO
				(thinking out loud)
			But this isn't any ordinary ship, it 
			has a lot more surface area relative 
			to its mass...

					JAKE
			Because of the sails...

					SISKO
				(putting it together)
			And since tachyons travel faster 
			than light, it could be that their 
			impact on the sails somehow 
			accelerated us up to warp speeds...
				(beat)
			We could be light years off course...

					JAKE
			The question is, where did we end 
			up?

					SISKO
			You check the rigging, I'll try to 
			figure that out...

	Jake looks through a porthole at the sail and Sisko moves to 
	the sextant...

					JAKE
			We lost the jib and port mainsail...

	Sisko looks through the navigational sextant and is dismayed 
	to see that the main lens is shattered.

					SISKO
			Damn...

	Jake reacts to his father's dismay...

					JAKE
			What?

	Sisko shows him the shattered lens.

	They look at each other for a long moment, neither wanting 
	to admit defeat... finally...

			We'd better contact the station, let

			We were so close... another day and

					SISKO
			Hey, we did pretty well making it as

	Sisko works the unit... Jake sees that he seems concerned.

					JAKE
			Is something wrong?

					SISKO
			The station's not responding...

					JAKE
			Is the com unit damaged?

					SISKO
				(working the unit)
			Not as far as I can see...

			Actually, it ended up being more of

			Don't take this the wrong way... but

					BASHIR
			Really... ?

					ELIZABETH
			I read your paper on the immuno-

			Bajor.  It was brilliant.

					BASHIR

	as it limps along with its remaining sails...

47   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	where Sisko is working the com unit, sending out another 
	distress call.  Jake sees that he seems worried, and it  
	worries him, too.

					JAKE
			So, dad... we're not going to run 
			out of air or anything, are we?

					SISKO
			Don't worry.  Someone'll find us 
			before that happens.

	Sisko decides to make conversation to try and take Jake's 
	mind off their situation.

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/13/95 - ACT FIVE         54.

47   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Why don't you tell me about this 
			woman you want me to meet?

					JAKE
			Well, she's a freighter captain.

					SISKO
				(not sure if he likes 
				this)
			A freighter captain?

					JAKE
			Dad, trust me... you'll like her.

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/13/95 - ACT FIVE        54A.

47   CONTINUED:	(2)

	A quiet moment... then...

					SISKO
			All right, I'll meet her... on one 
			condition...

					JAKE
			What?

					SISKO
				(lightly)
			That you won't base your decision 
			about going to Pennington on how our 
			date turns out...

					JAKE
				(smiles)
			Don't worry... I won't.  I've already 
			decided to wait at least a year.

					SISKO
			How come?

					JAKE
			I've heard that you can only write 
			about what you've experienced... and 
			you've got to admit, Deep Space Nine 
			is a pretty good place to get 
			experience.

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/01/95 - ACT FIVE         55.

47   CONTINUED:	(3)

	Suddenly Jake reacts with concern to something he sees 
	out the window over Sisko's shoulder...

					JAKE
			Dad...

	Sisko sees the look on his face and turns toward the window...

48   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	as they look out the window and see THREE CARDASSIAN WARSHIPS 
	moving toward them...

					SISKO
				(grim)
			We've got company...

					JAKE
			What do you think they want... ?

49   RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)

	Suddenly the com unit beeps.

					SISKO
			Looks like we're about to find out...

	Sisko moves to it, activates the monitor... Dukat's face 
	appears on the screen...

					SISKO
			What can I do for you, Dukat?

	Dukat seems put upon, annoyed...

					DUKAT
			Let me be the first to congratulate 
			you, Commander...

					SISKO
			Congratulate me?

					DUKAT
			For managing to get all the way 
			here...

					SISKO
			All the way where?

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/02/95 - ACT FIVE        55A.

49   CONTINUED:

					DUKAT
			Don't you know?  You've just entered 
			the Cardassian system...

	Sisko and Jake exchange an astonished look.

					JAKE
			The tachyon eddy... it must've taken 
			us past the Denorias Belt and brought 
			us here...

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/13/95 - ACT FIVE         56.

49   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			The same thing must've happened to 
			the ancient Bajorans...

	They spontaneously move to grab hold of each other...

					JAKE
			We did it... we proved the trip was 
			possible...

	There's a moment as they both contemplate the wonder of what's 
	happened... then...

					DUKAT
			I hate to interrupt your celebration, 
			but I've been asked to convey a 
			message from the Cardassian 
			Government...

	He picks up a PADD, reads hastily, as if he can't wait to 
	get through it.

					DUKAT
			"Your voyage is a testament to the 
			spirit of the ancient Bajorans who 
			first ventured out into space... it 
			could not be more appropriate that 
			your arrival coincides with the 
			discovery here on Cardassia of an 
			ancient crash site... "

	Dukat clears his throat as if to distract attention from the 
	unlikely scenario he's been asked to portray...

					DUKAT
			"A site that our archaeologists believe 
			contains the remnants of one of the 
			Bajoran vessels whose journey you 
			have just recreated... "

					SISKO
				(wry)
			What an amazing coincidence...

					DUKAT
				(even)
			Yes...

	Dukat turns and gives a curt nod to someone off screen... 
	suddenly a BURST of colored LIGHT shines onto Jake and Sisko 
	through the window...

         DEEP SPACE: "Explorers" - REV. 03/01/95 - ACT FIVE         57.

49   CONTINUED:	(3)

					DUKAT
				(a forced smile)
			Welcome...

	They move to the window and smile at what they see...

50   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Cardassian ships are firing photon torpedoes that explode 
	into FIREWORKS like starbursts... welcoming the voyagers 
	with a festive display of light...

51   INT. BAJORAN SHIP

	Jake and Sisko standing at the window looking out at the 
	fireworks... the light from the explosions playing on their 
	beaming features... and as the music swells with a Reprise 
	of Jerusalem, we...

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FIVE                         
                            THE END
