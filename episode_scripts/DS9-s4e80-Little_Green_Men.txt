	FADE IN:

1    INT. QUARK'S

	We pan across the bar, which is covered with a 
	collection of Ferengi personal items and knickknacks -- 
	everything from ear-cleaners to pajamas to vials full 
	of the desiccated remains of notable Ferengi.

					ROM (O.S.) 
			When a young Ferengi goes out on 
			his own, he traditionally raises 
			capital by selling his boyhood 
			treasures.

2    NEW ANGLE

	To reveal NOG, standing behind the bar, his father ROM 
	at his side.

					ROM
				(continuing) 
			As you know, my son Nog will be 
			leaving shortly for Earth and 
			Starfleet Academy.

3    INCLUDE THE REST OF THE BAR

	To reveal the patrons of the bar and the crew of D.S. 
	Nine standing on the other side of the bar. SISKO, 
	O'BRIEN, KIRA, WORF, DAX, BASHIR and JAKE are all 
	present, along with Morn, several other regulars of 
	Quark's, and a dabo girl. Quark is notably absent. 
	Rom looks over at his son and his eyes mist over.

					ROM
				(choking up) 
			I'm going to miss him. And I know 
			you will too.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - TEASER       2.

3    CONTINUED:

					ROM (Cont'd) 
			And what better way to remember 
			him than to purchase one of his 
			very own personal belongings?
				(losing it) 
			I don't know about you, but, I'm 
			buying these pajamas.

	Rom picks up the pajamas and holds them up to his face 
	as he weeps.

					NOG
				(to his father) 
			That'll be three strips of 
			latinum.

					ROM 
			Two.

					NOG
			Sold.

	Rom, still holding Nog's pajamas to his face, pays his 
	son for his purchase.

					NOG
				(to the crowd) 
			Let the buying commence. No 
			reasonable offer will be refused.

	And as the Crowd begins to check the merchandise....

4    CLOSE ON O'BRIEN AND WORF

	Who hang back. Worf clearly isn't happy to be here.

					O'BRIEN 
			Mister Worf, I didn't expect to 
			see you here.

					WORF
			Captain Sisko made it a... 
			personal request that I attend. 
			He seems to have taken some
			interest in the young Ferengi.

					O'BRIEN
			The captain sponsored Nog's 
			application to the Academy.

					WORF
			A Ferengi at the Academy. I am 
			not sure that is wise.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" -09/19/95 - TEASER       2A.

4    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			I don't know. Not too long ago 
			someone might have said the same 
			thing about you.

	Just then, Sisko joins them.

					SISKO
			You two better hurry or there 
			won't be anything left to buy.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - TEASER       3.

4    CONTINUED:	(2)

	Which Kira and Worf both know is more than just a 
	suggestion. They exchange a look, and then head for 
	the table.

5    NEW ANGLE

	On Bashir and Dax, picking over the merchandise.

					BASHIR
				(holds up an isolinear 
				rod) 
			Nog, what's this?

					NOG 
			My favorite holosuite program... 
			"A Visit with the Pleasure Goddess 
			of Rixx." Yours for a mere ten 
			strips of latinum.

					DAX
			He'll take it.
				(to Bashir) 
			Consider it a gift.

					BASHIR
				(smiles) 
			You're too kind.

6    ANGLE ON KIRA

	As she picks up a springball racket off the bar.

					KIRA
			Nog? where did you get this 
			springball racket?

					NOG
				(thinking fast) 
			Out of a replicator?

					KIRA
			Try out of my quarters. This is 
			mine. I've been looking for it 
			for two years.

	Nog reacting like he's never seen it before.

					NOG
				(faux amazement) 
			And it was sitting here on the bar 
			all along. That's incredible.

	Nog makes a quick beeline to the other side of the bar.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - TEASER       4.

7    NEW ANGLE

	On Worf, who is examining a slim electrical tool with 
	a puzzled expression. Jake looks over at him.

					JAKE 
			It's a Ferengi tooth sharpener.

	Worf activates the sharpener and the head of the 
	instrument spins with a sharp whirr. Worf studies it 
	for a beat, then tentatively applies it to one of his 
	teeth. He holds it there for a beat as if trying to 
	decide if he likes it, then removes it and reaches 
	across the bar to grab a passing Nog.

					WORF
				(re: tooth sharpener) 
			How much?

8    ANGLE ON THE DOOR

	As QUARK ENTERS. He takes a look at the crowd gathered 
	around his nephew, then spots Rom, who is proudly 
	watching the sale. Quark grimaces in disgust and then 
	goes to get Rom.

					QUARK 
			Rom.

					ROM 
			Brother, you're here. If you 
			hurry, there still might be some 
			choice items left for you to buy.

					QUARK 
			I'm not here for the sale. Nog 
			has no business going to Starfleet 
			Academy. And I'm not doing 
			anything to encourage him.
				(a beat)
			Now come with me.

					ROM 
			But the sale...

					QUARK
			Is over as far as you're 
			concerned.
				(confidentially) 
			The ship... It's here.

					ROM 
			What ship?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - TEASER       5.

8    CONTINUED:

					QUARK 
			The ship. Our ship.
				(corrects himself)
			My ship. The shuttle cousin Gaila 
			owed me.

					ROM
				(surprised) 
			He's owed you that shuttle for ten 
			years.

					QUARK 
			Ever since I loaned him the  
			latinum to start up his munitions  
			consortium. He always said that  
			if he became a success, he'd buy  
			me my own ship. And now it's  
			here.

					ROM 
			But why do you need me?

 					QUARK  
			Because knowing our cousin, it's  
			probably defective merchandise.

					ROM
				(thinks it over for a beat)  
			I'd better have a look at it.

					QUARK  
			What a wonderful idea. Now get  
			going.

	Rom reluctantly starts to go, still holding the 
	pajamas. Quark snatches the pajamas out of Rom's hands 
	and flings them aside.

					QUARK  
			And leave those here.

	Quark and Rom EXIT.

	Establishing.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - TEASER       6.

10   INT. FERENGI SHUTTLE

	This is a similar ship to the Nagus's personal shuttle.
	It's small, with barely enough room for three or four 
	Ferengi. Rom pops his head out from inside a panel in 
	the back. Quark is sitting in the pilot's seat, 
	gleefully surveying his property.

					ROM 
			Brother?

	At the sound of his brother's voice, Quark seems to 
	deflate.

					QUARK 
			All right. Tel1 me what's wrong 
			with it.

					ROM 
			Nothing. The ship is perfect. 
			Gaila must've paid a fortune for 
			it.

 					QUARK 
			You mean, it'll actually fly?

					ROM 
			This ship could outrun a Romulan 
			interceptor. We could take it 
			halfway across the galaxy before 
			it would even need a maintenance 
			check.

					QUARK 
			You don't say.

	Quark looks around at the ship.

					QUARK 
			And it's all mine. I can go 
			anyplace I want.

					ROM 
			Maybe it's time you considered 
			that early retirement we talked 
			about. I could take over the bar, 
			and you could fly off into the 
			great unknown.
				(musing to himself) 
			Never to return.
				(quick correction) 
			Unless you wanted to.

					QUARK 
			Don't get your hopes up.
				(a beat)
			The first thing we need to do is
			take this thing for a test flight.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - TEASER       7.

10   CONTINUED:

					QUARK (Cont'd)
			Someplace reasonably far away, but 
			perfectly safe... Someplace 
			like...

	Rom can't believe what he's hearing. Is Quark really 
	offering what he thinks he's offering.

					ROM 
			Earth?

					QUARK 
			Exactly. If the boy's going to go 
			to Starfleet Academy, he might as 
			well do it in style.

					ROM 
			Yes, Brother. Thank you, Brother. 
			I'll go tell Nog. 
				(a beat) 
			A trip to Earth. This is going to 
			be fun.

	Rom EXITS.

					QUARK
			Not to mention profitable. 
				(pats the console) 
			"All I ask is a tall ship... and 
			a load of contraband to fill her 
			with."

	And as Quark smiles to himself, already thinking of 
	ways to make money with the shuttle, we...

									FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

11   INT. QUARK'S

	Morn is behind the bar, and Quark is giving him a few 
	last minute instructions.

					QUARK
			Here're the codes to operate the 
			holosuites.
				(hands him an isolinear
				rod)
			Now remember, don't extend any
			lines of credit, don't touch the
			dabo girls, and make sure you keep
			your eyes on him...

	Morn follows Quark's glance and sees...

12   NEW ANGLE

	ODO, standing by the door, surveying the crowd.

					QUARK
				(continuous) 
			Because he'll be keeping his eyes 
			on you.

	Odo approaches Quark. Morn watches Odo intently, then 
	nods and EXITS.

					ODO
				(sarcastic) 
			Good choice, Quark. I'm sure 
			Morn'll do an excellent job, as 
			long as he doesn't drink up all 
			your profits.

					QUARK
				(grumbling) 
			Better him than one of the Ferengi 
			waiters. They'd rob me blind.

					ODO
				(a beat) 
			Very generous of you... taking Nog 
			to Earth.

					QUARK 
			I'm a generous person.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 10/09/95 - ACT ONE    9.

12   CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			So I've noticed.

					QUARK 
			Try not to miss me too much while 
			I'm gone.

					ODO
				(sarcastic) 
			I'll be counting the days until 
			you get back.

	Quark EXITS. Odo watches him go.

13   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	Jake and Nog are standing at their old spot near the 
	crossover bridge, looking down at the passing crowd.

					JAKE 
			I wonder how many hours you and I 
			spent hanging around up here.

					NOG 
			Two thousand, one-hundred and 
			forty-seven.

	Jake looks at Nog in surprise.

					NOG 
			Just kidding. But it was a lot.

					JAKE 
			You know, outside of playing 
			Dom-jot and watching the Bajoran 
			transports dock, it seems like we 
			spent most of our time... doing 
			nothing.

					NOG 
			Maybe so. But I can't think of 
			anyone I'd rather do nothing with 
			than you.

					JAKE 
			Same here.

					BASHIR (O.S.)
				(calling from off screen) 
			Nog.

	Jake and Nog turn to see O'Brien and Bashir 
	approaching. Bashir is holding a package in his hand.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/20/95 - ACT ONE   10.

13   CONTINUED:

					NOG
				(a warning) 
			Doctor, if you're trying to return 
			something from the sale...

					O'BRIEN
				(defending) 
			It's a going-away present.

					BASHIR 
			To help you get around easier on 
			Earth.

	Bashir hands him the package. Nog opens it and takes 
	out a PADD. He checks the PADD.

					NOG 
			A guidebook?

					O'BRIEN
				(a little defensive) 
			It's not just a guidebook. It's 
			a completely interactive program 
			detailing Earth's customs, 
			culture, history and geography.

					BASHIR 
			Everything you ever wanted to know 
			about Earth is right in that PADD.

					NOG 
			You mean it'll teach me how to 
			attract human females?

					O'BRIEN
			Almost everything.

					NOG
				(sincere) 
			I'm sure it'll come in handy. 
			Thank you.
				(a beat) 
			Well, I'd better get going. My 
			father and Uncle Quark are waiting 
			for me.

					O'BRIEN
			Good luck, Nog.

					BASHIR 
			Make us proud.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/20/95 - ACT ONE   11.

13   CONTINUED:	(2)


	Bashir and O'Brien EXIT.

14   CLOSE ON JAKE AND NOG

	As they realize this is good-bye.

					JAKE 
			I'll walk you over to the airlock.

	Nog and Jake walk a couple of steps, then both turn 
	back and take one last look at their old hangout.

					JAKE 
			It was a good spot.

					NOG 
			The best.

	Jake and Nog EXIT.

15   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

16   INT. OPS 

	Kira and Dax are at their stations. Sisko comes out of 
	his office.

					DAX
			The Ferengi Shuttle "Quark's 
			Treasure" has departed the 
			station.

					KIRA
			Quark, Rom and Nog together on 
			that ship all the way to Earth.
				(a beat)
			I'm glad I'm not going with them.

					SISKO
			Only one thing worries me.
				(off reactions, joking) 
			No one warned Earth that they're 
			coming.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men"- REV. 10/09/95 - ACT ONE    12.

16   CONTINUED:

	Dax doesn't get the irony. Kira smiles.

17   INT. FERENGI SHUTTLE

	Rom is in the pilot's chair. Quark sits behind him, 
	playing Captain. Nog is off to one side, reading from 
	his guidebook to Earth.

					NOG
				(amazed) 
			It says here that humans didn't 
			even have currency until five 
			thousand years ago. Let alone 
			banking, speculative investments 
			or a unified global economy.

					QUARK 
			They're a primitive, backward 
			people, Nog. Pity them.

					NOG 
			But think about it, uncle. That 
			means they went from being savages 
			with a simple barter system to the 
			leaders of a vast interstellar 
			Federation in only five thousand 
			years... It took us twice as long 
			to establish the Ferengi Alliance. 
			And we had to buy warp technology 
			from the...

					QUARK
				(cuts him off) 
			Five thousand... ten thousand... 
			what's the difference? The speed 
			of technological advancement isn't 
			nearly as important as short-term 
			quarterly gains.
				(snaps at Rom) 
			Can't this thing go any faster?

					ROM 
			We're already exceeding the safe 
			maximum cruising speed by two 
			tenths of a warp factor.

					QUARK
				(playing Captain) 
			Push it another tenth. This trip 
			is taking long enough as it is.

	Rom nods. He understands.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - ACT ONE      13.

17   CONTINUED:

					ROM 
			Relax, Brother. I know kemacite 
			is unstable, but another day or 
			two won't make any difference.

					QUARK
			What are you talking about?

					ROM 
			The shipment of kemacite that 
			you're smuggling in the cargo 
			hold.

					NOG
				(surprised) 
			Uncle Quark, you're smuggling 
			kemacite? Isn't that dangerous?

					ROM
				(answering for his 
				brother) 
			Dangerous... And highly 
			profitable. Especially if we make 
			a side trip to Orion on the way 
			home from Earth.

	Quark considers continuing to deny Rom's accusations, 
	but decides it isn't worth the effort.

					QUARK
			What tipped you off?

					ROM 
			When I engaged the impulse 
			engines, I noticed the ship's 
			weight distribution was a little 
			off. So the last time you went to 
			waste extraction... I snuck back 
			to the cargo bay and took a look 
			around.

	Quark can't believe he's been caught by Rom of all 
	people.

					QUARK
			When did you get so smart?

					ROM 
			I've always been smart, Brother. 
			I've just lacked self-confidence.
				(a beat) 
			Of course, I could forget 
			everything I saw.

					QUARK 
			How much?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - ACT ONE      14.

17   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ROM 
			Twenty percent of the profits.

	Quark turns on Nog.

					QUARK
			And I suppose you'll want a cut, 
			too?

					NOG 
			As a Starfleet cadet, it's my duty 
			to report any violation of 
			Federation law to my superiors 
			immediately.
				(smiles) 
			But then again, I haven't been 
			sworn in yet. I'll take ten 
			percent.

					QUARK
				(grumbling) 
			It's a deal.
				(to Rom) 
			I thought I told you to go faster.

	Rom nods, pleased with the outcome of the conversation.

					ROM 
			Faster it is.

	He inputs the command to increase speed.

			Take her out of warp.

	As Rom inputs the commands, Nog comes out from the back 
	compartment. He's holding his PADD.

					QUARK

			All humans look alike.

	Quark sits up and looks at the instrument panel.

					QUARK
			I thought I told you to take us 
			out of warp.

	Rom continues to input commands. He's starting to look 
	worried.

					ROM 
			I'm trying, Brother. But the warp 
			core isn't responding. It looks 
			like the command sequencer has 
			been disabled.

	Rom starts frantically working the controls.

					ROM 
			I don't understand. I tested 
			everything. The only way this 
			could've happened is...
				(getting a bad feeling) 
			If the command sequencer was 
			designed to fail.

					NOG 
			You mean... sabotage.

	As soon as the word is out of Nog's mouth, Quark sees 
	exactly what's occurred.

					QUARK
				(bitter) 
			Cousin Gaila.

					NOG 
			He never did like you very much, 
			Uncle.

					QUARK 
			Okay, okay. No need to panic. So 
			the warp drive won't shut down. 
			What's the worst thing that could 
			happen?

					ROM 
			The ship could continue 
			accelerating until it tears itself 
			apart and scatters our remains 
			halfway across the quadrant.

	Quark agitatedly tries to think of a way out.

					QUARK
			There must be something we can 
			do...

					ROM
				(thinking aloud) 
			Jettison the warp core... No, I 
			tried that already. Emergency 
			overrides are frozen.

					QUARK 
			Then we'll have to try something 
			else, won't we?

					ROM
				(gets an idea) 
			The kemacite!
				(off reactions, trying 
				to sell them)
			If we vent plasma from the warp 
			core into the cargo hold, we may 
			be able to start a cascade 
			reaction in the kemacite. 

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/20/95 - ACT ONE   17.

19   CONTINUED:	(3)

					ROM (Cont'd) 
			Then we can modulate the reaction 
			to create an inversion wave in the 
			warp field and force the ship back 
			into normal space! If I time it 
			just right, I should be able to 
			get us close enough to Earth to 
			make an emergency landing.

	Quark and Nog look at each other, hoping one of them 
	will back up Rom's theory. Unfortunately, neither of 
	them has any idea of what he's saying.

					QUARK
			Rom, you're a genius.

					ROM 
			You think so?

					QUARK 
			How should I know? I have no idea 
			what you're talking about. Just 
			do it.

	Rom sets about implementing his plan.

					ROM 
			Hold on.

	And with that, Rom hits a control and the ship SHAKES 
	violently, a high pitched whine starts to build and...

	The Ferengi Shuttle, still at warp, is suddenly 
	surrounded by a ball of incandescent white light, white

23   NEW ANGLE

	As Quark sits up in shock and looks around. He's 
	sitting on a World War Two-era operating room table, a 
	white sheet draped over his body. He's still dressed 
	in his clothes, but all pins, metal buttons, and other 
	ornaments have been removed. He looks around and sees 
	Nog and Rom, lying on similar beds. They're 
	unconscious.

			Rom? Nog?

	There's a mirror across the room which reflects Quark's 
	face. But before Ouark (or the audience) can 
	completely process this location, we...

	a drag, and lifts a 1940's era phone to face.

27   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	This is a dark, smoke-filled room, where soldiers in 
	1940's-era clothing study the Ferengi through what we 
	now realize is a two-way mirror.

	In the center of the room is a broad-beamed, craggy-
	faced Army Air Corps general, the butt of a fat stogie 
	clenched in his teeth. This is GENERAL REX DENNING, a 
	no-nonsense veteran of two world wars who's ready to 
	take on the Martians to defend the good old USA if 
	necessary.

	Also present are Captain Wainwright, PROFESSOR JEFF 
	CARLSON, an idealistic young scientist, his fiancee 
	FAITH GARLAND, a Woman's Army Corps nurse, and two 
	M.P.s, one with a large GERMAN SHEPHERD guard dog.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			We've got the farmer who found 
			their ship locked up in the 
			B.O.Q., but I don't know how much 
			longer we can keep him there.

	When Denning speaks it's with the gravely voice of a 
	lifelong smoker.


					GENERAL DENNING 
			You keep him there until I tell 
			you to let him go. Did you take 
			care of that idiot in Roswell who 
			told the press we captured a 
			flying saucer?

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			We've convinced him to issue a

	lights both cigarettes.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			You can't keep this from the 
			public forever, General. Beings 
			from another planet have landed on 
			Earth. It's one of the most 
			important events in human history.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			Maybe. But we can't risk causing 
			a panic. I'm not telling the 
			public anything until we know 
			exactly what we're up against.

	Denning turns and we see that everyone in the room is 
	watching Quark, Nog and Rom through the two-way 
	mirror. We can't hear them until the General reaches 
	over and flips a toggle switch activating a speaker 
	over the mirror. (Because the Ferengis' universal 
	translators are on the blink, we hear untranslated 
	Ferengi whenever we're seeing them from the humans'

	Quark, Rom and Nog are trying to make sense of their 
	surroundings. Now that the Ferengi are alone, we 
	understand them perfectly. Quark checks the room's 
	only door.

					QUARK 
			Locked.

			What is this place? Where are we?

			General, these creatures come from 
			a race far more advanced than our 
			own. There's no telling what they

	General Denning takes a long, thoughtful puff on his

					GENERAL DENNING 
			Well you're in luck. The

			So that's just what you're going

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			Me?

					GENERAL DENNING 
			We didn't ask you here just

			But you had to go to Starfleet

			Maybe we are dead.

					QUARK

			How do they get their hands on it?

			They buy it in stores.

					QUARK
			They buy it?

			If they'll buy poison, they'll buy

	Quark's eyes light up.

					QUARK
				(a predatory smile) 
			I think I'm going to like it here.

	Nog can tell what Quark is thinking.

47   EXT. ARMY/AIR CORPS BASE - OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - DAY 

	General Denning is having a smoke and talking to 
	Professor Carlson and Captain Wainwright. Wainwright 
	shows Denning a black and white photo of the shuttle.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			The aliens' ship has a small 
			control area in the front and 
			rudimentary sleeping quarters in 
			the back. So far, we can't even 
			figure out what drives the 
			engines, let alone how they work.

	As Wainwright is talking, the stray German Shepherd 
	wanders up to the three men. Jeff bends down to 
	scratch the dog behind the ear.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			Hey, how you doing, big fella.

					GENERAL DENNING
			You making any headway, Professor?

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			It's fascinating. I would've 
			expected creatures of their 
			technological sophistication to 
			communicate telepathically. But 
			they seem to have a structured 
			verbal language just like we do.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/21/95 - ACT THREE  35.

47   CONTINUED:

					PROFESSOR CARLSON (Cont'd) 
				(thinks for a beat) 
			Given enough time, a good team of 
			linguists could probably decipher it.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			We're not bringing in anyone else. 
			Too many people know about this as
			it is.

					GENERAL DENNING 
				(agreeing) 
			Besides, we don't have the time. 
			President Truman is an impatient man. 
			He wants answers, and he 
			wants 'em now.

48   NEW ANGLE

	As Nurse Garland comes out of the building. She looks 
	excited.

					NURSE GARLAND 
			Jeff, General Denning... I think 
			you'd better come inside right 
			away.

	General Denning and Professor Carlson exchange a look, 
	then head for the building.

49   INT. EXAMINING ROOM 

	Quark stands proudly in front of the other two Ferengi, 
	waiting expectantly. As Professor Carlson rushes into 
	the room, followed by Denning and Wainwright, Quark 
	brings himself up to his full height, puffs out his 
	chest impressively, and speaks perfectly understandable 
	English in his most commanding voice.

					QUARK
			My name is Quark... Chief 
			Financial Officer of the Ferengi 
			Alliance. And I've got a business 
			proposition for you.

	And as Denning, Wainwright, Nurse Garland, and 
	Professor Carlson react to Quark's pronouncement...

50   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Quark has asked for a private audience with Denning. 
	What he's gotten is Denning and two M.P. bodyguards. 
	Denning is standing over Quark, looking into his ear 
	with a flashlight.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			I don't see any universal 
			translator.

					QUARK 
			Trust me, it's in there.

	Denning flicks off the flashlight and takes a 
	contemplative puff on his cigar.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			And this gadget of yours, that's 
			what makes it possible for us to 
			understand each other? 
				(off Quark's nod) 
			How's it work?

					QUARK 
			It's simple... if you have the 
			know-how. You'd be surprised at 
			the kind of things you can do... 
			with the right technology. Which 
			brings me to why I'm here.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			I was wondering about that.

					QUARK
			I've been sent by my people to 
			open up a new market for advanced 
			Ferengi technology.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			What kind of technology are you 
			talking about?

					QUARK 
			How would you like to travel 
			beyond the stars at speeds you 
			never even dreamt were possible? 
			Or be able to transport yourself 
			from one place to another in the 
			blink of an eye?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men"- REV. 10/09/95 - ACT FOUR  36A.

50   CONTINUED:

					GENERAL DENNING 
			You know how to do that?

					QUARK 
			That's only the beginning. We can 
			give you the medical knowledge to 
			cure your deadliest diseases. We 
			have machines that can produce 
			food, clothing, out of thin air.

	General Denning chomps on his stogie and moves closer 
	to Quark.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			What about weapons?

	Quark breaks into a broad grin.

					QUARK 
			Weapons... If you want weapons, 
			I'm the man to see. We can teach 
			you how to make phasers, 
			disruptors, photon torpedoes... or 
			even quantum torpedoes. A little 
			more expensive, but worth it.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			And what do you want in return?

					QUARK 
			That depends. What do you use for 
			currency around here... latinum... 
			dilithium...

					GENERAL DENNING 
			We use dollars.

					QUARK
				(considers it) 
			Dollars... never heard of them.
				(hopeful) 
			Don't you have any gemstones, or 
			precious minerals?

					GENERAL DENNING 
			You mean like gold?

					QUARK 
			Gold? Gold is good.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 10/09/95 - ACT FOUR  36B.

50   CONTINUED:	(2)

					GENERAL DENNING 
			How much gold are we talking 
			about?

					QUARK 
			Seeing that we're going to be 
			advancing your culture about four 
			hundred years overnight... I'd say 
			a couple of million bars would be 
			about right.
				(a beat) 
			As a good faith deposit.

	The two M.P.s turn their heads to one another. They 
	don't like the sound of that. Neither does Denning.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - ACT FOUR     37.

50   CONTINUED:	(3)

					GENERAL DENNING 
			You know, Quark, you might be some 
			kind of Martian...

					QUARK
				(interrupting) 
			Ferengi.


					GENERAL DENNING 
			Whatever. But the more we talk, 
			the more you remind me of my 
			brother-in-law.

					QUARK 
			Is he a businessman?

					GENERAL DENNING 
			He's a car salesman. And not a 
			very good one.

					QUARK 
			Then he's nothing like me.

					GENERAL DENNING
				(smoldering) 
			The bottom line is I don't trust 
			him and I don't trust you. So 
			before we sit down and sign any 
			contracts, you're going to tell me 
			what the hell you people are 
			really doing here.

	By the end of the above speech, Denning is in Quark's 
	face. Quark backs away, but tries to stay calm.

					QUARK
				(rational) 
			I just told you. We're here to 
			open up trade negotiations. If 
			you're not interested, just say 
			so. I'm sure I can do business 
			with one of your planet's other 
			nation states.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			In other words, if we don't play 
			ball, you'll sell those advanced 
			weapons of yours to the Russians.

	Quark has no idea who the Russians are, but he can tell 
	Denning doesn't like him.


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men"- REV. 10/09/95 - ACT FOUR   38.

50   CONTINUED:	(4)

					QUARK 
			I'd rather it didn't come to that. 
			To be honest, I'd much rather work 
			with you Australians.

					GENERAL DENNING 
			Americans.

					QUARK 
			Whatever. But if you won't do 
			business with me, and the Russians 
			will, who am I to say no?

	Denning doesn't trust Quark, but he doesn't want him 
	talking to the Russians either.

					GENERAL DENNING
				(tough) 
			I'm not saying we can't do 
			business. But I don't have the 
			authority to make this kind of 
			decision. I'll have to get 
			clearance from the President.

					QUARK
			I can wait.

	General Denning exhales a puff of smoke. Quark coughs.

					QUARK 
			But in the meantime, let me give 
			you some free advice, just to show 
			I'm on your side.
				(confidential) 
			You people should take better care 
			of yourselves. Stop poisoning 
			your bodies with tobacco and atom 
			bombs. Sooner or later, that kind 
			of stuff will kill you.

	General Denning's eyes narrow. Quark's attacking basic 
	American values.

					GENERAL DENNING
			What do you know about atom bombs?

	Quark puts on his best superior space being attitude.

					QUARK 
			My people have been watching your 
			world for many years. We know all 
			about you. Baseball, root beer, 
			darts... atom bombs.

50   CONTINUED:	(5)

					QUARK (Cont'd) 
			It's quite a fascinating culture 
			you humans have here. And with a 
			little Ferengi technology, it 
			could be even better.
				(a beat) 
			Now, why don't you go talk to that

	Hold on Denning as he considers Quark's offer.

52   INT. EXAMINING ROOM

	Faith and Jeff are talking with Rom and Nog. Now that 
	the universal translators are working, they're getting 
	along very well. The German Shepherd is curled up at 
	Professor Carlson's feet. The Professor scratches it.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			Let me get this straight, Rom... 
			Are you saying that all the women 
			on your world walk around naked?

					ROM 
			It's the law.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			You don't say?

					NURSE GARLAND
				(amused) 
			Well I guess I'm never going to 
			visit your world.
				(to the Professor) 
			And neither are you.

	Nog rubbing his ear, pretending it hurts.

					NURSE GARLAND 
			Are you sure you don't want a

					NOG 
			No. I feel more comfortable with

					NOG 
			Ah... much better.

					ROM 
			You know, come to think of it, my

	Just then:

53   NEW ANGLE

	As Quark ENTERS, looking proud of himself. Everyone 
	looks over at him. Faith stops oo-moxing Nog, to his 
	disappointment.

					ROM 
			Brother, how did your meeting with 
			the general go?

	Quark doesn't answer. He looks over at Jeff and Faith. 
	He obviously wants some privacy. Professor Carlson 
	takes the hint.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			It's late. We should let you get 
			some rest.

					NOG 
			I'm not tired.

					NURSE GARLAND
			We'll visit some more tomorrow.

	Faith and Jeff EXIT, but the dog stays in the room.

54   ANGLE ON THE DOG (OPTICAL)

	As the German Shepherd gets up and approaches Quark. 
	The Ferengis back away in fear from this monstrous

					QUARK
			They forgot to take that thing

					ROM
			It seems to like you, brother.

					QUARK
				(to the dog)
			Get away from me.

	Just then, the dog leaps up, plants its paws on Quark's 
	shoulders, and MORPHS into...

55   ODO

	Who grabs Quark by the lapels and glares at him.

					ODO
			Hello, Quark.

					QUARK
			Odo? What are you doing here?

					ODO
			Placing you under arrest for
			attempting to smuggle kemacite.

	Rom realizes what this means.

					ROM
			You hid on board the ship.

					ODO 
				(grumpy) 
			That's right. And now I'm stuck 
			here with you.
				(a beat) 
			Now listen carefully, because I 
			don't have much time. Someone 
			could walk in here any minute.
			Your ship is in a hangar on the
			other side of the base. It 
			sustained some damage in the 
			crash, but the engines are still 
			functioning. If we're lucky, we 
			should be able to use it to get 
			away from here.

					NOG 
			And go where? Even if we get 
			away, we'll still be trapped four 
			hundred years in the past.

					ROM 
			Actually, I've been thinking. If 
			there's enough kemacite left, 
			there might be a way to get back
			to our own time.

					ODO
			How?

					ROM 
			If we find a sufficiently powerful 
			energy source, we should be able 
			to trigger a temporal surge in the 
			subspace continuum and recreate 
			the same kind of time warp that 
			brought us here in the first place.

					ODO
			What do you mean by a sufficiently 
			powerful energy source?

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 10/09/95 - ACT FOUR   43.

55   CONTINUED:	(2)

	But before Rom can answer, Quark jumps in.

					QUARK
			We're not going anywhere.
				(off reactions)
			We're staying right here.

					ROM 
			But Brother, what about the bar?

					QUARK 
			Who cares about the bar? I'm 
			telling you, Rom... we stay here 
			and inside a year, we'll be 
			running this place.

					ROM 
			You mean the military base?

					QUARK
			I mean the whole planet.

	Odo harumphs.

					QUARK
			Harumph all you want. But these 
			humans, they're not like the ones 
			from the Federation. They're 
			crude, gullible and greedy.

					ODO
			You mean, like you.

					QUARK 
			These are humans I can 
			understand... and manipulate.

					NOG 
			But Uncle, what about the 
			timeline?

					QUARK 
			Forget this timeline. The one
			we're going to create will be 
			better. Once we've got things in 
			order here, we'll contact the 
			Ferengi homeworld, and sell them 
			our ship. The Ferengi will have 
			warp drive technology centuries 
			before humans or Klingons or even 
			the Vulcans. We'll establish an 
			economic empire beyond even Grand 
			Nagus Zek's wildest dreams. And 
			I'll control it all.

55   CONTINUED:	(3)

	There's a beat, and then...

				(to Rom)
			I'll have the ship ready to go in

				(to Quark) 
			And you're all going to be on it.

					QUARK

			We'll see about that.

	And with that...

56   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Odo MORPHS back into the dog.

57   EXT. ARMY/AIR CORPS BASE - NIGHT

	A nervous Captain Wainwright is pacing outside the 
	examination building, smoking a cigarette. A jeep 
	pulls up, with General Denning and his driver. When 
	Wainwright sees him, he stop pacing and puts out his 
	cigarette.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			What's the word, General?

					GENERAL DENNING 
			That little piano-playing 
			Democrat's not as dumb as he 
			looks. He's not about to make a 
			deal with these aliens until we 
			learn more about them.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			And how does the president propose 
			we do that?

					GENERAL DENNING 
			He said he'd leave that in our

58   INT. EXAMINING ROOM

	Quark paces back and forth, trying to convince Rom and 
	Nog his plan is sound.

					QUARK
			I'm telling you, this is the 
			opportunity of a lifetime.

					ROM 
			I don't know, Brother. It seems 
			awfully risky to me.

					QUARK 
			"The riskier the road, the greater 
			the profit."

					ROM 
			What about Rule of Acquisition two 
			hundred and three? "New customers 
			are like razor-toothed gree-worms. 
			They can be succulent, but 
			sometimes they bite back."

					QUARK
			If there's any biting to be done, 
			we're the one's who're going to do
			it.

	Suddenly, almost as if to prove Quark wrong, the door 
	bursts in, and four M.P.s charge inside. Before Quark 
	or the others can react, the M.P.s throw burlap sacks 
	over their heads and point guns at them.

59   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

	The bag is pulled off Quark's head. He finds himself 
	strapped to a chair in a dark room, with a single 
	glaring light shining in his eyes. Rom and Nog are 
	also tied down, with the bags still over their heads.

					QUARK
			This is an outrage. I demand to

	want to be here.

					NURSE GARLAND

	To include Rom and Nog strapped to their chairs, the

	Rom tries to melt back into the chair.

					ROM
				(spilling his guts) 
			It was an accident... we're from

			Landing zone? Where? Tell me.

					NOG 
			Why not? Your feeble weapons will 
			be useless against us. We will 
			kill all the males, and take your 
			females to mate with.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT
				(urgent) 
			Where's the landing zone?

					NOG 
			Untie me and I'll show you on that 
			map.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT
				(to one of the M.P.s) 
			You heard him.
				(to the other M.P.) 
			Go get General Denning. Tell him 
			he was right about the Martians 
			all along.
				(to Nog) 
			Now show me.

	As the First M.P. goes to untie Nog, the Second M.P. 
	nods and EXITS. Wainwright takes out his .45 and 
	covers Nog.

63   CLOSE ON NOG

	As the M.P. releases him and he walks over to the map.

					NOG 
			The first landing parties will arrive here.

	He points to the map, but he's a few feet away and with 
	the scale of the map, he could be pointing to anything 
	between Pittsburgh and Denver.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			Where?

					NOG 
			Here. Right by that blue blob.

	Wainwright moves closer to get a better look.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/26/95 - ACT FIVE   51.

63   CONTINUED:

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			You mean your people are going to 
			invade... Cleveland?

	Nog moves closer to the map so that he's standing 
	slightly in front of Wainwright.

					NOG 
			No, not Cleveland. Here.

	And with that, Nog suddenly drives his elbow back into 
	Wainwright's gut, pivots and decks him. Wainwright 
	drops his pistol to the ground. Nog dives for the gun, 
	but just before he reaches it, the remaining M.P. 
	chambers his .45 and aims it right at Nog.

					NURSE GARLAND 
			Don't hurt him.

	Nog looks from the gun, to the M.P., to Wainwright.

					NOG 
			It was an accident. I tripped... 
			I didn't mean to do it.

	Nurse Garland look imploringly at Jeff.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
				(gasping for breath) 
			Shoot him.

	But before the M.P. can pull the trigger...

64   NEW ANGLE 

	Carlson impulsively slugs the M.P. and Nurse Garland 
	slams Captain Wainwright over the head with a metal 
	hospital tray. Both the M.P. and Wainwright slump into 
	unconsciousness.

					NOG 
			Thank you.

					QUARK 
			We're all very grateful, but 
			couldn't you have done that an 
			hour ago?

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			We've got to get you out of here.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 10/09/95 - ACT FIVE   52.

64   CONTINUED:

	Professor Carlson and Nurse Garland help untie Quark 
	and Rom.

					ROM 
			Won't you get in trouble for this?

					QUARK 
			Why should they? We forced them 
			to help us... by using our...

	Quark searches for a plausible explanation.

					NURSE GARLAND 
			Your insidious mind control 
			powers.

					QUARK 
			That's not bad.

					NOG
				(to Carlson) 
			For a primitive female, she's
			pretty smart.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			Come on... Your ship's in Hangar 
			Eighteen.

	They all EXIT.

65   EXT. ARMY/AIR CORPS BASE - NIGHT

	Garland runs out.

					NURSE GARLAND
				(to the M.P.s) 
			Captain Wainwright wants to see 
			you in exam room three.

	The M.P.s go inside, and the Ferengis and their 
	rescuers head for a jeep.

					GENERAL DENNING (O.S.) 
			Hold it right there.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - 09/19/95 - ACT FIVE     53.

66   NEW ANGLE 

	To reveal General Denning, flanked by two more M.P.s 
	with guns drawn.

	Thinking fast, Quark sticks his finger up against Nurse 
	Garland's head.

					QUARK
			Stay back, or I'll... disintegrate
			this hostage.

					GENERAL DENNING
			With your finger?

					QUARK
			With my death ray.

					GENERAL DENNING
			Looks a lot like a finger to me.

	Suddenly...

67   A NEARBY JEEP (OPTICAL)

	MORPHS into Odo, who knocks out Denning and the two 
	M.Ps.

					ODO
				(to Quark)
			Can we please leave now?

					PROFESSOR CARLSON
				(to Quark)
			Who's he?

					QUARK
				(re: Odo)
			My hero.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/25/95 - ACT FIVE   54.

EXT. HANGAR - NIGHT

	The jeep, carrying Odo, Quark, Nog, Rom, Nurse Garland
	and Professor Carlson pulls up to a Hangar which has a 
	large number "18" painted on it.

					NOG 
			You're sure they're going to be 
			detonating an atomic bomb today?

					NURSE GARLAND 
			That's what it said in the paper. 
			Five A.M. at the Proving Grounds 
			in Nevada. But I don't see how an 
			Atomic Bomb is going to help you 
			get home.

					ROM 
			We need to harness the beta 
			radiation to trigger a cascade...

					QUARK
				(cuts him off) 
			Save your breath.  It's much too 
			complicated for them to grasp.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON 
			Five A.M. -- that's seven minutes 
			from now.

					ROM 
			Don't worry. We'll get there.

					QUARK
				(to Nurse Garland and 
				Professor Carlson) 
			Thanks for your help. You may be 
			Humans, but you're okay with me.

					NURSE GARLAND 
			You don't have to thank us. I 
			only hope that one day, mankind 
			will travel to the stars, and take 
			its place in a vast alliance of 
			planets.

					ROM
				(correcting her) 
			Federation of Planets.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/25/95 - ACT FIVE   55.

68   CONTINUED:

					NURSE GARLAND 
			Excuse me?

					QUARK
				(glaring at Rom) 
			Don't pay any attention to him.
			He's an idiot. Trust me. The 
			galaxy is a pretty rough place. 
			You people are much better off 
			staying here on Earth.

					ODO
				(stern)
			Let's go, Quark.

	Everyone EXITS, leaving Nurse Garland and Professor 
	Carlson alone. Carlson goes to the jeep and opens the 
	door for Faith.

					PROFESSOR CARLSON
				(musing) 
			A vast alliance of planets.
				(smiles) 
			You get the craziest ideas.

	They get in the jeep and drive away.

	Just then, there's a loud rumble, and...


69   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	The Ferengi shuttle crashes out of the roof of Hangar 
	Eighteen and zips off into the night sky.

70   EXT. ARMY/AIR CORPS BASE - NIGHT

	Wainwright is helping Denning to his feet as the 
	Ferengi shuttle rockets by over their heads.

					CAPTAIN WAINWRIGHT 
			What do we do now, General?

	Denning thinks about it for a second. He takes the 
	cigar out of his mouth and rolls it around in his 
	fingers.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV- 09/25/95 - ACT FIVE   56.

70   CONTINUED:

					GENERAL DENNING 
			About what, Captain?
				(off reaction) 
			All we ever found was a crashed 
			weather balloon.

	Denning jams the cigar back into his mouth and chomps 
	on it even harder.

71   INT. FERENGI SHUTTLE

	Quark and Rom are in the pilot's seats. Odo and Nog 
	are standing behind them.

					ODO
			Now tell me again what happens 
			when we get there?

					ROM 
			We fly straight into the atomic 
			explosion, expose the kemacite to 
			the beta radiation and engage the 
			warp engines. If we have enough 
			kemacite, we should be able to 
			create a reverse time warp and 
			ride it home.

					NOG
			My dad. Always thinking.

	Odo and Quark exchange a look. Neither of them look 
	particularly confident in Rom's plan.

					ODO
				(to Quark)
			If this doesn't work, I'm holding 
			you personally responsible.

					QUARK
			I don't remember inviting you on 
			this trip.

	A com-panel beeps.

					ROM
				(off readouts) 
			There it is. Hold on.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/25/95 - ACT FIVE   57.

71   CONTINUED:

	And as Rom banks the ship...

									CUT TO:

72   EXT. NEVADA DESERT (OPTICAL) - NIGHT

	Close on the mushrooming cloud of a nuclear explosion. 
	Hold on it for a second, and then the Ferengi shuttle 
	zooms into screen and plunges into the cloud.

73   INT. FERENGI SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)

	The Ferengi shuttle is undergoing some serious shaking 
	and stirring.

					QUARK
			I don't like this.

					ODO
				(concerned)
			Rom, tell your brother it's
			going to be all right.

					ROM
			It's going to be all right,
			Brother.
				(qualifying)
			I hope.

	Suddenly, the screen WHITES OUT.

74   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Earth as seen from space. Suddenly the Ferengi 
	shuttle winks into existence and drifts across the 
	screen, with no engine power.

75   INT. FERENGI SHUTTLE

	Odo, Quark, Rom and Nog regain consciousness.

					NOG
			Did we make it?

					ROM
				(trying to reassure himself)
			This doesn't look like the Divine
			Treasury.

					QUARK
			What year is it?

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/25/95 - ACT FIVE   58.

75   CONTINUED:

					ROM 
			Good question.

					ODO
			What's that flashing indicator?

	Rom takes a beat to figure out what it is.

					ROM
				(excited)
			We're being hailed.

					QUARK
				(to Rom) 
			Answer them, answer them.

	Rom activates the speaker for the communications 
	system.

					HUMAN VOICE 
			This is Earth Orbital Control to 
			the unidentified Ferengi vessel, 
			do you need assistance?

					NOG 
			Yes. Definitely.

					HUMAN VOICE 
			We'll send a ship to tractor you 
			to a docking facility.

					ROM 
			We'll be waiting.

	Odo, Quark, Rom and Nog relax as they realize they've 
	made it home in one piece.

					ROM 
			Well son, it looks like you're 
			going to get to Starfleet Academy 
			after all.

					QUARK
			Just remember, under that placid 
			Federation veneer, humans are 
			still a bunch of violent savages.

					NOG 
			Maybe. But I like 'em.

	And as Quark shakes his head and Rom beams...

76   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)

	Re-establishing.

77   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR

	Quark, Rom and Odo return to the station.

					ROM 
			Ah, it's good to be home.
				(to Quark) 
			I bet you can't wait to see the 
			bar again.

					QUARK
				(dismissive) 
			The bar. I could've ruled the 
			galaxy. And now... I've got 
			nothing. I don't even have my 
			ship anymore.

					ROM 
			Look on the bright side, 
			Brother... You may've had to sell 
			your shuttle for salvage, but at 
			least you got enough to pay for 
			our passage home.

					QUARK 
			Wait 'til I get my hands on Cousin 
			Gaila.

	Odo takes Quark's arm and begins marching him off.

					ODO
			You're going to have to wait 
			longer than you think. Let's go.

					QUARK 
			What are you doing?

					ODO
			I'm taking you to a holding cell. 
			Kemacite smuggling is a serious 
			offense.

					QUARK 
			But you have no evidence. We used 
			all the rest of the kemacite to 
			get ourselves back to the twenty-
			fourth century.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Little Green Men" - REV. 09/20/95 - ACT FIVE   60.

77   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			Tell it to the Arbiter.

	And as Odo hauls Quark off...

					QUARK 
			I'm innocent I tell you... This is 
			all a misunderstanding... Rom, get 
			me a lawyer...

					ROM 
			I'll contact Cousin Gaila. I'm 
			sure he'll know a good one.

	And as Odo pulls Quark out the door...

					QUARK
				(as he disappears) 
			Rom, you idiot.

	Rom looks concerned for a beat, knowing he's done 
	something wrong, then figures he's done so many right 
	things lately, it doesn't really matter.

					ROM 
			See you in a few weeks, brother.

	Rom smiles to himself, and we...
