	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	at warp.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, stardate 45400.3.
			Two days ago, Starbase
			Five-one-four lost contact with
			the research vessel Vico, which
			was sent to explore the interior
			of a Black Cluster. We are
			en route to investigate.

2    INT. BRIDGE

	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON at the conn.

					ENSIGN FELTON
			Captain, we are entering sector
			nine-seven.

					DATA
			Sir, I am picking up massive
			gravitational fluctuations...

					PICARD
			Take us out of warp, Ensign.

					ENSIGN FELTON
			Yes, sir.

	Ensign Felton touches the panel.

					WORF
			The Black Cluster is in visual
			range.

					PICARD
			On screen.

					WORF
			Aye, Captain.

     STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - TEASER     2.

3    INCLUDE SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Everyone reacts to the awesome spectacle. A huge,
	black bending of space, seemingly an immense lens-like
	cloud, dotted throughout by tiny pulsars -- miniature
	stars that blink on and off like lighthouses or
	fireflies.

					RIKER
			Let's find that ship. Full sensor
			sweep, Mister Data.

					DATA
				(touching panel)
			Yes, Commander.

	Riker indicates the cluster.

					RIKER
			It's quite a sight.

					PICARD
				(nodding)
			One of the most ancient formations
			in the galaxy.

	Data looks up.

					DATA
			I have located the Vico. The
			vessel appears to be adrift.

					RIKER
			Let's see it.

	Data touches the console.

	The screen image shifts, and is replaced by a closer
	view: a mid-sized spacecraft, its hull sheared off in
	several places, hanging motionless against the starry
	background.

4    RESUME

	Everyone reacts to the sight.

					RIKER
			Life signs?

      STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - TEASER 3-3A.         

4    CONTINUED:

					WORF
			Nothing, Commander.

					RIKER
			Damage report, Mister Data.

					DATA
				(off instruments)
			The outer and inner hulls have
			been breached. Decks seven
			through twelve are exposed to
			space.

					RIKER
			Set up a translink to their
			computer core. Let's see what
			happened.

	Data tries a few commands.

					DATA
			I cannot, sir. The emergency
			bulkheads on that deck are in
			place. Our linkup signal cannot
			penetrate them.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			Structural status, Commander.

	Data hits a few controls on the console, looks at the
	results.

					DATA
			Stress readings indicate
			considerable pressure on the
			transverse supports.

					PICARD
			Is it stable enough for an away
			team?

					DATA
				(off instruments)
			Yes, sir. But the risk of
			structural collapse is high.

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			Have transporter room one maintain
			a lock on each member of your
			away team.
					(MORE)

     STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/17/91 - TEASER     4.

4    CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD (cont'd)
			I want you out of there at the
			first sign of trouble.

					RIKER
			Aye, Captain.
				(to conn)
			Ensign, take us to fifteen
			thousand meters.

					ENSIGN FELTON
			Yes, sir.

					RIKER
				(heading for door)
			Data, you're with me.

	Riker continues toward the turbolift, as Data gets out
	of his chair and joins him.

	OFF Picard, staring at the wreckage.

5    INT. VICO (OPTICAL)

	Riker, Data, and Geordi MATERIALIZE in a corridor-like
	chamber that has a couple of science consoles and small
	monitors against the wall. Data is carrying a small
	suitcase-sized, boxlike device. The corridor has been
	HEAVILY DAMAGED.

	Support beams are crashed through the ceiling, wall
	panels are exposed -- it looks like one false step will
	bring it all crashing down. When the away team moves,
	it is with great caution and awareness of their
	treacherous surroundings. They simultaneously spot
	a couple of bodies partially exposed beneath the
	rubble. Data takes out his tricorder and aims it
	toward the bodies -- but it only confirms what they
	already knew. The away team exchanges glances.

	Upon seeing the consoles, Data and Geordi start toward
	them -- suddenly a structural member shifts in the
	wall. The away team freezes. There is a metallic
	groan, a slight shake. And everything is again still.
	Data and Geordi again head for the consoles. One
	monitor is dead. The other is lit up, flickering,
	displaying a computer graphic of a graviton wave field.
	They touch the controls on both panels but nothing
	changes.

					DATA
				(re: dead monitor)
			This station is inoperable.

     STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - TEASER     5.

5    CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
				(re: his console)
			This one's stuck in a feedback
			loop.

					RIKER
			Let's try to tap directly into
			the computer core.

					GEORDI
			There should be an ODN junction
			along here somewhere...

	They all start scanning the area. Geordi spots a
	promising panel against the wall.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			This looks like a good
			possibility...

	He reaches down to take hold of the panel --

					RIKER
			Careful, Geordi. You don't want
			to pull out the wrong brick...

	Carefully, Geordi removes the panel -- revealing the
	fiber optic trunk within.

					RIKER
			Data.

	Data brings over the device. Sets it three feet in
	front of the ODN trunk and touches a control.

	A LASER type beam shoots out of the box, connecting to
	the trunk. Data tweaks the controls and the beam
	changes color.

					DATA
				(off colors)
			Core transfer is engaged.

	Geordi looks at the instrumentation on the device.

     STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/17/91 - TEASER     6.

5    CONTINUED: (2)

					GEORDI
			Exchange protocol verified.
				(takes reading)
			The files seem to be intact. Some
			of them, anyway.

					WEAK VOICE
			Is somebody there... ?

	All three react. Riker indicates the transfer device.

					RIKER
				(to Geordi)
			Stay here.
				(to Data)
			Data.

	He motions "follow me" with his head. Riker and Data
	cautiously move to the end of the damaged corridor and
	around the corner.

6    INT. SCIENCE SHIP CHAMBER - ON TIMOTHY

	a boy of ten. Trapped beneath a fallen bulkhead in an
	even more heavily damaged area. He looks up at Data
	and Riker -- panic on his face.

					TIMOTHY
			Are my parents alright?

7    RESUME RIKER AND DATA

	OFF their reactions.

									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER

	FADE IN:

          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            

8    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship is facing the crippled Vico, the Black Cluster
	in the background.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, supplemental. A
			young boy, shielded from our
			initial sensor scans, has been
			discovered alive by the away team.
			The degree of damage to the Vico
			is making our rescue attempt
			difficult...

9    INT. BRIDGE

	Picard, Worf, Ensign Felton.

					PICARD
				(to com)
			Transporter room one, can you lock
			onto him?

10   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Hutchinson at the controls.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			And transport directly to
			sickbay?

					HUTCHINSON
				(to com)
			I'll try, Captain...
				(doubtful)
			But there's a lot of shielding
			to pull him through.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE    7A.

11   INT. BRIDGE

					PICARD
			Acknowledged.
				(beat)
			Picard to Crusher.

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			Sickbay here, Captain.


     STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE     8.

11   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Standby for emergency transport.

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			Aye, sir. Crusher out.

					PICARD
				(to com)
			Picard to Commander Riker.

12   INT. VICO (OPTICAL)

	Data and Geordi are standing by. Riker is crouched
	down next to the trapped boy. Timothy appears almost
	numb with fright.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Is the boy ready, Number One?

					RIKER
				(to boy)
			Everything's gonna be okay...

	A beat. The boy doesn't answer. But he nods his head
	almost imperceptibly.

					RIKER
				(touching combadge)
			Ready, sir.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			At your signal.

					RIKER
				(to com)
			Aye, Captain.

	Riker again looks at the boy.

					RIKER
			Alright... here we go...

	Riker straightens up, backs away from the fallen
	bulkhead.

					RIKER
			Energize.

	The boy begins to DEMATERIALIZE.

12A  INT. SICKBAY

	Beverly watches as the boy MATERIALIZES in and out on
	a bio-bed.

     STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE     9.

13   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	Hutchinson works the controls. A few seconds go by...
	Hutchinson shakes his head.

					HUTCHINSON
				(to com)
			The lock is holding. I just can't
			resolve the matter stream. Not
			with all that victurium alloy in
			the way.

13A  INT. SICKBAY

	As Beverly watches the boy completely DEMATERIALIZES.

14   INT. VICO

	The boy MATERIALIZES back in place.

					HUTCHINSON'S COM VOICE
			Commander Riker. You'll have to
			get him out into the corridor.

	Riker exchanges a glance with Data and Geordi.

	All three of them look at the bulkhead trapping the
	boy. They glance up at the structural beams that are
	in turn braced against the bulkhead. It all looks
	heavy as hell -- and extremely unstable.

	Riker indicates the bulkhead.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			That's gotta weigh over a ton,
			Data. Can you move it?

					DATA
			Yes, sir. However, that may
			initiate the collapse of the
			surrounding supports. I recommend
			that you and Geordi return to the
			ship.

	A beat. Riker reluctantly nods.

					RIKER
			Agreed.
				(turning)
			La Forge...

	They both head back toward the open corridor.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT ONE    10.

15   TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	Riker and Geordi MATERIALIZE on the transporter pad.
	Beverly is standing near the transporter chief.

					HUTCHINSON
				(to Riker)
			I'm locked onto Commander Data
			and the boy, sir. I'll energize
			as soon as they've cleared the
			bulkheads.

					RIKER
				(keys combadge)
			Whenever you're ready, Data.

16   INT. VICO

	Data is standing next to the trapped boy.

					DATA
				(to com)
			Yes, Sir.

	He crouches next to the boy, who stares at him,
	wide-eyed, puzzled to see him up close, amazed at what
	Data seems to be attempting.

					TIMOTHY
			You're gonna lift that?

					DATA
			Yes. Then I will carry you to
			the corridor. We will transport
			back to the Enterprise from there.
			Do you understand?

	The boy is still amazed.

					TIMOTHY
			How can you pick up something so
			heavy?

					DATA
			I am an android. My strength is
			many times that of a human.

	A beat as Data considers an appropriate way to reassure
	the frightened boy -- recalls Riker's words.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT ONE    10A.

16   CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Everything is going to be... okay.

	Data puts one hand and shoulder to the bulkhead,
	leaving the other free.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE    11.

16   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			I will count to three.
				(beat)
			One... two... three...

	Everything happens at once:

	-- with his android strength, Data forces the bulkhead
	upwards. The boy scrambles free, falling to the floor.

	-- a second structural member collapses as a result of
	the action.

	-- Data drops the bulkhead, spins, scoops the boy into
	the air and dashes back toward the opposite corridor.

17   DATA (OPTICAL)

	shoots into the open corridor, boy under his arm,
	tapping his combadge with his free hand.

					DATA
				(to com)
			Energize!

	He and the boy DEMATERIALIZE -- a piece of the ceiling
	falls right through them.

18   INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)

	Data and the boy MATERIALIZE, standing on the floor.

19   INCLUDE BEVERLY AND AN N.D. NURSE

	Timothy looks up from the security of Data's shoulder,
	still in shock from the experience. He stares at the
	unfamiliar faces watching him. Timothy buries his head
	into Data's shoulder.

	OFF Data's reaction.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT ONE    12.

19A  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The wrecked Vico hanging near the Enterprise.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's Log, supplemental. A
			thorough search of the Vico has
			revealed no additional survivors.
			Troi has begun the process of
			counseling the boy in regard to
			the tragedy.

20   INT. SICKBAY

	Timothy is on his back on a diagnostic bed, eyes open.
	His hand is still gripping Data's -- the boy clearly
	refuses to let go. Timothy has an edgy look in his
	eyes, bordering on panic. Beverly and Troi are
	standing next to Data.

					TIMOTHY
				(in a rush)
			We were in the Black Cluster.
			I don't know where they came
			from... but they had a big ship
			-- they kept shooting at us. Then
			they beamed over. They had purple
			helmets on and phaser rifles.
			I saw them. But they didn't see
			me...

	He runs out of steam. Beverly checks the diagnostic
	reading above the bed.

					BEVERLY
				(gently)
			You're safe now, Timothy. You're
			going to be alright.

	Timothy gives her a blank look.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			You must be hungry. Would you
			like me to get you something to
			eat?

	Timothy nods. Beverly turns and heads for a
	replicator. Data turns to Troi.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT ONE    12A.

20   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Counselor, I must join Commander
			La Forge in engineering. If you
			will excuse me --

	Data attempts to gently retrieve his hand -- but the
	boy grips it ever the more tightly.

	Data stops in his tracks. He and Troi look at Timothy.
	The boy averts his eyes. A beat.

					TROI
			Timothy, would you like Data to
			stay a little bit longer?

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT ONE    13.

20   CONTINUED: (2)

					TIMOTHY
			Yes.

	Data glances at Troi, then back at the kid -- who is
	still keeping his eyes down.

	OFF Data's head tilt reaction.

21   INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)

	The away team's device is dumping its datastream into
	the computer console -- as before, the LASER makes the
	connection.

	Geordi is showing Picard a graphic of the wrecked Vico
	on a small monitor.

					GEORDI
			Sections of the primary and
			secondary hull were torn right
			off.
				(indicating)
			Shearing planes are here, here,
			and here.

	Picard studies the diagram.

	A beat.

					PICARD
				(re: datastream)
			How much longer until we can
			access their logs?

					GEORDI
			Less than an hour.

	Picard nods. He reaches toward the console and touches
	a command.

22   CLOSE ON: COMPUTER MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	as the external view of the damaged Vico is replaced
	by a cross-section graphic that exposes the interior
	architecture.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT ONE    14.

23   INCLUDE PICARD AND GEORDI

	as Picard studies the graphic and indicates a central
	area of the ship.

					PICARD
			The boy was here.

					GEORDI
				(nodding)
			The hallway outside the computer
			core.

	Geordi glances up at Picard.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			His mother was the ship's systems
			engineer.
				(beat; indicating)
			The second away team found her
			body here -- inside the core.

					PICARD
			And the boy's father?

					GEORDI
			Ship's second officer.
				(off diagram)
			He was most likely on the bridge
			when it was exposed to space.

					PICARD
				(grimly)
			Most likely...

	A beat as Picard studies the diagram, imagining what
	it must have been like. OFF the look on his face.

24   CLOSE UP - DATA'S HAND

	as Timothy's much smaller hand slowly loosens its grip,
	slipping out of Data's palm.

25   WIDEN TO INCLUDE - INT. SICKBAY

	Timothy is on his back in bed, eyes closed, having
	obviously just fallen asleep. Data takes a careful
	step back, joining Troi and Beverly, who are standing
	nearby.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT ONE    15.

25   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			He'll sleep for a few hours at
			least.
				(to Troi)
			There's no need to keep him here.
			But I will need to see him again
			tomorrow.

	Beverly looks at the boy for a moment.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing to Troi)
			You've got some work cut out for
			you.

	Troi nods her agreement with that assessment. Beverly
	moves to another part of sickbay, leaving Data and Troi
	still watching the boy.

					TROI
				(continuing to Data)
			His world is gone, Data. We're
			going to have to help him build
			a new one.

	Off the look between Troi and Data.

27   INT. ENGINEERING

	Geordi and Data are at their consoles.

28   ON GEORDI'S SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Alphanumeric bits of information flash by on the two
	screens. There appear to be major chunks of data
	missing -- blocks of blank space.

29   RESUME (OPTICAL)

					GEORDI
			This isn't good. I think whatever
			hit the Vico set up an E-M pulse
			that flashed through their
			computer banks.

					DATA
				(agreeing)
			Nearly eighty-three percent of
			the records have been lost.

					GEORDI
			And all of their sensor logs.
				(sighs)
			Let's use what we got from our own
			sensors. Call up the structural
			analysis and the surface scans...

	Data complies by keying in the appropriate commands
	-- the alphanumeric data is replaced by an Okudagram
	of the wrecked Vico. As they study the information...

					DATA
			Geordi, as a child, did you ever
			experience a traumatic event?

					GEORDI
			You're wondering about Timothy?

	Geordi thinks for a moment, remembering.

					GEORDI
			I was trapped in a fire once, when
			I was five -- before I got my
			VISOR. It only took about two
			minutes before my parents found
			me and pulled me out. And nobody
			got hurt. But I tell you -- that
			was the longest two minutes of
			my life. And it was more than
			a month before I would let my
			parents get out of earshot. I
			absolutely needed to know they
			were there.

					DATA
			Timothy no longer has that kind
			of support.

					GEORDI
				(sadly)
			Yeah...

30   INT. SCHOOL

	A TEACHER, male, late-twenties, is slowly walking past
	a beautiful painting of a multitiered, very
	alien-looking temple. He is carrying a PADD.

					TEACHER
				(reading)
			Dara and her brother found
			themselves in the land of Tagas...

	The teacher continues his slow pacing, passing a young
	girl, aged ten, who is following along in a PADD of
	her own.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT TWO    18.

30   CONTINUED:

					TEACHER
				(continuing)
			... where the ruler, Elamos the
			Magnificent, had proclaimed as
			law:

	He continues past several other children, also reading
	silently along in their PADDs.

					TEACHER
				(continuing)
			"No children will be tolerated
			within the Great Kingdom."

31   INCLUDE TIMOTHY

	who is working with a 24th-century equivalent of an
	erector set, adding to a large, three-foot-high model
	of the edifice depicted in the painting at the front
	of the classroom. He's ignoring the teacher entirely,
	his PADD on the floor next to him. His manner is
	intensely focused.

					TEACHER
				(continuing)
			When Dara saw the proclamation,
			she just laughed, saying "How
			magnificent a ruler, to be
			frightened by the likes of us... "

	The teacher pauses near Timothy, sees that the boy is
	still working on his model.

					TEACHER
				(gently)
			Timothy, we're done with sculpture
			for now.

	Timothy somewhat manically adds another piece to the
	temple.

					TIMOTHY
				(re: the model)
			It's not finished.

					TEACHER
			We'll come back to it next period.
			Why don't you pick up your
			mythology book and follow along?

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/17/91 - ACT TWO    19.

31   CONTINUED:

					TIMOTHY
			But it's not finished...

	Timothy increases his efforts -- which result in a
	somewhat lopsided addition to the model. It only makes
	him more agitated.

	The teacher looks at him for a moment, then glances
	across the room to a large window. Follow his gaze
	to --

32   TROI

	who is watching the classroom from behind a large
	observation window. The look on her face says "What
	can I do for this boy?"

33   INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE STATION (OPTICAL)

	Data and Geordi are showing Picard a monitor that
	displays a surface scan diagram of the Vico. All three
	are standing.

					GEORDI
			Magnetic residual analysis
			confirms that the Vico was
			attacked inside the Black Cluster.
			The graviton wave fronts pushed
			the ship to where we found it.

	Picard is looking at the information on the monitor.

					PICARD
			No sign of phaser burns on the
			hull.

					GEORDI
			No, sir. The torsional stress
			levels point to a disrupter-style
			weapon.

	Picard nods.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT TWO    20.

33   CONTINUED:

	Data touches the console and a color pattern overlay
	appears on the graphic.

					DATA
			Fracture points indicate that the
			energy burst came from a range
			of less than three thousand
			meters.

	A beat as Picard considers this.

					PICARD
			That's a strategy consistent with
			a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or
			Klingon... But we're quite a
			distance from either of their
			territories.

					DATA
			The Breen have outposts in this
			sector. The attack on the Vico
			is consistent with their battle
			tactics -- and their level of
			technology.

	Geordi nods in confirmation.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/17/91 - ACT TWO    21.

33   CONTINUED: (2)

	A long beat as Picard thinks about this.

					PICARD
			But what would they have been
			doing inside the Black Cluster?

	It's a question none of them can answer. Picard starts
	to walk along the back perimeter of the bridge, Data
	and Geordi walking with him.

					PICARD
			The boy described a boarding
			party, with helmets and phaser
			rifles.

					GEORDI
			A boarding party?

	A turbolift door opens and Troi steps out, within
	earshot.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			I don't think that's likely,
			sir...

	Picard reacts -- motions Troi over.

					PICARD
			Counselor...

	Troi does so as they pause near the turbolift. Picard
	nods to Geordi to continue.

					GEORDI
			There was absolutely no evidence
			of anybody coming on board the
			Vico. We would have found a
			transporter field trace. Or if
			somebody had used the entry
			ports, we would have found an
			electrostatic differential in
			the docking latches. We didn't.
				(beat)
			Maybe he's got an active
			imagination.

	Picard half turns to Troi.

					PICARD
			Or he's lying.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/17/91 - ACT TWO    22.

33   CONTINUED: (3)

					TROI
			If he is lying, I haven't been
			able to sense it. Perhaps his
			level of emotional trauma is too
			high.

					PICARD
			Why wouldn't he tell us the truth?

					TROI
			He's still in shock... it's hard
			to know what's going on in his
			mind.

					GEORDI
			I'll check the sensor readings
			again... but I'm almost sure we
			won't find anything.

	Geordi EXITS into the turbolift. Data starts to peel
	off toward his post -- but Troi stops him.

					TROI
			Data -- stay a moment.

	Data complies. Troi turns to Picard. A beat.

					TROI
			Captain -- I think we should ask
			Data to spend some time with
			Timothy.

					DATA
			I do not understand.

					TROI
			I'm worried about his
			behavior... And what you've just
			told me doesn't make me feel any
			better. Data, you're the only
			one Timothy's reached out to...
			because you rescued him. We can
			use your relationship with him
			to help his recovery.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/17/91 - ACT TWO    23.

33   CONTINUED: (4)

	A beat.

					PICARD
			Would Timothy also be more
			inclined to tell Data the truth
			about what happened?

					TROI
			That's a possibility.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			Mister Data, proceed with the
			child as Counselor Troi suggests.

					DATA
			Yes, sir.

	Picard turns and enters the ready room. Data turns to
	Troi.

					DATA
			Exactly how shall I proceed,
			Counselor?

					TROI
			Just be with him. You're a
			presence he trusts. That's what
			he needs most right now.

	OFF Data's bemusement.

35   INT. TIMOTHY'S QUARTERS

	Timothy is sitting alone at a table in his foster
	parents' quarters. Timothy is using the "erector set,"
	building the Dokkaran temple he was working at in the
	classroom.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT TWO    24.

35   CONTINUED:

	He works too quickly, agitated, and the result is a
	model that looks pretty sloppy.

	The door CHIMES. Timothy glances up. Doesn't answer
	it. He turns back to the model. The CHIMES ring
	again.

					TIMOTHY
				(impatient)
			What.

36   THE DOOR

	opens, revealing Data, who steps inside.

37   INCLUDE TIMOTHY

	who is glad to see who it is.

					TIMOTHY
			Data.

					DATA
			Hello, Timothy. May I enter?

					TIMOTHY
			Yeah.

	Data steps inside. He reacts to Timothy's tabletop
	creation, moving closer.

					DATA
			I see you are attempting to
			recreate the Dokkaran temple of
			Kural-Hanesh.

					TIMOTHY
			Isn't it great?!

	Timothy is hyperenthused.

					TIMOTHY
				(indicating)
			See, there's the big archway
			the teacher told us about.
			That's where everybody came in.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT TWO    25.

38   CLOSE ON THE MINIATURE CITY

	which is on the whole unbalanced -- the building leans
	precariously.

					TIMOTHY (o.s.)
				(continuing)
			That's where they stood. And
			that's where the altar was -- by
			the big windows.

39   RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)

	Timothy smiles proudly.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing)
			What do you think?

	Data is about to speak then catches himself.

					DATA
			Do you wish a frank evaluation?

	Timothy nods. Data considers for a moment, arrives at
	his honest opinion, innocently offered --

					DATA
			It lacks the harmony that
			characterized this particular
			temple and Dokkaran culture in
			general.

	Timothy looks crushed.

					TIMOTHY
			You hate it.

	He knocks over the tower-like structure he was
	struggling with at the top of the scene. Data reacts.

					DATA
			I am not capable of hatred.

					TIMOTHY
				(upset)
			I can't do anything right.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT TWO    25A.

39   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			You are making an unwarranted
			extrapolation. I was merely
			offering an aesthetic analysis
			of this particular model.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT TWO    26.

39   CONTINUED: (2)

	He manically puts together more pieces but it just
	makes things even messier.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing; re: the
				 mess)
			I told you.

	Timothy again makes an attempt. It doesn't work. He
	throws down what's in his hands.

	Data studies him for a beat.

					DATA
			Timothy... ?

					TIMOTHY
				(not looking up)
			What.

					DATA
			May I suggest a different
			approach?

	No answer, but Timothy is listening.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			You are attempting to construct
			the upper tiers before you have
			completed the lower.

	Timothy looks up at him.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Observe.

	Data begins to build a model of a building,
	constructing the foundation as Timothy watches.

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			La Forge to Data.

					DATA
				(to Com)
			Data here.

	Data continues working on the model.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT TWO    26A.

39   CONTINUED: (3)

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			I need your help with the shield
			modulators.

					DATA
				(to com)
			I will join you in a moment,
			Geordi. Data out.

	Data stops working. Timothy reacts.

					DATA
			Commander La Forge requires my
			assistance.

	Data moves to go -- but stops when he sees the
	disappointment on the boy's face. Data pauses, turns
	back to the model, and at DATA SPEED, quickly finishes
	the construction -- much to the boy's delight.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT TWO    27.

39   CONTINUED: (4)

					TIMOTHY
			Incredible.

	He looks at Data with admiration.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing)
			How come you can do that?

	Data starts for the door, Timothy tagging along.

					DATA
			I am designed to exceed human
			capacity both mentally and
			physically.

					TIMOTHY
			Androids are better than humans?

					DATA
			"Better" is a highly subjective
			term. I do not, for example,
			possess the ability to experience
			emotions as humans do.

					TIMOTHY
			No emotions? You mean you can't
			be happy or sad?

					DATA
			That is correct.

					TIMOTHY
			Why not?

					DATA
			My positronic brain is not capable
			of generating those conditions.

	FOLLOW them out the door.

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT TWO    28.

39A  EXT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	As they step into the corridor.

					TIMOTHY
			Can we build something else
			later?

					DATA
			That would be acceptable.

					TIMOTHY
			Bye.

					DATA
			Goodbye.

	Data turns and Timothy watches him enter the turbolift.
	When it closes behind him, Timothy maintains his stare
	for a few silent beats. FOLLOW him back inside.

39B  INT. TIMOTHY'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

	Timothy turns back to the model city, considers it for
	a moment.

	He turns away and goes to the mirror hanging on a
	nearby wall.

	He stares at his reflection. Then makes his face
	utterly impassive.

					TIMOTHY
				(Data-like)
			I am designed to exceed human
			capacity...

	He tilts his head in imitation of Data, watching the
	result in the mirror until he gets it right. Again,
	his voice is an imitation of Data's.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing)
			That is correct...

    STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT TWO    29.

39B  CONTINUED:

	OFF another head tilt, as -- in his own mind -- boy
	becomes android...

	FADE IN:

40   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise holding in space near the destroyed
	Vico, the Black Cluster in the background.

41   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, Troi. Data is in
	mid-report, on a nearby monitor is a graphic of the
	interior of the Black Cluster -- a dully glowing
	center, a dozen bright points scattered through it.

					DATA
			The Black Cluster was formed
			almost nine billion years ago when
			hundreds of protostars collapsed
			in close proximity. The resulting
			gravitational forces are violent
			and highly unpredictable.

					GEORDI
			To get anywhere near the center,
			we'll have to push through the
			gravitational wavefronts -- just
			like the science vessel was
			designed to do. I've adjusted
			our shields accordingly.

					WORF
			The gravitational forces will
			affect sensor accuracy. Detecting
			an enemy vessel will be difficult.

					RIKER
			Maybe that's what happened to the
			Vico -- they didn't see anything
			coming until it was too late.

	Picard considers this, turns to Troi.

					PICARD
			Has the boy volunteered any
			further information?

   STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT THREE   31.

41   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			No. But we have an appointment
			in less than an hour.

	Picard nods then glances at the graphic.

					PICARD
			If there's any possibility of
			getting more from him, I'd like
			you to pursue it.

	Troi nods. Picard glances toward the graphic display.

					PICARD
			Regardless, we need to continue
			our investigation.
				(beat, informing the
				 room)
			We'll enter the cluster at
			oh-seven-hundred tomorrow morning.
			Dismissed.

	As they rise to exit...

42   OMITTED

43   INT. CORRIDOR

	Troi stops at Timothy's door and touches the panel --
	we hear the CHIME. A few moments later, the door
	slides open, revealing Timothy.

					TROI
			Hello, Timothy. Are you ready
			to go?

	Timothy is wearing similarly styled and exactly the
	same color clothing as Data does. His face is
	impassive and android-like (his hair is still in his
	own style and color). Unlike the agitated condition
	he exhibited earlier, the boy is the essence of calm
	self-control.

					TIMOTHY
			Yes, Counselor. I am ready.

	The boy's uniform and his calm, almost formal tone of
	voice are not lost on Troi.

					TROI
			How are you feeling, Timothy?

   STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT THREE   31A.

43   CONTINUED:

					TIMOTHY
			I am functioning within
			established parameters.

	Troi considers this for a moment.

   STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT THREE   32.

43   CONTINUED: (3)

					TROI
			Established parameters? You
			sound like Data.

					TIMOTHY
				(of course)
			I am an android.

	Troi reacts

					TROI
			I see... Well. Let's go for our
			walk, shall we?

	Timothy makes a characteristically Data-like head tilt.

					TIMOTHY
			That would be acceptable.

	OFF Troi's face -- she's in for a ride.

44   INT. TEN-FORWARD

	Troi and Timothy are sitting at a table.

	A WAITER stands close by, waiting to take his order.

					TIMOTHY
				(to waiter)
			Androids do not need to eat or
			drink.

	A second waiter passes by with a tray full of
	attractive desserts -- Timothy reacts, then turns back
	to his waiter.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing)
			However, sometimes we like to
			taste things.
				(beat)
			A Tamarin frost, please.

	Timothy turns.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing)
			Would you like anything,
			Counselor?

   STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT THREE   32A.

	taking this all in, cautiously trying to deal with this
	new development.

					TROI
			No, I'm fine, thank you.

      STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE      33.

45   CONTINUED:

					TIMOTHY
			As you wish.

	The waiter turns and leaves.

					TROI
			So... you're no longer a Human?

	He cocks his head in pure Data fashion.

					TIMOTHY
			I'm an android.

					TROI
			When did this happen?

					TIMOTHY
			I've always been an android.

					TROI
			What's it like... being an
			android?

					TIMOTHY
			I am designed to exceed human
			capacity both mentally and
			physically. But I do not
			experience emotions.

	A beat as this registers on Troi.

					TROI
			You don't? No emotions at all?

					TIMOTHY
			That is correct.

	OFF Troi as she wonders how to deal with this.

46   INT. READY ROOM

	Picard, Troi, Data.

					PICARD
			An android.

   STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT THREE   34.

46   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			I know it sounds unusual - but
			it is understandable.
			Technically, it's called
			enantiodromia. Conversion into
			the opposite. Timothy went from
			Human to machine. From being
			emotional to being emotionless.
			But the underlying trauma is still
			there. He's just found a new way
			to repress it.

					PICARD
			How long will this behavior last?

					TROI
			As long as he needs it to.
			Timothy is rebuilding his identity
			as best he can. The android
			persona is only one step along
			the way. When he becomes stronger
			and more sure of himself, it
			should drop away naturally.

	Picard considers her words.

					PICARD
			I assume this is not a time to
			confront him about what happened
			to his ship.

					TROI
			Not yet. The best thing we can
			do right now is to let Timothy
			take us where he wants to go.
			We should support the process
			-- even encourage it.

	Picard nods, turns to Data.

					PICARD
			Mister Data -- I'd like you to
			make Timothy the best android he
			can possibly be.

	OFF Data's head-tilt reaction.

	doing a head tilt that EXACTLY MATCHES the one Data
	just performed.

STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE      34A.

48   INCLUDE DATA

	standing next to him. Timothy is sitting in a chair,
	the wall mirror behind him -- like an impromptu barber
	shop set-up. Data is holding a small comb and is
	eyeing Timothy's hair.

      STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE      35.

48   CONTINUED:

	Data attempts to put the comb to use, but the boy's
	android-like head tilts make it difficult -- it's like
	trying to hit a moving target. After a few attempts --

					DATA
			Timothy, your head movements
			are... counterproductive. Can
			you be still?

					TIMOTHY
			But you do it.

	Data reacts with a head tilt. Timothy mirrors it.

					DATA
			The servo-mechanisms in my neck
			are designed to approximate Human
			movements.
				(beat)
			I did not realize the effect was
			so... distracting.

					TIMOTHY
			I like it.

	Timothy does a couple more quick head tilts -- Data
	puts a hand on the crown of his head, holding him
	suddenly still.

					TIMOTHY
			Data, are there any other androids
			in Starfleet?

					DATA
			No. I am the only one.

					TIMOTHY
			How come you're not captain?

					DATA
			My service experience does not
			yet warrant such a position.

	Timothy nods. He's silent for a moment.

					TIMOTHY
			Data, what's the scariest thing
			that ever happened to you?

      STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE      36.

48   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			Fear is a quality that I do not

					TIMOTHY
			Because it's an emotion.

					DATA
			That is correct.

					TIMOTHY
			But what if you had a nightmare?

					DATA
			I have never had a nightmare.
			I do not require sleep.

	Timothy is silent. Data continues adjusting the boy's
	hair for a moment, then realizes something.

					DATA
			Timothy, are you having...
			disturbing dreams?

	Timothy doesn't answer right away. There's a sense
	that he's hiding something -- even from himself. He
	looks straight at Data.

					TIMOTHY
			I do not require sleep.

	Data looks at him for a moment -- he isn't going to get
	anything further out of him for now. Data finishes one
	last touch-up on the hair, then lifts the chair and
	turns it barber style to face the mirror on the wall.

	Timothy looks sleepy, like they've been going non-stop
	all day. Data is as fresh as always.

	The boy glances down at his palette and paint jars.

					TIMOTHY
			I ran out of red ochre.

					DATA
			You may use mine.

	Data hands him a jar.

			I'm fine.

				(continuing)
			Not bad.

			Thank you.

	a spacecraft ripped apart, but we can sense the feeling
	of one. The boy's trauma is making its presence
	known...

	Data reacts to the painting.

					DATA
			It is very... expressive.

					TIMOTHY
			Thank you.

	A beat. Timothy doesn't seem to be aware of what his
	own work suggests.

					DATA
			Is your painting representative
			of something?

					TIMOTHY
				(shrugs)
			It's just a painting.

	Timothy again yawns. Data thinks for a moment -- this
	is not his area of expertise and he knows to tread
	lightly...

					DATA
			Timothy, you understand that you
			may speak with me about anything

	Timothy again yawns.

					TIMOTHY
				(drifting)
			I understand...

	Data watches him for a moment, but nothing further is

			How did you know?

					GEORDI
			If I had a boy going around

					DATA
			I am not capable of being

					GEORDI
			You better define that for me,

					GEORDI
			I got you... the shoe's on the

	Data processes that briefly, glances curiously at his
	foot... then...

					DATA
			It is certainly not consistent

					TIMOTHY
			This is great. How's yours?

					DATA
			The complex polysaccharides, in

	A beat.

					TIMOTHY
			But how does it taste? Is it

					DATA
			I am not capable of "tasting" in

			However, I neither like it, nor

					TIMOTHY
			Oh. I didn't realize that.

	Data indicates the dessert.

					DATA
			I have often wondered what it must
			be like... to have one's mouth
			"water" in anticipation of the

			it...

	Timothy considers this for a second, staring at his
	soda.

69   CONTINUED:

					TIMOTHY
			You sound like you don't want to
			be an android.

					DATA
			I am an android. That will never
			change.

					TIMOTHY
			But... if you could change...
			would you?

					DATA
			I have always wished to be Human.
			I study people carefully in order
			to more closely approximate Human
			behavior.

					TIMOTHY
			Why? We're stronger and smarter
			than Humans... we can do more than
			they can.

					DATA
			But I cannot take pride in my
			abilities. I cannot take
			pleasure in my accomplishments.

	Timothy has begun scratching a little place in the
	table with the tip of his spoon. He concentrates on
	this task as though it were the most important thing
	in the world.

					TIMOTHY
			But we never feel bad, either...

					DATA
			I would gladly risk feeling bad
			at times... if it meant that I
			could also taste my dessert.

	Timothy glances up, very quickly, at Data. Then he

					PICARD
			Our sensors and our phasers --

				(to Data)
			This reflection phenomenon --
			would it have the same effect on

					DATA
			Yes, sir. Disruptors would be

					PICARD
			And a ship's cloaking field?

					DATA
			It would be extremely difficult

	An intense blurring of space is billowing toward them

			Wavefront intensity has increased

			additional power to the shields,
			the outer hull will not hold...

91A  ON DATA AND TIMOTHY (OPTICAL)

	Data looks like he's thinking at lightning speed
	evaluating the numbers that scroll past him on the
	monitor.

			Warp transfer to the shields
			complete. That's as strong as
			they're gonna get.

	As everyone reacts to the words.

					WORF
			Impact in fifteen seconds.

	As the seconds count down, Data works like mad at the
	console. He taps in one last command. Data looks up
	from his console, alarmed.

					DATA
			Drop the shields.

	Everyone reacts.

					RIKER
			That's suicide, Data.

					DATA
			Captain, drop the shields.

	The wavefront fills the screen, Picard makes a split
	second decision, trusting their lives to Data.

					PICARD
				(to Worf)
			Drop the shields.

					WORF
				("what?!")
			Aye.

	As Worf executes the command, the wavefront breaks
	across the screen. Everybody hangs on...

	Contact. A slight BUMP -- nothing more.

	Everyone is taken aback by the turn of events. They
	all look toward Data for the explanation.

					DATA
			Our own shields caused the
			increase in the wavefronts...
			we induced harmonic
			amplification effects.

					RIKER
			The more energy we dumped into
			the shield grid, the worse the
			impact...

					DATA
			Precisely. And that is also what
			destroyed the Vico. When Timothy
			remembered similar procedures
			aboard his ship, I initiated an
			analysis of shield output to
			wavefront amplitude and discovered
			a correlation.

					PICARD
			If we had transferred all that
			warp power to the shields, it
			would've torn the ship apart.

	A silent beat.

					RIKER
			Status, Ensign.

					ENSIGN FELTON
			Navigation is coming back on line.

					PICARD
			Full about, one quarter impulse.
			Take us out of here.

	The Ensign nods and executes the commands. OFF

	at warp in normal space.

98   INT. CLASS ROOM - ON TIMOTHY

	at the edge of a scattered group of kids, fiddling with
	an experimental setup. He is no longer in "android"
	mode. His hair is back to normal, he wears clothing
	more appropriate to a child.

	A little girl -- his "lab partner" -- hands him a small
	piece of metal and he takes it, attaching it to the
	apparatus they're building. He's fitting in -- but
	still seems very tentative and fragile.

					TROI (o.s.)
			It would seem that our young
			"android" is finding his way back
			to humanity.

99   ON TROI AND DATA

	watching from behind the window.

					DATA
			It would appear so, Counselor.

					TROI
			It'll take a while for his
			emotions to catch up. Timothy's
			a boy feeling a great deal of
			pain. But he is a boy again.

	Data considers her words. She glances at him... A
	beat...

					TROI
			Is this.. difficult for you, Data?

					DATA
			Difficult?

					TROI
			To watch him... moving away from
			being like you...

        STAR TREK: "Hero Worship" - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT FIVE        59.

99   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			No, Counselor. That would require
			an emotional context which I
			cannot provide.

	A long beat. OFF the moment...

	still working on the class assignment.

					DATA (o.s.)
			Hello, Timothy.

101  INCLUDE DATA

	as Timothy turns toward him.

					TIMOTHY
				(flat)
			How are you, Data?

					DATA
			I am operating within established
			parameters. How are you?

					TIMOTHY
			I'm fine.

	The boy looks away, almost embarrassed. Data picks up
	on it.

					DATA
			Is something wrong?

					TIMOTHY
			You probably thought I was pretty
			silly. When I had my hair like
			yours and everything.

					DATA
			On the contrary, it is said that
			imitation is the highest form of
			flattery. I was... flattered.

	Timothy lightens up considerably.

101  CONTINUED:

					TIMOTHY
			Can we still do things together
			-- even if I'm not really an
			android?

					DATA
			I have many Human friends. I
			would be pleased to count you
			among them.

					TIMOTHY
			That would be...

	Timothy smiles -- the first time we've seen a genuine
	child's smile.

					TIMOTHY
				(continuing)
			...acceptable.

	OFF the moment.
