                            TEASER                              

	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	racing through space at warp speed.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, Stardate 41209.2.
			We are running at Warp 7 to
			rendezvous with the science vessel
			S. S. Tsiolkovsky...

2    FULL ON WHITE DWARF (OPTICAL)

	with the S.S. Tsiolkovsky in orbit. Then the Enterprise
	appears and moves in to join the research vessel.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... which has been routinely
			monitoring the collapse of a red
			supergiant star into a white
			dwarf. What has brought us here
			is a series of strange messages
			indicating something has gone
			wrong aboard the research vessel.

3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	All regulars on duty -- Data at Ops, Geordi at Conn, Tasha
	and Worf upstage intent on main viewer which shows the
	Enterprise moving in parallel with the research vessel.
	First, a STATIC GARBLE, then a WOMAN'S VOICE over the
	audio channel, low and insinuating. INDISTINCT VOICES,
	LAUGHTER, IN B.G. indicate the SOUNDS OF A NOISY PARTY.

					WOMAN'S COM VOICE
			Well, hello Enterprise.
			Welcome... I hope you have a lot
			of pretty boys on board... because
			I'm willing... and waiting...

	They wait for more, then Picard nods toward Data.


          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87          2.

3    CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(touches com panel)
			S.S. Tsiolkovsky, repeat your
			message.

					WOMAN'S COM VOICE
				(laughter, then)
			In fact... we're going to have a
			real blowout here... Thought that
			would interest you. Waiting!

	She LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY. There is MORE LAUGHTER FROM
	THE OTHERS, some cries of "DO IT! GO AHEAD!" in b.g.
	of the transmission, an EXPLOSIVE SOUND -- and then
	silence. After a beat:

					DATA
			Captain... what we just heard is,
			well...impossible.

					PICARD
			Report.

					DATA
				(quietly)
			I believe that last sound we heard
			was an emergency hatch being
			blown.

	The subspace channel is still open -- all we HEAR is
	the HISS OF EMPTY AIR.

					PICARD
			Are you certain... yes, of course
			you are.

	Riker comes to his feet fast, gets a nod from Picard,
	motions for Data, Geordi and Tasha to follow him to the
	turbolift.

					WORF
			Sensor scan now reveals no life
			signs aboard, Captain.

4    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

	The away team consists of RIKER, GEORDI, DATA, TASHA,
	and a SECURITY GUARD. Data and Geordi have tricorders;
	Tasha has the large phaser.

					RIKER
			Put us on their bridge, Chief.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87          3.

4    CONTINUED:

					TRANSPORTER CHIEF
			Life support systems are not
			functioning in that area, sir.

	Riker nods to the TRANSPORTER CHIEF at the console.

					RIKER
			Then put us in the main corridor.
			Energize.

	The Transporter Chief works his console controls deftly.
	As the TRANSPORTER EFFECT AND SOUNDS BEGIN AND BUILD:

5    INT. TSIOLKOVSKY MAIN CORRIDOR - ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

	The TRANSPORTER EFFECT COMES IN, FADES DOWN, leaving
	the away team materialized. The ship is very quiet --
	a low HUM of working equipment, but without the murmur
	of living beings.

					RIKER
			Cover the ship as planned. Move
			out.

	Data and Geordi put tricorders on "record" and all move
	out.

6    INT. SECOND CORRIDOR - ON RIKER AND DATA (OPTICAL)

	This corridor shows signs of phaser char marks on the
	walls. There is litter on the deck -- food, a wine
	bottle, discarded clothes. Data records the scene with
	his tricorder, as:

					DATA
			Indications of what humans would
			call... a "wild party?"

	Riker has moved quickly to a door at the end of the
	corridor. It is shut, but there is a small viewscreen
	set in the wall beside it.

					RIKER
			Their bridge. If this thing
			works, be sure to record ---

	He activates the viewscreen, takes a look, and GROANS.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          4.

7    CLOSE SHOT - SMALL VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Narrow view of a small bridge (SET FRAGMENT), mostly
	consoles, maybe a command chair. And beyond these, the
	emergency hatch set in the bulkhead -- the hatch is
	gone, and the cold glitter of a starfield winks beyond
	it. (SET DRESSING NOTE: There should be no loose
	objects visible, only items that are firmly anchored
	to deck or bulkhead. Anything loose would have been
	swept into space when the air rushed out into the
	vacuum.)

8    WIDER SHOT - RIKER AND DATA

	Riker steps aside, gesturing to Data to record the scene
	on the viewer as:

					RIKER
			You were right. Somebody blew
			the hatch and they were all sucked
			out into space..

					DATA
			Correction, sir, blown out.

					RIKER
			Thank you, Data.

					DATA
			A common mistake, sir...

					RIKER
				(emphasis)
			I know! Thank you, Data.

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			Commander Riker, it's Lieutenant
			Yar, location Engineering. Ten
			people here, sir, all frozen.
			No vital signs.

					RIKER
				(touches communicator)
			Frozen how?

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			Looks to me like someone was
			"playing" with the environmental
			controls, sir. Just let all the
			heat bleed away into space.

					RIKER
				(to Data)
			That's ridiculous!

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			That's what I say, sir.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          5.

9    INT. PERSONNEL QUARTERS - ANGLE ON ENTRY DOOR

	as it opens heavily and causes a slight AIR HISSING.
	Geordi ENTERS from the corridor, reacts to the AIR
	HISSING, hits a wall control on the inside. His
	expression changes to one of dismay as he looks around.

10   ANOTHER ANGLE

	CAMERA ANGLE REVEALS a room partially covered with
	frost. We glimpse several male and female bodies,
	scantily clad or (implied) nude, possibly a couple
	entwined. All are frozen and dead. Bits of frost-covered
	lingerie and other intimate clothing are
	scattered around. Geordi touches his insignia.

					GEORDI
			Sir, Lieutenant La Forge in the
			crew quarters. Something in here.

11   BACK TO GEORDI

	as he HEARS A SOUND, the BUMP BUMP of a door bumping
	against the jamb. Geordi hurries across the small room
	toward the adjoining bathroom.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			Hello!

12   INT. BATHROOM - ANGLE ON GEORDI

	Nothing inside, Geordi decides to check the closed
	shower stall, yanks the door open -- and a frozen
	WOMAN'S BODY, fully clothed, falls out into his arms.
	Although startled, Geordi has the presence of mind to
	catch the ice-covered corpse and lower it to the floor.

13   CLOSER ON GEORDI

	Examining the frozen woman who had once been attractive,
	shakes his head in pity. He rests one hand on the wet
	side wall of the shower to brace himself as he prepares
	to stand upright again.

14   VERY CLOSE ON GEORDI'S HAND AND "DROPS" (INSERT))

	Several drops of "water" on the icy shower wall where
	Geordi's hand rests coalesce and move onto his
	hand (per Justman effect).

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          6.

15   INT. TSIOLKOVSKY MAIN CORRIDOR - EMPHASIZING RIKER

	as he uses his communicator.

					RIKER
			Riker to Captain, I have a report
			for you.

16   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PICARD

	Worf at Ops (port) and crewman at Conn (starboard).

					PICARD
				(tabs com control)
			Picard here.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			They're all dead, sir. Some were
			apparently blown out the emergency
			hatches.

					PICARD
			There were eighty people on that
			ship, Number One.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Yes sir. As I said, all dead.

	Picard looks incredulous.
									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER                          

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          7.

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

17   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)

	The Tsiolkovsky still drifts in space. The Enterprise
	is nearby. Over this:

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are downloading the research
			information gathered on the
			collapsing...

18   CLOSE ANGLE ON DWARF STAR (OPTICAL)

	looking somehow strange, unstable, although we'd see
	no surface movement at this range.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... star nearby. I am concerned
			at being in such close orbit, but
			the Tsiolkovsky's research
			records...

19   INT. ENTERPRISE MEDICAL CORRIDOR

	with Picard striding toward Dr. Crusher's office.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... will no doubt predict the time
			of the star's final collapse.

20   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON BEVERLY, PICARD AND TROI

	Beverly is examining information as it comes up on a
	desktop viewer. (NOTE: We see only the back of the
	viewer and the flicker of light on her face as the
	information changes.) Troi is there too, also watching
	the screen.

	Picard ENTERS, strides over to examine the viewing
	screen too.

					BEVERLY
			I can't find anything unusual in
			any of the tricorder readings
			they've sent over, Captain.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          8.

20   CONTINUED:

	Picard straightens up, and Beverly turns around to look
	at him.

					PICARD
			Give me a theory, Doctor.
			Anything!

	Beverly's silence is eloquent. She shakes her head,
	her face has a worried look.

					PICARD
				(turning; continuing)
			Troi? Did you feel anything from
			over there?

					TROI
			Perhaps some residual
			confusion... and exhilaration, too.
			But I'm not too certain of that.

					PICARD
			Madness? Mass hysteria?
			Delusion?

					TROI
			Any or all, Captain.

					PICARD
			All right. Let's bring the away
			team back. Set the transporter
			for maximum decontamination. And
			then full examinations and
			observation when they're here.

	He turns and heads for the door.

21   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)

	as before.

22   INT. ENTERPRISE SICKBAY - BEVERLY, RIKER, GEORDI,
	DATA

	Data is just getting up from one of the hospital beds
	as:

					BEVERLY
			If you were any more perfect,
			Data, I'd write you up in a
			Starfleet medical textbook.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          9.

22   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			I am already listed in several
			biomechanical texts, Doctor.

	Beverly doesn't quite yet know how to take Data. Riker
	does, and grins.

					BEVERLY
			Yes... of course.
				(to Geordi)
			You're next, Lieutenant.

	Data LEAVES. Geordi obligingly lies down on the
	hospital bed, and Beverly starts to monitor him with
	a small instrument.

23   ANGLE ON MEDICAL VIEWSCREEN

	The readings come on -- nothing radical anywhere.

24   WIDER ANGLE

	as Beverly looks up at the o.s. viewscreen, then:

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			Normal -- all across.
			Except... why are you perspiring?

	Geordi appears to have a fine sheen of perspiration on
	his face.

					GEORDI
			I suppose because you have it too
			hot in here. What else would it
			be?

	Both Beverly and Riker have reacted to this un-Geordi
	reply.

					RIKER
			That doesn't... sound exactly like
			you, Geordi.

	Geordi looks up, then replies pleasantly, grinning.

					GEORDI
			Maybe it wasn't.
				(indicates Beverly)
			Maybe she threw her voice.

	He means it as a joke but no one is amused.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87         10.

24   CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			Joke.

					BEVERLY
			Of course. But I would like to
			run another test or two on you,
			Lieutenant.

25   INT. MAIN BRIDGE AND CRUSHER'S OFFICE (INTERCUTS)

	as Picard turns to his panel.

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			Sickbay to Bridge...

					PICARD
			Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor.

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			I'm confining Lieutenant La Forge
			to Sickbay until further notice.

					PICARD
			Do we have a problem, Doctor?

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			I don't know yet.

26   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

	as Riker ENTERS from a turbolift and crosses toward
	Data, who is working at one of the science stations at
	the rear of the Bridge. All other Bridge Personnel are
	in place -- Picard, Tasha, Worf at Ops, Crewman at
	Conn.

27   CLOSER TWO SHOT - RIKER AND DATA

	Data looks up as Riker approaches him.

					RIKER
			Data, I need help in locating some
			library-computer information.

					DATA
			Specifics, sir?

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87         10A.

27   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			All I have is a vague memory of
			reading somewhere about someone
			taking a shower in his or her
			clothing.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/2/87          11.

27   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Ah. The body Geordi discovered.

					RIKER
			And I believe it may have happened
			before.

					DATA
			To "someone," "somewhere."

					RIKER
				(amused)
			Should be easy for someone written
			up in biomechanical texts.

	Data shrugs, enters a command on the panel, and
	information begins to flash up on a small viewscreen.
	(Viewscreen may be o.s.)

					DATA
			About that... did the doctor
			believe I was boasting?

					RIKER
				(dryly)
			Probably.
				(indicates viewer)
			This may take some time?

					DATA
			At least several hours.
				(looks up)
			But what I said was a statement
			of fact.

	Riker begins EXITING.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Perhaps she will look it up.

					RIKER
			You can depend on it.

28   INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON GEORDI AND BEVERLY

	He is resting on a hospital bed. Beverly finishes
	working over him with a medical instrument, checks a
	reading on it, moves toward her office. (NOTE: At no
	time does she touch him.)

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/2/87          12.

29   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON BEVERLY

	She sits down at her desk, compares readings on the
	medical instrument with something she has called up on
	the viewer.

30   INT. SICKBAY - ON GEORDI

	He sits up, takes off his communicator and lays it to
	one side. Then he gets to his feet, and quietly EXITS
	the Sickbay. A moment, then Beverly comes back IN --
	stares at the empty bed, snatches up Geordi's
	communicator and runs for the door.

					BEVERLY
			Geordi!

31   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SICKBAY - ON BEVERLY

	The door slides open and she stands there, agitatedly
	staring up and down the corridor.

32   BEVERLY'S P.O.V. - THE CORRIDOR

	empty.

33   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON TASHA

	as she hears an ALERT SIGNAL from her panel.

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			Security! Lieutenant La Forge
			just left Sickbay while my back
			was turned. It's important we
			find him.

					TASHA
				(toward console)
			Security team alert, pick up
			Lieutenant La Forge who left
			Sickbay moments ago.
				(calling toward Picard)
			Captain, anything further?

					PICARD
			Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide
			search, Lieutenant.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/2/87         12A.

34   INT. CRUSHER'S QUARTERS - ANGLE ON WESLEY AND
	GEORDI

	The boy is in the living space, near a table littered
	with delicate futuristic tools.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/1/87          13.

34   CONTINUED:

	He has an intricately shaped tube attached to a miniature
	control device. It is a MINIATURE TRACTOR BEAM (OPTICAL).
	As Geordi watches, Wesley is using the device to maneuver a
	chair in the air.

					WESLEY
			It's a model of the same kind of
			tractor beam our ship uses... with
			some ideas of my own added.

	He hoists the chair higher, floats it sideways, lets
	it settle to the deck. Geordi is fascinated.

					GEORDI
			So that's your science project.
			Wes, you are something!

					WESLEY
			Meanwhile, the captain won't let
			me visit the bridge.

	Wesley goes to the littered table, pulls out a
	transparent cube, slides it into a slot on a small flat
	(portable) machine.

					WESLEY
				(continuing)
			So I use this to imagine I'm
			there.

	Wesley touches a control and a light goes on at the tiny
	machine.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			Take the helm, Mister Crusher.
			Set a course for thirty-seven mark
			one hundred eighty. Warp six.

					GEORDI
				(indicates)
			That's the captain's voice.

					WESLEY
			Pieced together from words he's
			used on the intercom.
				(indicates)
			I can pretend he's ordering me
			to take the Enterprise anywhere.
			And listen to this...

	Wesley touches another control.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87         14.

34   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD'S VOICE
			Chief Engineer, report to the
			Bridge. Commander Riker, report
			to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher,
			report to the Bridge.

					WESLEY
			What d'you think?

	Geordi puts a friendly arm about the boy's shoulder.

					GEORDI
			I think the captain's lucky you're
			on his side.

					WESLEY
			But he still won't let me on the
			bridge. And there's nothing there
			I don't understand.

					GEORDI
			Wish I understood myself that
			well.

	Wesley turns at the "down" note in Geordi's voice.

					WESLEY
			You okay?

					GEORDI
			No. Suddenly I seem to be burning
			up inside.

	Geordi stands, moves for the door.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			Wow it's hot in here.

	Geordi EXITS leaving a puzzled Wesley inside.

34A  INT. CORRIDORS

	Tasha and Security Personnel searching for Geordi.

35   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - ANGLE ON GEORDI

	perspiring, upset. Looking out to space.

					TASHA'S VOICE
			Geordi... ?

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         15.

35   CONTINUED:

	She ENTERS SCENE from behind him, looking for a reaction

					TASHA
				(continuing)
			Medical's been worried about you.

					GEORDI
				(without turning)
			Help me.

	Tasha studies him a beat. He seems so sad, so lonely.
	Then:

					TASHA
			Lieutenant Yar in the Observation
			Lounge. Send a team here now.

	After a beat, Geordi swings around to look at her, pain
	and longing chasing across his face.

					GEORDI
			Tasha... I said "help me." Help
			me not to give in to the wild
			things coming into my mind...

	Tasha is moved, tries to fight it off.

					TASHA
			Geordi -- my job is security...

					GEORDI
			Please.

	Tasha folds him into arms.

					TASHA
			Yes, helping is more important.
			How can I help you Geordi?

36   INSERT - TASHA'S HAND

	being patted by Geordi's hand.

37   BACK TO SHOT

	A Security Guard hurries into the room, stops as Tasha
	motions him to a halt.

					GEORDI
			Help me to see like you do.

37   CONTINUED:

					TASHA
			But you already see better than
			I can.

					GEORDI
			I see more. But more isn't
			better!

	He tears off the prosthesis, exposing eyes that have
	flat gray irises with no pupil, incapable of expression.

					TASHA
			Geordi...

					GEORDI
			I want to see in shallow, dim,
			beautiful human ways.

					TASHA
			We'll talk about it, Geordi.
				(takes his arm)
			I'm going to take you to Sickbay
			now. All right?

	He bobs his head, willing to be assisted. As she leads
	him away:

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

38   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)

	The dwarf star in view too.

					PICARD (V. O.)
			Captain's log, supplemental. I
			am concerned that away team member
			Lieutenant La Forge has been taken
			to Sickbay. The report: "unusual
			behavior."

39   INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY, GEORDI, TROI

	Geordi is lying on a hospital bed still struggling to
	control his emotions, while Beverly works her medical
	instruments over him, glancing up now and then at the
	o.s. viewscreen to check the results. Troi is assisting
	the monitoring.

40   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON TASHA AND PICARD

					TASHA
			... and then we got him down to
			sickbay so Dr. Crusher could
			examine him.

					PICARD
			He wasn't violent?

	She glances over her shoulder back toward the treatment
	room.

					TASHA
			No, sir. He was very upset... he
			kept talking about wanting normal
			eyes.

					PICARD
			Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll be
			in Sickbay.

	Picard HURRIES OUT immediately. It's clear he has much
	on his mind. Tasha moves to EXIT, then pauses.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         18.

41   CLOSE ON TASHA

	wiping a hand over her lightly perspiring brow. As she
	EXITS, it is clear she feels strange somehow.

42   INT. SICKBAY - ON BEVERLY, GEORDI, TROI, PICARD

	Beverly administers a hypospray to Geordi, which finally
	begins to calm his emotional state. As Picard joins
	them, Beverly turns and indicates her medical
	viewscreen.

					BEVERLY
			According to our medical readouts,
			there's still nothing wrong with
			him. He looks like he's running
			a temperature but every instrument
			we have says he's not.

					PICARD
			Doctor, every person on that ship
			over there died. Is there any
			chance that whatever did it is
			loose on my ship?

					BEVERLY
			If you mean a disease, sir, I'd
			say there's no chance of it. We
			used full decontamination, we
			examined each team member
			carefully...

					PICARD
				(interrupting)
			The entire crew over there somehow
			managed to kill themselves,
			Doctor. If it wasn't a disease,
			what else could have made them
			do that?

					BEVERLY
			The obvious alternatives would
			be in areas of insanity, severe
			emotional upset...
				(stops short; to Troi)
			Troi, do you feel anything unusual
			in the lieutenant here?

					PICARD
				(to Troi)
			Security reported he was longing
			for normal eyesight. A rather
			sudden yearning for that.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         19.

42   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Since his records show no previous
			mention of that, the fact that it's
			happened now could be important.

	Troi centers her attention on Geordi, mentally probing.
	Then:

					TROI
				(continuing)
			But all I feel from him is
			confusion. If I didn't know
			better, I'd say he was
			intoxicated.

	The Captain throws a quick look toward Beverly who
	shakes her head firmly.

					BEVERLY
			Our tests would have shown that.
			Also any signs of drugs,
			hallucinogens or other
			contaminants.

43   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER AND DATA

	still at the science station, Data's fingers flying over
	tabs on the console. He looks at the viewscreen, shakes
	his head. Worf and Crewman as before.

					DATA
			Can you provide more information,
			sir? Seeking an instance of
			someone showering with their
			clothing on is...is...

					RIKER
			I know... like looking for a needle
			in a haystack.

					DATA
				(puzzled)
			Why should anyone wish to expend
			their time in such a search?

					RIKER
			Correction, Data, I should have
			said proverbial needle in a
			haystack.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         20.

43   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Ah, a human proverb! As in
			folklore, or an historical
			allusion, or tribal memories,
			or...

					RIKER
				(interrupting)
			That's it! Historical! I
			remember now that I was reading
			a history of all the past
			starships named Enterprise.

	Data takes over the console, quickly tabbing in commands
	as:

					DATA
			Enterprise history. Aberrant
			behavior. Medical cross
			reference...

44   ANGLE TO INCLUDE TURBOLIFT

	as Picard ARRIVES, CROSSES toward his Bridge position.
	Riker sees him, calls:

					RIKER
			Captain, I believe we've got the
			answer to what happened over
			there.

45   ANGLE AT VIEWER

	where Data continues refining the information he's
	getting. Riker is watching over his shoulder as Picard
	moves in to examine the information too.

					PICARD
			The Constitution class Enterprise,
			Captain James T. Kirk
			commanding...

					RIKER
				(indicates viewer)
			Similar conditions. They were
			monitoring a planet that was
			breaking up, not a collapsing star
			as in this case, but there were
			the same huge shifts in gravity...

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/1/87          21.

45   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(peers closely)
			... which somehow resulted in
			complex strings of water
			molecules which then acquired
			carbon from the body and acted
			on the brain like alcohol!
				(to Data)
			Mister Data, download that
			information immediately to
			medical.

					DATA
			Aye sir, downloading.

	Picard and Riker both study the information on the
	viewer.

					PICARD
			Fascinating! Their entire crew
			going out of control...

					RIKER
			Like intoxication but worse.
			Judgment almost completely
			impaired...

					PICARD
			Until they found this formula,
			barely in time.
				(moves to his own
				 console)
			Picard to Doctor Crusher, come
			in.

	After a moment:

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			This is Crusher; go ahead Captain.

					PICARD
			You can relax, Doctor. The answer
			to all this is feeding into your
			medical banks now... including a
			cure.

	A long beat, then:

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			Are you certain, Captain?

					PICARD
			Absolutely!

	Data has looked up with a slight pained expression at
	Picard's "absolutely."


         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         22.

46   INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - ON TROI

	Troi's quarters are tastefully decorated, including a
	scattering of art objects that may be Betazoid in origin
	-- perhaps a wall hanging, a unique piece of pottery
	or statuette, or paintings. At the moment, there are
	also a number of lovely dresses and gowns draped over
	the furniture. Troi ENTERS and stops inside the door,
	staring.

					TROI
			Tasha?

47   INCLUDING TASHA

	She is somewhat agitated and has a light sheen of
	perspiration as she holds one of Troi's gowns against
	her, judging it for color. The size, of course, would
	be all wrong for her.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			What're you doing?

					TASHA
			I need your advice. That's why
			I came to your quarters.

					TROI
			Of course. Anything I can do ---

					TASHA
				(interrupting)
			On clothes. You always wear such
			beautiful clothes off duty. And
			your hair's so nice all the time.
			I want to change my image.
				(holds up dress)
			What about this color?

					TROI
			Not for you. Tasha, I feel you're
			very uncertain... that you're
			fighting something.

	She reaches out to take Tasha's hand comfortingly.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			What is it?

	Tasha pulls her hand away, tosses down the dress, and
	moves to the door as:

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         23.

47   CONTINUED:

					TASHA
			Never mind. I'll find what I need
			myself. Ship's Stores will have
			it.

					TROI
			Tasha, wait ---

	Tasha LEAVES. Troi immediately touches the com panel.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			Troi to Captain Picard.

48   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON PICARD

					PICARD
			Picard here.

					TROI'S COM VOICE
			Sir, I think Tasha's been
			infected, too. She's just left
			my quarters...

					PICARD
			It's not actually an "infection,"
			Counselor.

					TROI'S COM VOICE
			Yes sir, it's more like
			intoxication, but whatever it is,
			she's got it.

49   ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND DATA

					PICARD
			Thank you, Counselor.
				(to Riker)
			Number One, our security chief
			has the equivalent of a snootful.

					DATA
				(to Picard)
			Inquiry, sir... 'snootful?'

					PICARD
			Forget it!

50   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON BEVERLY

	She is checking the lab report on Geordi against
	information on her viewscreen when:

					WESLEY (V.O)
			Mom, Look what I can do...

	She turns, gets to her feet in alarm and hurries into
	the treatment room.

51   INT. SICKBAY - INCLUDING WESLEY AND BEVERLY (OPTICAL)

	Wesley again has the tractor beam on and is balancing
	several medical instruments in mid-air all at the same
	time. We can also SEE he's perspiring a bit.

					WESLEY
				(continuing)
			I've been able to widen and
			strengthen the beam, just like
			I told you last night ---

					BEVERLY
			Do me a favor, Wes? There's
			something happening on this
			ship...
				(shrugs)
			Just to be safe, I'd like you to
			stay in our quarters until it's
			solved.

					WESLEY
				(slightly silly grin)
			Right, Mom, right. Your wish
			is my...

					BEVERLY
			Now, Wes.

	Wesley lowers the floating instruments and turns off
	the little tractor beam as:

					WESLEY
				(another grin)
			You could be stunting my emotional
			growth, you know.
				(wipes forehead)
			Why's it so hot in here, anyway?

	He heads for the door. Beverly pauses, thinking about
	his words a moment, then has to forget it as:

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         25.

51   CONTINUED:

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Picard to Crusher. Have you made
			a test injection yet? We're
			getting indications that this
			condition is spreading.

					BEVERLY
			No test yet, Captain, but very
			soon.

52   INT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE ON A VERY SHAPELY REAR END

	moving down the corridor with a most provocative sway.
	CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the shapely rear end belongs
	to Tasha, and she is moving with the sexiest walk
	imaginable -- quite unlike her usual straightforward
	stride. Her whole expression has acquired a sexy pout.
	She approaches an intersection where several crewpersons
	are passing. Then, we HEAR GIGGLES, then a woman's
	LAUGHING SCREAM.

					TRANSPORTER CHIEF
			Come to Papa; come to Papa... !

	MORE LAUGHTER as A CREWMAN chases a CREWWOMAN around
	the corner and into the other corridor. Other crew
	odd behavior.

53   WIDER ANGLE

	From the reactions of the crewpersons in sight it is
	obvious that some have been infected and some not.
	Another CREWMAN is coming from the other direction and
	pauses as he sees Tasha swaying sexily toward him,
	openly flirting. She stops in front of him.

54   TASHA AND CREWMAN

	She reaches out to pull him a little closer and plants
	one hell of a kiss on him. As he returns it:

55   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

	As Picard returns to his chair, Data moves toward him.

					DATA
			Captain, in another forty-one minutes
			will see the information from the

			Why so slow?

					DATA
			Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has
			been eight months in accumulating
			it.

					PICARD
				(indicates viewer)
			How much danger from that star?
			Worse case.

56   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The collapsing star centered on the screen in the midst
	of very slow motion surface explosions.

					DATA (V.O.)
			Like a full collapse, sir?

57   BACK TO TWO SHOT - PICARD AND DATA

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Any stellar material it threw this
			way we could still outrun on half

58   ANGLE AT MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as before, the slow surface explosions on the collapsing
	star continuing from the last viewscreen SHOT.

59   INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	CHIEF ENGINEER SARAH MACDOUGAL and her ASSISTANT CHIEF
	JIM SHIMODA are working in the office at their consoles.
	They both glance up as the BOSUN'S WHISTLE SOUNDS, then:

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Picard to Engineering. Chief
			engineer report to the bridge.

	MacDougal shakes her head, EXITS the office. Shimoda
	turns back to his console.

59   CONTINUED:

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
				(continuing)
			Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda
			report to Medical.

	Shimoda hesitates, looks around the empty office. A
	beat... then Wesley ENTERS the office, carrying the small
	flat portable machine we saw earlier.

	We should also SEE the small tractor beam device with
	tube and fiber optic wire attachment.

					WESLEY
			Hi, Jim. Was that the captain
			sending you to Medical?

					SHIMODA
			Which would leave no one on duty
			here. The chief was just
			summoned to the bridge.

					WESLEY
			What about me? I could call your
			chief on the bridge if anything
			happens.

	He smiles at Shimoda... and wipes some sweat from his
	brow.

60   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD AND
	MACDOUGAL

	Picard looks around curiously as MacDougal approaches
	the command chair:

					MACDOUGAL
			Reporting as ordered, sir.

					PICARD
			What?

					MACDOUGAL
			You ordered me to report to the
			bridge, sir.

					PICARD
			I did no such thing. I want you
			down in the Engine Room in case
			we need to move out of here.

	Interrupted by a Bosun's WHISTLE ALERT:

70   INT. TASHA'S QUARTERS - AT DOOR

	The living space is low lit, provocative shadows. There

	quite sure of himself.

					DATA
			Lieutenant Yar?

					TASHA'S VOICE
			Here, Data.

71   ANGLE ON TASHA

	in the door to her bedroom. Her hair is provocatively
	arranged... her makeup is especially dramatic and
	attractive... and she wears a pale blue diaphanous
	Theiss creation that promises revelations that will get
	us thrown off the air. Her voice quality has changed
	too... sultry, like a Louisiana summer night.

					TASHA
				(continuing)
			You wanted me?

72   TWO SHOT

	Tasha moves languidly toward Data, almost floating.
	Data doesn't quite know how to react to this Tasha.

				(considering it, then)
			I am sure he meant "now."

					DATA
			Chronological age? No, I am afraid

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Can you short out the power?

	Riker looks to MacDougal. She shrugs.

					MACDOUGAL
			Maybe.
				(considers)
			Yes, I can. But it's going to
			take time.

77   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PICARD

	Concerned.

					PICARD
			Do it!

78   INT. ENGINEERING - ON RIKER AND MACDOUGAL

	as they pull a panel off the console opposite the
	Engineer's Office entry, and MacDougal starts to reach
	inside. From their right, there is the SOUND of
	turbolift doors and:

					TROI'S VOICE
			Bill...

79   INT. CORRIDOR TO ENGINEERING

	as Riker comes to her.

					RIKER
			Deanna, what -- ?

	She reaches for him before he can stop her, holds him
	tight.

					TROI
			So many minds on this ship,
			Bill... all free... released...

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         36.

79   CONTINUED:

	Her hands move sensuously on his back, her body closer
	to his.

					RIKER
			Deanna --

					TROI
			I can feel them all... what they
			feel... what they want... I feel
			a side of humans I've never felt
			before.

					RIKER
			Come on, I'm getting you to
			Sickbay.

	He catches her up in his arms, carries her toward the
	turbolift as:

					TROI
			Wouldn't you rather be alone with
			me -- with me in your mind...

80   INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY

	She has a large beaker or futuristic-shaped container
	from which she is loading a hypo-spray. The hypo-spray
	filled, she moves across to where Geordi La Forge lies
	still strapped on the hospital bed. He is awake now,
	his face a picture of desolation. Beverly administers
	the hypo-spray and steps back to observe.

					BEVERLY
			The medical records we found say
			this works almost instantly.

	Geordi lies still, staring at the ceiling. Then:

					GEORDI
			I've never seen a rainbow, Doc.
			Sunset. Sunrise. None of those.
			This is going to help me?

	Beverly stares at Geordi, horrified as realization
	comes. It doesn't work.

81   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY AND DWARF STAR
	(OPTICAL)

	No movement at all.

82   INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON RIKER AND TROI

	as he carries her into the treatment area, lays her down
	gently on a bed next to Geordi's.

					RIKER
			Doctor Crusher...

	He turns, looking for Beverly. She does not appear.
	He hurries into her office.

83   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON BEVERLY AND RIKER

	She is sitting at the desk, desolate. Riker COMES IN
	behind her, puts a hand on her shoulder to shake her
	slightly.

					RIKER
			Didn't you hear me? Deanna needs
			your help.

					BEVERLY
			The formula from the old
			Enterprise didn't work.

					RIKER
			What?

					BEVERLY
			This water-carbon complex may
			induce the same symptoms, but it's
			different somehow. Maybe it's
			mutated. I'll have to isolate
			it... analyze it...

					RIKER
			We don't have that kind of time.

	She suddenly snaps around, realizing something.

					BEVERLY
			You brought Deanna in?

					RIKER
			She's infected with it, too.

	He heads for the door. Beverly is on her feet
	anxiously.

					BEVERLY
			You touched her? Oh, God, you
			touched me.
				(then)
			You can't leave here --

83   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			If we don't get our command
			computers back on-line soon, this
			-- whatever this is -- won't
			matter. We'll all be dead.

	On Beverly's despairing face:

									FADE OUT.

84   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY, DWARF STAR

	As before with very slow (at this distance) flaring from
	the star.

					PICARD (V. O.)
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			It is no longer an inconvenient
			childish prank. Young Wesley
			Crusher...
				(beat; softening)
			Admittedly a victim of the
			Tsiolkovsky "infection"...

85   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	Showing a SHOT of Wesley in the Engineering office.
	Also at the Bridge are Worf at the Ops position and
	crewman at Conn.

					PICARD (V. O.)
				(continuing)
			... is now in control of my
			starship. How he acquired the
			engineering information and
			knowledge he is using, I have no
			idea.

86   ANGLE ON PICARD

	staring up at Wesley's IMAGE on the main viewer.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Wes, this is Captain Picard. Do
			you see me?

87   VARIOUS ANGLES (OPTICAL)

	as Wesley looks up and around, focuses his attention
	onto camera (the captain). Although showing the same
	contaminant symptoms as others, he speaks respectfully.

					WESLEY
			Yes sir?

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         40.

87   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			You will now return all control
			of this vessel to the bridge where
			it belongs. Now.

					WESLEY
			I'm sorry, sir. Why don't you
			just tell me what you want done
			and I'll...

					PICARD
				(interrupting)
			Because ship captains control
			their own vessels, young man!

					WESLEY
			But, sir, you don't do it
			yourself. You give the orders,
			someone else does it. What's
			wrong with giving me the orders
			to do it?

	Worf and Conn have exchanged looks during this although
	Conn has begun to perspire and appears uncomfortable.
	Worf sees something unusual on his console, interrupts
	Picard.

					WORF
			Captain, getting unusual readings
			now from the dwarf star... !

					PICARD
			Stand by a moment on that.
				(toward main viewer)
			Wesley... !
				(softens it)
			Wes... are you aware that you're
			acting strangely... that a kind
			of "infection" was brought back
			from the Tsiolkovsky that acts
			like intoxication?

					WESLEY
				(considers it)
			Are you saying that's why I feel
			so... so "hot," so strange?

	Picard wants to shout back "of freakin' course!" but he
	controls himself.

					PICARD
			That's a very adult bit of
			reasoning, Wes...


         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         41.

87   CONTINUED: (2)

					WESLEY
			Are you saying I'm "drunk?" I
			feel strange but also good.

					PICARD
			Because...
				(corrects his tone of
				 voice)
			Because you've lost the capacity
			for self-judgment. Alcohol does
			that but this contaminant we've
			brought back does it even more
			so.

					WESLEY
			What would you do if you got your
			ship back?

					PICARD
			It's very important I do because
			we must immediately put a tractor
			beam on the Tsiolkovsky, then tow
			it out of...

					WESLEY
			Tractor beams are my specialty,
			Skipper! I'll contact you when
			that's done; Wesley out!

	With which the VIEWER GOES DARK, and then is replaced
	with a view of the dwarf star. It is in the midst of a
	gigantic FLARE.

					PICARD
			Wes!

	Conn gets up from his position now, weaves toward the
	turbolift.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Conn, where are you headed?

	No answer. Conn will EXIT by turbolift as:

					WORF
			Sir!
				(indicating viewscreen)
			The star; it's beginning to
			collapse.

					PICARD
			What the hell is happening in
			Engineering?

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - Rev. 6/26/87         42.

88   INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ANGLE ON WESLEY AND
	SHIMODA

	Wesley is working some controls on one of the consoles,
	singing:

					WESLEY
			Lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock
			on... lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock
			on...

	Behind him, Shimoda still sits on the floor, playing
	something like "jacks" with the isolinear optical chips
	from the computer, scooping up the chips in orderly
	groups -- 1, 2, 3, etc.

89   INT. ENGINEERING - ON MACDOUGAL AND RIKER

	They work together at the console opposite the entrance
	to Engineer's Office, probing deep into the guts of the
	console. A small array of tools lies between them, which
	they share.

					MACDOUGAL
			You got the logic probe?
				(he hands it to her)
			Thanks.

					RIKER
			Where's the sonic driver?

	She grunts and gestures at the spread of tools. Riker
	looks, finds it, dives into the console again. MacDougal
	works quickly, steps back.

					MACDOUGAL
			There. Let's see if this'll cut
			out his tractor beam power.

	She reaches inside the console and switches something.
	She and Riker both turn to look behind them.

90   ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW INTO ENGINEER'S OFFICE
	(OPTICAL)

	Wesley grins cheerfully. The TRACTOR BEAM is STILL AIMED
	AT THE DOOR.

91   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON BEVERLY

	She grimly works at a futuristic microscope, then
	becomes aware that she is wiping perspiration from her
	face.

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87         43.

91   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Oh no! No, I must find the answer.
			Find the answer. Have to find
			the answer.

	She reaches for another slide but handles it confusedly.

92   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)

	as a tractor beam appears.

93   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON WORF

	still at Ops. No one at Conn. He whirls around.

					WORF
			Captain -- tractor beam! We just
			locked onto the Tsiolkovsky!

					PICARD
			Bridge to... to Wesley.
				(waits; then)
			Wesley Crusher, come in!

	One of the turbolift doors HISSES OPEN and Data ENTERS
	the Bridge. Picard whirls to him.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Data! At least you're
			functioning.. !

					DATA
			Fully, Captain, fully.

	But it obvious from the look on his face and his weaving
	movements that Data is not at all himself.

					PICARD
			Data, intoxication is a human
			condition. Your mind is
			different, it's not the same...

					DATA
			We are more alike than unlike,
			my dear captain.

94   EMPHASIZING DATA

	He is examining the backs of his hands with great
	interest.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/1/87          44.

94   CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(continuing)
			I have pores. Humans have pores.
				(turns hands over)
			I have fingerprints. Humans have
			fingerprints. My chemical
			nutrients are like your blood.
				(looks appealingly at
				 Picard)
			If you prick me, do I not leak?

95   ANGLE TURBOLIFT

	which opens and Beverly Crusher ENTERS the Bridge.

					PICARD
			If this can possibly wait,
			Doctor...

					BEVERLY
			May I see you in your Ready Room?
			It's a private matter... well,
			actually an urgent one...

					PICARD
			I'm busy, Doctor. Impossible.

	But Beverly EXITS Bridge into Ready Room. Picard
	FOLLOWS.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Damn!

95A  INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM

	Picard ENTERS, finds Beverly waiting. She has a slight
	smile on her face.

					BEVERLY
			I believe I'm infected myself.

	Beverly steps toward Picard, suddenly GIGGLES. It's the
	same high pitched sound we've heard from some others.

					PICARD
			Do you know what the infection
			is? Hurry!

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87         45.

95A  CONTINUED:

	Picard realizes that Beverly is beginning to smile at
	him a bit sexily. She tries to stop doing so. All this
	is complicated for her by the fact she has begun lately
	to find this man increasingly attractive.

					BEVERLY
			Sorry.
				(wipes off smile)
			It is definitely like alcohol
			intoxication, the same lack of
			good judgment...
				(smiling sexily again)
			For example right now, I find you,
			well, extremely...extremely...
				(stops)
			Of course we haven't time for that
			sort of thing...

					PICARD
			What sort of thing?

					BEVERLY
				(eyeing his body)
			Oh God would I love to show you.

					PICARD
			Doctor, there must be a cure!
			Some formula, similar to the old
			one...

					BEVERLY
				(holding Picard's hand)
			Dammit... dammit, dammit, my dear
			captain. You owe me something.
			You do realize that, don't you?
			I'm a woman; I haven't the comfort
			of a husband, a man...

					PICARD
			Not now, Doctor, please...

	Then he's alarmed to find himself GIGGLING, wiping
	moisture from his forehead.

96   ANGLE EMPHASIZING WORF

	On the Bridge, Ready Room door in b.g. He turns
	as Picard and Beverly EMERGE from the Ready Room.
	Beverly ENTERS the nearby Turbolift, turns and waves
	"bye-bye." Picard fights the urge to giggle, waves
	back. The doors close. Picard, very irritated at
	self, regains control. Worf presses his intercom.

					WORF
				(low)
			Bridge to Riker, urgent!

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87         46.

97   INT. ENGINEERING - RIKER AND MACDOUGAL

	He looks up, his hands still deep in the console.

					RIKER
			Riker here.

			Sir, regret to inform you that
			the captain appears to be
			infected. And Data, and...

					RIKER
				(all he needs)
			Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm coming.
				(to MacDougal)
			You'll have to handle this.

					MACDOUGAL
			Are you saying you'll handle that?

98   EXT. SPACE - DWARF STAR FOREGROUND (OPTICAL)

	In the midst of a great flaring surface explosion, slow
	at this distance but obviously enormously powerful.

99   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING WORF

	Reacting as he sees the results of this on his readouts,
	then whirls to the Main Viewer. Red alarm lights flash.

100  MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	The star's surface clearly changed by this great flaring
	explosion.

101  ANGLE AT COMMAND POSITION

	Picard very concerned at what he is seeing; Beverly
	reacting to his concern; even the bemused Data watching
	it with some interest. Beverly turns, CROSSES toward
	the turbolift where she will EXIT. As Riker ENTERS.
	Meanwhile:

					WORF
			What we're seeing, sir, is a huge
			chunk of the star's surface blown
			off, heading for us!

         STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87         47.

101  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Take us...
				(wipes perspiration)

					RIKER
			Are you alright, sir?

					PICARD
			Worf, you know what to do. Take
			us out of here.

	Worf works controls, gets nothing, leaps over to the
	Conn panel and works something and then comes back to
	Ops and does more. Still nothing.

					WORF
			Sir, the controls are still off-line!

					PICARD
			Override!

					WORF
				(tries, then)
			Same result, sir.

102  INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - EMPHASIZING SHIMODA

	Wesley watches while Shimoda attempts to put together
	a structure (like LEGOS) composed of the isolinear
	optical chips. They both ignore:

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Wes, come in please. Wesley
			Crusher, this is Riker. Come in.
			This is urgent!

103  INT. ENGINEERING - MACDOUGAL

	Red alarm lights are flashing. MacDougal twists
	something inside the open panel.

106  INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	MacDougal surges in. Wesley and Shimoda merely look
	at her. Wesley's very sad. Game's over.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Engineering, urgent. We must have
			ship's power...

	MacDougal ignores him, pushes past them toward the
	computer consoles. The optical chips go flying as
	Shimoda dodges out of her way.

					MACDOUGAL
			Oh, no, those are control
			chips... !
				(finds a com button)
			Bridge from Engineering...

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			The star is still collapsing;
			we're directly in the path of...

107  INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Both Picard and Data fighting against the contamination
	as Riker mans the main console.

					MACDOUGAL'S COM VOICE
			I can't help you, bridge!
			Someone's yanked out all the
			control chips here...

					WESLEY'S COM VOICE
			It was an adult who did it!

					WORF
			I estimate fourteen minutes until
			that mass gets here... !

					MACDOUGAL'S COM VOICE
			No way to replace chips in
			fourteen minutes, sir. I'd guess
			two hours, maybe three...

					WESLEY'S VOICE
			Data could assemble them back
			faster.

	Picard seems to come out of it a bit. He looks up:


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87             49.

107  CONTINUED:

			What's that?
				(hits a com control)
			What's that Wesley?

					WESLEY'S COM VOICE
			They're just simple isolinear

	still tied by the tractor beam, motionless. Riker's
	voice reveals the strain he is under.

					RIKER (V.O.)
			Ship's log, First Officer Riker.
			The star has begun disintegrating.
			Enterprise will be destroyed
			unless it can be moved out of the
			path of the star material
			hurtling...

109  EXT. SPACE - EXPLODED MASS OF MATERIAL (OPTICAL)

	It is large, irregularly shaped, moving very fast as it
	was hurled off the star's surface with more power than
	a hydrogen bomb. To gain a sense of size, it should
	BLOCK OUT A WHOLE SECTION OF THE STARFIELD as it PASSES
	CAMERA.

					RIKER (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... toward us. Our only hope is
			for Lieutenant Commander Data in
			the time we have left, to regain
			his senses and reconnect engine
			power to the Bridge.

110  INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ON MACDOUGAL

	She is on her knees on the floor, vainly trying to sort
	out which optical chips belong where.

111  ANGLE ON RIKER AND DATA

	as they ENTER FAST. MacDougal looks up at Riker,
	helplessly indicates the chip chaos. Data smiles at
	Wesley, who grins back cheerfully. Both are still
	smashed.

					WESLEY
			Hi, Mister Data.

					DATA
			Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87             51.

111  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(overlapping; urgently
				 indicating)
			Data! We need the engines on-line
			in a hurry, remember?

	Meanwhile, Riker is now beginning to perspire like
	others who have been "infected."

					WESLEY
			Oh yes, I remember too.
				(to Data)
			So, Data, if you don't mind...

					RIKER
				(fast; to Wesley)
			We've no time for courtesy!
				(fast; to Data)
			Get those damned control chips
			back in place, Data! In the
			correct order!

	Data hesitates, surprised at Riker shouting at him.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			NOW!

					WESLEY
				(to Data)
			It's like a game of 'how fast can
			you do it?'

					DATA
			Ah, a game!

	Data begins selecting chips, beginning to move more and
	more rapidly. Wesley moves to the Engineering Room
	viewer, adjusts the controls there.

					WESLEY
			I think I can switch this to the
			main viewer, sir...

112  ANOTHER ANGLE - VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	as it switches to a SHOT OF THE STAR MATERIAL IN

			We've got eight or nine minutes,
			at most, Data. Can you finish
			by then?

114  ANGLE EMPHASIZING DATA

	If necessary, UNDERCRANK CAMERA now to show Data's hands
	are moving very fast. He seems to be calculating Riker's
	questions, then shakes his head without looking up:

					DATA
			No. This will take slightly more
			time than we have, sir.

	Riker becomes aware that his hand is wet, realizes he is
	"infected" too.

					RIKER
			Dammit, NO! I can't afford to
			get it!

	He stands, sways, grabs for support.

115  EXT. SPACE - MASS OF MATERIAL FROM STAR (OPTICAL)

	hurtling through space -- too fast.

116  INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON BEVERLY

	She has a batch of blue liquid made up and is examining
	it. Picard ENTERS on the run.

					PICARD
			Beverly...

					BEVERLY
			Yes, Jean-Luc?

					PICARD
			You will address me as Captain!

	They too still show signs of the "intoxication." Beverly
	has begun to fill a hypo-spray with the blue liquid.

					BEVERLY
			In which case, dear Captain, you
			will address me as 'Chief Medical
			Officer' or 'Doctor.'


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87             53.

116  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(befuddled; then)
			That's true; I started off calling
			you 'Beverly,' then naturally,
			you...
				(shakes head)
			I'm still not thinking straight!

	Having filled the hypo-spray, Beverly turns with it to
	go somewhere but forgets where.

					BEVERLY
			Likewise. Where the hell was I
			just headed?

					PICARD
				(indicates hypo)
			If that's something you wanted
			to test...

					BEVERLY
				(suddenly remembering)
			Yes, yes, on Geordi!

	Weaving a bit, she hurries off with Picard following in
	the same way.

117  INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - THREE SHOT

	Riker and MacDougal standing over Data, who concentrates
	on the chips. Wesley has moved to his school project
	tractor beam, eyes it proudly.

					WESLEY
			Did you see how I reversed fields
			on this, Commander? Made it into
			a repulser beam.

	Riker ignores the question, watches Data, concerned.

118  CLOSE ON DATA AND HIS HANDS

	UNDERCRANK CAMERA. His hands are flying -- almost a

120  CLOSE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The mass of star material closer, hurtling toward them.

121  WIDER ANGLE

	Wesley reacts at the nearness now of the star material.
	Then looks at his tractor device.

					WESLEY
			If this were a hundred times more
			powerful than it is...

122  INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON GEORDI

	as Beverly administers the hypo to Geordi with Picard
	looking on.

					BEVERLY
			I made this a broader based

			close to the formula from the old
			Enterprise's records...

					PICARD
			Decades ago, light years away...

					BEVERLY
			But almost exactly the same
			conditions as here.

					GEORDI
			What was in that, Doctor? My
			head's beginning to clear...

	Both react to the sight of Geordi beginning to sit up
	alertly. Beverly whirls, injecting Picard... then
	herself. She presses the hypo on him.

					BEVERLY
			Take this to Engineering. I'll
			make up more hypos for the others.

123  INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE

	as before but with Riker gloomy now. Data and Wesley
	continuing work. But Wesley is struck with an idea,
	leaps to the Engineering Room control board.


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87             55.

123  CONTINUED:

	Eyes it, then:

					WESLEY
			Why not try it with the real
			thing?!
				(to MacDougal)
			Why not reverse fields on this,
			Ma'am? If we only need an extra
			minute...

					MACDOUGAL
			It would take weeks of laying out
			new circuits...

124  EMPHASIZING WESLEY

	studying the Engineering Room board.

					WESLEY
			But why not just see it in your
			head?
				(thinks, presses
				 switches)
			Come off the main lead, split at
			the force activator,
			then...then...
				(puzzled)
			If I could just think straight
			about this...

125  WIDER ANGLE

	as Picard bursts in, presses his hypo against MacDougal,
	then Riker, then another person, etc.

					RIKER
			We didn't make it, Captain. If
			we had just a minute or so more...

126  EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)

	with the star material looming large as it rushes down
	upon them.

127  INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ON WESLEY

	His fingers begin to dance on the panel.


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/2/87              56.

127  CONTINUED:

					WESLEY
			Yes, then reversing power leads,
			back through the force
			activator... repulser beam hard
			against the Tsiolkovsky...

128  EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)

	The Tsiolkovsky now begins drifting to one side,
	beginning to spin clear with the Enterprise moving away
	from it.

129  INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - WIDE ANGLE

	Riker eyes the viewer in surprise.

					RIKER
			We're pushing away!

	Data lifts his hands from the command computer board.
	The isolinear optical chips GLOW on the board.

					RIKER
				(continuing; into
				 communicator)
			Bridge, engage engines!

130  EXT. SPACE - TSIOLKOVSKY AND MASS OF MATERIAL
	(OPTICAL)

	The mass of material crashes into the Tsiolkovsky. Her
	warp and impulse engines EXPLODE SIMULTANEOUSLY on
	impact in a mighty BLAZE OF LIGHT. But Enterprise is
	accelerating out of trouble.

131  INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

	Geordi at Conn now. Relief. Beverly is there still
	administering hypo injections. The red alarm lights
	have stopped.

					GEORDI
			Sir, something seemed to move us
			aside at the last minute.

					WORF
				(into his com)
			Do we owe our thanks to Commander
			Data, sir?


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/2/87              57.

131  CONTINUED:

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Yes. And... Wesley may have given
			us a few seconds, too.

					WORF
			Did he say Wesley? The boy?

	Beverly nods with a pleased look.

					BEVERLY
			He said Wesley.

132  INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE

	Picard sees Riker smiling at him. He scowls, begins
	to EXIT.

					RIKER
			It is only fair to mention Wesley
			in a log entry, sir.

					PICARD
				(stops; nods)
			Fair is fair. And let's credit
			his science teacher, too.

	Picard EXITS; Riker follows him.

133
thru	OMITTED

135  INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PANNING

	Picard, Riker and Data ENTER from the Turbolift and
	move toward their positions. Worf at Ops and Geordi
	at Conn positions turn with pleased expressions.

					GEORDI
			Congratulations, sir.

					PICARD
			To many people.

	During which Troi and Tasha also ENTER from Turbolift
	now, move to their positions. Tasha is back to normal,
	wearing her regular duty uniform, hair and makeup as
	stringent as usual. Data sees, nods.


              STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/2/87              58.

135  CONTINUED:

	Data starts to turn away but Tasha has colored, turns
	toward him.

					TASHA
			Data! I'm only going to tell
			you this just once... It never
			happened.

	Data gives her a very puzzled look, goes to position
	still puzzling over it.

136  OMITTED

137  ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

	as he sits in his position, looks around the Bridge.

					PICARD
			I put it to all of you we may end
			up with a fine crew... if we keep
			working at it.
				(nods for emphasis;
				 then)
			So let's get to our next job,
			Number One.

					RIKER
			Aye, sir. Helm, stand by for warp
			three. Heading two-hundred
			ninety-four mark thirty-seven.

					GEORDI
			Warp three, two-hundred
			ninety-four mark thirty-seven,
			sir.

					RIKER
			Engage!

138  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE

	Accelerating into WARP SPEED.

									FADE OUT.

                            THE END
