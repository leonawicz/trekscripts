                   In the silence preceding the Paramount Logo, in simple

                   THE LEGEND FADES OUT.


            .....................................................................


                   FADE IN:    
 
               1   SPACE - A STARFIELD - ILM                                    1 

                   A HORN sounds the STAR TREK FANFARE, and we begin to
                   MOVE FORWARD. MAIN TITLES begin. And to the delight
                   of Star Trek lovers everywhere, the MUSIC OVER the
                   early credits is the SERIES THEME by Alexander Courage.
                   We're in for a classic, good old Star Trek time. But
                   hold on...

                   After the first 16 bars and early CREDITS, the music
                   trails off ominously into silence -- and a faint new
                   SOUND. At the same time, we pick up a speck of light
                   coming toward us from deep space. As the SOUND GROWS,
                   the speck begins to assume shape and form.

               2   CLOSER - THE PROBE - ILM                                     2

                   A simple cylinder, non-threatening but huge in size,
                   with odd, eye-like antennae. It emits the SOUND, a
                   long synthesized gibberish, foreign to our ears. The
                   SOUND STOPS; the antennae rotates; the SOUND is heard a
                   second time, then stops. As the probe slowly passes us
                   we hear:

                                           FEMALE VOICE
                             What do you make of it?

                                           MALE VOICE
                             It appears to be a probe, Captain.
                             From an intelligence unknown to us.

               3   SPACE - THE STARSHIP SARATOGA - ILM                          3

                   A RELIANT class vessel.

                                           FEMALE VOICE

                   She is a concerned Starfleet professional. Her male
                   SCIENCE OFFICER stands beside her. CREDITS RESUME.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Starfleet Command, this is USS
                             Saratoga patrolling Sector 5,
                             neutral zone. We are tracking a
                             probe of unknown origin on apparent
                             trajectory to the Terran solar
                             system. Attempts to communicate
                             with the probe have been negative on
                             all known frequencies.

                                           STARFLEET VOICE
                             Continue tracking, Saratoga. We will
                             analyze transmissions and advise.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Roger, Starfleet, Saratoga out.

                                     (GIBBERISH starts)
                             Here it comes again.

                   The CALL, louder this time. As they listen, the Bridge
                   lights begin to dim.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             What's causing that!?

                                           SCIENCE OFFICER
                             Captain, their call is being carried
                             on an amplification wave of enormous
                             power!

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Can you isolate the wave?

                                           SCIENCE OFFICER
                             Negative. It's impacting on all our
                             systems!

                   Even as he speaks, the GIBBERISH increases in volume
                   and the lights on the bridge dip lower.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Yellow alert! Shields up. Helm,
                             reduce closing speed!

                   The Helmsman attempts to comply. Nothing works.

                                           HELMSMAN
                             Captain, Thruster controls have been
                             neutralized!

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Emergency Thrusters!

                                           HELMSMAN
                                     (tries, then)
                             No response, Captain!
    
               5   SPACE - THE PROBE, PAST SARATOGA - ILM                       5

                   The distance closes rapidly; the Probe's size is
                   getting awesome; the GIBBERISH resumes, loud...

                   As the Gibberish reaches a loud climax, the lights go
                   out entirely, along with all engine and electronic
                   sounds. In the sudden darkness:

                                           CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                             Emergency lights!

                   Very low level lights; baffled faces; systems
                   Checking.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Damage report!

                                           SCIENCE OFFICER
                             Captain... All systems have
                             failed... We are functioning on
                             reserve power only.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             We're out of control -- Rig for

                    As it bears down on Saratoga, and passes massively
                    overhead, endlessly; The Probe is now recognized as
                    miles long. It passes now, and goes off into the dis-
                    tance.

               7A   BACK TO THE BRIDGE                                         7A

                                           SCIENCE OFFICER
                                     (stunned)
                             They've finished us. And we don't
                             even know what they want...

                    The Captain considers this, turns to the Comm Officer.

                                           CAPTAIN
                             Give me whatever you've got on the
                             emergency channel.
                                     (then)
                             Starfleet Command, this is Saratoga.
                             Can you hear me...? Come in,
                             please... Come in, please...

                   Disappearing in the distance. The GIBBERISH begins
                   faintly, ominously again.

                   UP now to reveal SAREK, Spock's father, moving OUT OF
                   SHOT.

                   As we PAN Sarek INTO SHOT with COMMANDER CHAPEL,
                   Starfleet Medical Officer whose history in Star Trek is
                   known to all.

                                          CHAPEL
                             Thank you for coming. It's not
                             going well.

                                           SAREK
                             Am I to late to testify?

                                           CHAPEL
                             I don't know.

                    Sarek raises an eyebrow, as they start out.

              11   INT. FEDERATION COUNCIL CHAMBER - ANGLE ON ENTRY            11

                   As Sarek and Chapel enter in semi-darkness, while
                   events are taking place O.S. They look in wonder at:
     
              12   SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                      12

                   As it comes toward us, only to be wrecked and torn
                   apart by a series of explosions.

              13   BACK TO SAREK, CHAPEL                                       13

                   Awed, seeing this for the first time.

                   As Enterprise streaks to its fiery death, watched in
                   LONG SHOT by Kirk and crew. Then as Kirk's face is
                   seen, CLOSE:

                                           KLINGON VOICE
                             There! Hold the image, hold!

                   As Kirk's image FREEZES, PULL BACK to reveal: 

              15   INT. FEDERATION COUNCIL CHAMBER - FULL                      15

                   A doomed room in which the FEDERATION COUNCIL and its
                   PRESIDENT sit at a long table before the Federation
                   Seal. There is a gallery of representatives from vari-
                   ous planets. The screen on which Kirk's image is
                   frozen is centrally located. And at a spot lit glass
                   podium, stands the KLINGON AMBASSADOR, pointing.

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             Behold! The quintessential devil in
                             these matters! James T. Kirk,
                             renegade and terrorist! Not only is
                             he responsible for the murder of a
                             Klingon crew; the theft of a Klingon
                             vessel. See now the real plot and
                             intentions:

              16   VARIOUS ANGLES IN ROOM AND ON SCREEN                        16

                   Kirk, ON SCREEN, introduces the Genesis Device and its
                   awesome visuals (STAR TREK II AND III). Many people in
                   the room have never seen the secret material and react
                   accordingly. And the Klingon continues his tirade

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             Even as the Federation negotiated a
                             peace treaty with us, Kirk was
                             secretly developing the Genesis
                             torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son
                             and test detonated by the Admiral
                             himself!
                                     (the proof is on
                                     screen)
                             The result of this awesome energy
                             was euphemistically called "The
                             Genesis Planet..." A secret base
                             from which to launch the.
                             annihilation of the Klingon people!
                                     (as the audience
                                      stirs)
                             We demand the extradition of Kirk!
                             We demand justice!

                                           SAREK
                             Klingon justice is a unique point of
                             view, Mr. President.

                   As the audience stirs, Sarek descends the stairs.

                                           SAREK
                                     (continuing)
                             Genesis was perfectly named: The
                             creation of life not death. It was
                             the Klingons who had first blood
                             while trying to possess its secrets.

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             Vulcans are well known as the
                             intellectual puppets of the
                             Federation!

                                           SAREK
                                     (evenly)
                             Your vessel did destroy U.S.S.
                             Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's
                             son. Do you deny these events?

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             We deny nothing! We have the right
                             to preserve our race!

                             Do you have the right to murder?

                   The gallery erupts in reaction and the Council
                   President gavels them to silence.

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             Order. There will be no further
                             outbursts from the floor.

                                     (reaches a podium)
                             Mr. President, I have come to speak
                             on behalf of the accused.

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             Personal bias! His son was saved by
                             Kirk!

                   The President remains calm amid the buzzing. Then:

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             Mr. Ambassador, with all respect,
                             the Council's deliberations are
                             over. You have been allowed to
                             speak in order to put your views on
                             the record.

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             Then Kirk goes unpunished?!?

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             Admiral Kirk has been charged with
                             nine violations of Starfleet
                             regulations...

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             Starfleet regulations? Outrageous!
                                     (then)
                             Remember this well: there will be
                             no peace as long as Kirk lives!

                   And with a flourish, he exits with his staff as the
                   assembly murmurs. Then:

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             Sarek of Vulcan, with all respect --
                             we ask you to return Kirk and his
                             crew to answer for their crimes.

                                           SAREK
                             With respect to you, Mr. President,
                             there is only one crime: denying
                             Kirk and his crew the honors they so
                             richly deserve.

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             ... You are welcome to remain and
                             testify.

                   He gavels the meeting to its end. CREDITS CONCLUDE.

                   pad; the crew gathered outside as in a meeting.

                             about the progress of Captain

                             of historical irony, who decided on
                             a name for our captured Klingon
                             vessel.

                             ... And like those mutineers of 500
                             years ago, we too have a hard choice
                             to make. A choice made harder
                             because we are all too old to suffer
                             fools gladly... Nevertheless:

                   CAMERA PANS: as Kirk calls the roll: BONES...
                   SCOTTY... UHURA... CHEKOV... SULU. Each raises a hand
                   and holds it. Kirk now says:

                             Let the record show that the
                             Commander and the crew of the late
                             Starship Enterprise have voted
                             unanimously to return to Earth to
                             face the consequences of their
                             actions in the rescue of their
                             comrade, Captain Spock.
                                     (a long beat)
                             Thank you all... Repair stations,
                             please.

                   As they disperse:

                                           KIRK
                             Mr. Scott, how soon can we get
                             underway?

                                           SCOTTY
                             Give me one more day, sir. The
                             damage control is easy. Reading
                             Klingon is hard.

                   Kirk nods, Scotty heads inside. Bones hangs back sourly.

                                           BONES
                             You'd think they could at least send
                             a ship. Bad enough to be court
                             marshaled and spend the rest of our
                             lives mining borite -- but to come
                             home in this Klingon flea trap...

                                           KIRK
                             We could learn a thing or two from
                             this flea trap. It has a cloaking 
                             device that cost us a lot.

                                           BONES
                             I just wish we could cloak the
                             stench.

                   And he starts off. WIDEN as Kirk turns to LT. SAAVIK,
                   dressed in Vulcan attire.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Admiral, I'd like to continue my
                             work on the ship until you leave.

                                           KIRK
                             Thank you, Lt. Saavik.

                             And... Here is a deposition I have
                             made. If it is not sufficient, I
                             will return to Earth to testify.

                                           KIRK
                             Don't concern yourself, Saavik.
                             Your leave has been granted for good
                             and proper cause.
                                     (a beat)
                             How are you feeling?

                                           SAAVIK
                             I am well, Admiral.

                   They exchange a look, and she starts in, leaving him
                   alone in thought. Then he slowly, almost secretly
                   looks upward: he stares uncertainly at the mountain
                   above.

                   We SLOW ZOOM to the hooded figure. It is SPOCK
                   watching impassively. After a long moment, he turns
                   and leaves.

                   They form a computer console like a great pipe organ,
                   with a bank of keys. On each screen are the words:
                   MEMORY TESTING INTERRUPTED." PULL BACK as Spock
                   enters, sits thoughtfully,. Then he places a small
                   lightweight headset on:

                   What follows happens rapidly: Questions appear on all
                   three screens. The tempo increases through the
                   sequence to a crescendo. Spock takes it all on in stride,
                   answering questions by keyboard, or verbally, without
                   being flapped.

               Q.  What is the molecular formula of Yominum Sulfide
                   crystals?  (A.  K4YM3 (SO73 Es 2)

               Q.  Who said, "Logic is the cement of our civilization
                   with which we ascend from chaos using reason as our
                   guide?"  (A.  T'plana-Hath, matron of Vulcan
                   philosophy.)

               Q.  What significant legal precedent arose from the
                   peace pact between Argus and Rigel IV?  (A.  All beings
                   may not be created equal yet shall be given equal
                   opportunity and treatment under the law.)

               Q.  Solve:  (a graphic of 3-dimensional chess)  (A.  
                   White Queen to section 5, grid 6. Queen takes Knight.
                   Rook takes Queen. White pawn to section 5, grid 7,
                   pawn takes Rook. Checkmate.)

               Q.  What was Kiri-kin-tha's first law of metaphysics?
                   (A.  Nothing unreal exists.)

               Q.  Adjust the sine wave of this magnetic envelope so
                   that anti-neutrons can pass through it but anti-
                   gravitons cannot.  (A.   Spock works keypad and the
                   image of the envelope is changed on one of the
                   screens.)

               Q.  What is the electronic configuration of Gadolinium?
                   (A.   Spock types, in one second: 5s22s22p63d104s24p6
                   4d104f75s25p64d16s2.)

               Q.  Identify: (an image appears)  (A.   A Klingon mum-
                   mification glyph from the earliest part of the
                   Zanxthkolt dynasty.) 

               Q.  What were the principle historical events on the
                   planet Earth in the year 1987?  (A.   Spock types, but
                   things are going too fast for us to see the answer.)

               Q.  What significant contribution to bio-engineering was
                   made on the Loonkerian outpost on Klendth?  (A.   The
                   universal atmospheric element compensator.)

               Q.  What is this a model of?  (A.   A three dimensional
                   theoretical representation of a four dimensional time
                   gate as proposed by the Andorian scientist, Shres.)

               Q.  Where were the first conclusive advances made on
                   toroidal space-time distortion and by whom?  (A.   At
                   Cambridge, Massachusetts, Earth, in 2052 by Ralph
                   Seron.)

               Q.  Evaluate and conclude: A starship's sensors indi-
                   cate it is being pursued so closely that it occupies
                   the same space as its pursuer.  (A.   The warp drive
                   regulators are creating a parallex matter echo.)

                   Abruptly, the hectic pace stops, there is a beat of
                   silence; then, on all three screens comes the legend:
                   MEMORY TEST SATISFACTORY. Then: READY FOR FINAL
                   QUESTION. Spock is ready. HOW DO YOU FEELO? Spock
                   sees it on all three screens and seems baffled. The
                   question begins to flash impatiently.
                                
                                           SPOCK
                             I do not understand.

                   He stares at the flashing question. He becomes aware
                   of someone in the room. He turns to see his mother,
                   AMANDA.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (continuing)
                             I do not understand the final
                             question...

                                           AMANDA
                             You are half human. The Computer
                             knows that.

                                           SPOCK
                             The question is irrelevant.

                                           AMANDA
                             Spock... The retraining of your mind
                             has been in the Vulcan way, so you
                             may not understand feelings. But as
                             my son, you have them. They will
                             surface.

                                           SPOCK
                             As you wish, since you deem them of
                             value. But I cannot wait here to
                             find them.

                                           AMANDA
                             Where must you go?
                                 
                                           SPOCK
                             To Earth. To offer testimony.

                                           AMANDA
                                     (hopefully)
                             You do this -- for friendship?

                                           SPOCK
                             I do this because I was there,

                                           AMANDA
                                     (a pause)
                             Spock. Does the good of the many
                             outweigh the good of the one...?

                                           SPOCK
                             I would accept that as an axiom.

                                           AMANDA
                             Then you stand here alive because of
                             a mistake -- made by your flawed,
                             feeling, human friends. They have
                             sacrificed their futures because they
                             believed that the good of the one --
                             you -- was more important to them.

                                            SPOCK
                                     (a pause)
                             Humans make illogical decisions...

                                         AMANDA
                             ... They do, indeed.
         
                   Spock cocks his head, still baffled by this
                   contradiction.

              23   SPACE - THE PROBE - ILM                                     23

                   It passes CAMERA innocently emitting its CALL. No
                   cause for alarm. Except as the Probe passes into the
                   distance, we see it is headed directly for the blue
                   marble, Earth.

              24   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - 23RD CENTURY - DAY - ILM               24

                   The sun is shining. MOVE, along the Golden Gate
                   Bridge, toward Starfleet Headquarters.

              25   INT. STARFLEET COMMAND - DAY - ILM ELEMENTS                 25

                   Large windows overlook the bay. But in the midsection
                   of the room, hi-tech displays monitor the universe.
                   The scene, and the tension are feverish. One of the
                   communicators is LT. RAND formerly of the Enterprise
                   crew. Commander Chapel is also present. A verbal
                   babble, and visual reports at hectic pace. ADMIRAL
                   MORROW, Starfleet Commander, presides. The Council
                   President enters.

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             Status report, Admiral!

                                           MORROW
                             Mr. President, the Probe has
                             passed through all quadrants. The
                             starships Shepard and Yorktown and
                             three smaller vessels have been
                             neutralized.

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             "Neutralized?" How?

                                           MORROW
                             We don't know. It's using forms of
                             energy our best scientists do not
                             understand...

                                           COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                             Can you protect us?

                                           MORROW
                             We are launching everything we
                             have.

                   As the President reacts to this...

              26   EXT. SPACE DOCK - ILM                                       26

                   The great rotating satellite, home of grand Spaceships.

              27   INT. SPACE DOCK - CONTROL BOOTH, OVERLOOKING SPACE CRAFT    27

                   TWO CONTROLLERS, back to us, sit in the control seats.
                   They control several Starships in b.g.

                                           CONTROLLER ONE
                             Excelsior and Intrepid are cleared
                             to depart. Open space dock doors.

                   Over this, the SOUND OF THE PROBE'S SIGNAL is heard.
                   Almost immediately, Controller Two is in big trouble.

                                           CONTROLLER TWO
                             Sir! Space dock doors are
                             inoperative!

                                           CONTROLLER ONE
                             Keep trying.
                                     (then)
                             Excelsior and Intrepid stand by!
                             Malfunction on exit doors.

                                           INTREPID VOICE
                             Control, Intrepid. Never mind. We
                             can't get powered up!

                   The Two Controllers look at each other as the SOUND OF
                   the Probe's GIBBERISH comes in at DEAFENING VOLUME.

                                           CONTROLLER TWO
                             Space doors not responding. All
                             Emergency systems are non-
                             functional.

                   All over Space dock, lights are dimming.
                   
                                           CONTROLLER ONE

                             Command, this is Space dock on
                             emergency channel. We have lost all
                             internal power. Repeat, we have
                             lost all power!...

                   BERISH comes on, LOUD:

                   An amazing EFFECT: The SOUND, like the prow of an
                   invisible boat, cuts the surface of the ocean, leaving
                   not a wake of water -- but of rising CLOUDS.

                   We INTERCUT between the Probe's transmissions and the
                   impact on the water surfaces of Earth to create a clear
                   impression: CLOUD COVER is slowly forming as ocean
                   water is being transformed into cloud vapor by the
                   SOUND.

                   Our first look in this cavern. In addition to the 
                   transporter and engine areas, there is a large Cargo hold.

                             We're ready, sir. I've converted
                             the Dilithium Sequencer to something
                             less primitive. And Admiral -- I've
                             replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They
                             was givin' me sour stomach.

                             Prepare for departure.

                   As the crew chatters through the pre-launch check list,
                   Kirk crosses to Saavik, near the exit doors, her work
                   finished.

                             Well, Saavik. I guess this is
                             goodbye.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Yes, Admiral.
                                     (then, stiffly)
                             Sir. I have not had the opportunity
                             to tell you about your son.
                                     (then)
                             David died most bravely. He saved
                             Spock. He saved us all... I thought
                             you should know.

                   Kirk wants to know, but is deeply moved. At last he
                   reaches for her shoulders, holds on affectionately.
          
                   After a moment, they separate. We FOLLOW Saavik to the
                   garb, stands in the open doorway looking back at
                   Saavik. A moment. Then:

                                           SAAVIK
                                    (continuing)
                             Good day, Captain Spock... May your
                             journey be free of incident.

                             Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.
        
                   She looks back at Kirk for the briefest moment, then
                   exits. Spock has started forward to Kirk.

                   Spock nods, and somewhat rigidly crosses to the Science
                   station. Kirk watches, uncertain. Bones is suddenly
                   by his side, whispering.

                             isn't exactly working on all

                   It is bedlam. Data is pouring in from every corner of
                   the Earth. All the visuals and audio reports combine
                   to create a trend that is inescapable:

                                           AUDIO  #1
                             Juneau, Alaska, cloud cover
                             increased to 95 percent!

                             is from reserve banks.

                             Leningrad has lost electrical power.

                             Temperatures dropping rapidly.

                   As the reports continue on SCREENS and on SOUND:

                   The SOUND OF THE PROBE is heard throughout, like the
                   death knell. Morrow turns to the President and says
                   privately:

                                           MORROW
                             Mr. President, even with Planetary

                             the sun.

                             I am well aware of that, Admiral.

                   Now the President steps to the great window, where
                   Sarek is watching the world of San Francisco. Rain has
                   begun to streak the window.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Sarek... Is there no answer we can
                             give this Probe?

                                           SAREK
                             It is difficult to answer if you do
                             not understand the question.

                             Mr. President, perhaps you should
                             transmit a planet distress signal,
                             while we still have time.

                    The President looks at Sarek deeply. If his old wise
                    friend has no answer, what hope is there...?

                             before. Can't you tell me what it

                             species exists?

                             The Humpback was indigenous to
                             Earth. Earth of the past.

                                           KIRK
                             That leaves us no choice. We must
                             destroy the probe before it destroys
                             Earth.

                             That would be futile, Admiral. The
                             probe would neutralize us easily.

                                           KIRK
                             But we can't turn away! Is there no
                             alternative?

                                           SPOCK
                             There is one, but I cannot guarantee
                             its success. We could attempt to
                             find some Humpback Whales.

                             You just said there aren't any
                             except on Earth of the past.
                                 
                                           SPOCK
                             That is what I said, Doctor.

                             Then how.?

                   He trails off, seeing Kirk deep in thought.

                             Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a
                             visit.

             52A   INT. CARGO BAY - KIRK AND SCOTTY                           52A

                   striding through a vast Cargo area. Bones follows.

                                           KIRK
                             Scotty, how long is this bay?

                                           SCOTTY
                             About 60 feet, Admiral.

                                           KIRK
                             That should be enough. Can you
                             enclose it to hold water?

                                           SCOTTY
                             I suppose I can, sir; are you
                             planning to take a swim?

                                           BONES
                             Off the deep end, Mr. Scott.

                   As Scotty puzzles -

                                           KIRK
                             Scotty, we have to find some
                             Humpbacks.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (carefully)
                             . Humpbacked - people.?

                                           KIRK
                             Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long;
                             about 40 tons a piece.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Admiral - how am I going to handle
                             all that weight?

                                           KIRK
                             You'll work it out, Scotty. And
                             remember: two of them.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Two?

                                           KIRK
                             It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.

                   And with a confident grin, Kirk exits, pursued by
                   Bones.

                                           SCOTTY
                             The great flood and Noah's Ark.
                             what a way to finally go.

             52B   ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CARGO BAY                              52B

                   As Bones catches up with Kirk.
          
                                           BONES
                             You're really going to try this time
                             travel in this rust bucket?

                                           KIRK
                             We've done it before.

                                           BONES
                             Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If
                             you pick up enough speed you're in
                             time warp. If you don't, you fry..

                                           KIRK
                             Would you prefer to do nothing?

                   And Kirk passes through the Cargo Bay into:

             52C   INT. NECK CORRIDOR - BIRD OF PREY                          52C

                   Bones pursues Kirk on the way to the bridge.

                                           BONES
                             I prefer a dose of common sense.
                             you are proposing to head backwards
                             in time, find Humpback Whales, then
                             bring them forward in time, drop
                             them off - and hope they tell this
                             Probe what to do with itself!

                                           KIRK
                             -- That's the general idea.

                                           BONES
                             That's crazy!

                                           KIRK
                             If you have a better idea - now's
                             the time.

                   There is a pause. Bones does not have a better idea.

             52D   INT. BRIDGE - BIRD OF PREY                                 52D

                   The doors open, Kirk strides in, Bones following.

                                            KIRK

              53   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - ILM                                53

                   Waves crash against the bridge posts and the shoreline.
                   Wind roars: Lightning, thunder, crackle and rumble.

              54   INT. STARFLEET COMMAND                                      54

                   Torrential rain at the window; lightning reflects deep
                   into the room. The situation screens have become
                   erratic; technicians scurry desperately and there is
                   CHATTER overlapping from all. Through this:

                                           COMM OFFICER
                             Sir... I'm picking up a faint 
                             transmission... It's Admiral Kirk
                             calling...!

                                           MORROW
                             On screen!

                   But at this moment, the entire situation display goes
                   fuzzy, distorts, and is gone.
 
                                           MORROW
                                     (continuing)
                             Satellite reserve power, now!

                   The board starts up again, but dimmer, more erratic. A
                   distorted image of Kirk appears on SCREEN (INTERCUT
                   WITH BIRD OF PREY). We will not hear every word.

                                           KIRK'S IMAGE
                             ... Analysis... Probe call...

                             response... Do you read me...?
          
                                           MORROW
                             Stabilize! Emergency reserve!

                   As the Comm Officer responds, Sarek steps up beside
                   Morrow. Now Kirk's image clears enough to see:

                                           KIRK
                             Starfleet, if you read, we are going
                             to attempt time travel. We are
                             computing our trajectory at this
                             time...

                   But suddenly the power fails, Kirk's image is gone. A
                   silence as they stare at the blank screen.

                                           SAREK
                                     (softly)
                             Good luck, Kirk. And all you go
                             with you.

                   The interruption is sudden: the entire great window
                   facing the bay CRASHES INWARD, filling the room with
                   debris, cries, and howling wind.

                             Nuclear power was widely used in
                             naval vessels...

                             careful. This is terra incognita.
                             Many customs will doubtless take us
                             by surprise. It's a forgone
                             conclusion these people have never
                             seen an extra-terrestrial before.

                   Everyone looks at Spock. He arches an eyebrow; reaches
                   into his robe and pulls out a strip of lining which he
                   ties around his head, concealing his ears and making
                   him look like a Japanese gentleman in samurai dress.

                             a phaser and communicator to each

              75   EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - NIGHT                               75

                   A garbage truck is stopped as TWO GARBAGE MEN empty
                   park trash cans into the rear of the truck.

                                           1ST GARBAGE MAN
                             So I told her: if you think I'm
                             laying out sixty bucks for a goddam
                             toaster oven you got another thing
                             coming.

                                           2ND GARBAGE MAN
                             So what'd she say?

                   Before he can answer, a mighty wind comes up. We're
                   talking Hurricane Gloria at 150 m.p.h. It's all they
                   can do to hang on to the truck for dear life, squinting
                   in the direction of the wind. After a couple of moments,
                   the wind dies as quickly as it arose.

                                           1ST GARBAGE MAN
                             What the fuck was that?

                   But both are now taken by a WEIRD SOUND, and they look
                   to see:

              76   EXT. PARK - NIGHT - ILM                                     76

                   The ramp of the Bird of Prey descends, the only visible
                   part of the ship. Kirk and his crew descend, back-lit.

              77   BACK TO THE TRUCK                                           77

                   The garbage men stare in disbelief. Number One starts
                   for the cab, grabs Number Two, who's frozen, and they
                   scramble into the truck, fumble for the starter, and
                   roar away.

                             No. And neither did you, so shut up.

                   As the truck roars off in the distance, Kirk and the
                   crew reach the ground. The ramp closes, restoring
                   normal light.

                   Culture shock! Bustling traffic and people. Our
                   doughty band moves through the scene in awe and wonder,
                   taking in sights and sounds. They are little noticed
                   by passersby; their dress may be a little odd, but this
                   is San Francisco. Now they stop in front of a news
                   machine.

                             out of the 23rd century.

                   A man steps to the machine, inserts coins, takes a
                   paper. Kirk frowns.

                   He looks around in thought, sees:

                             ... Spock --

                   The group spreads out self consciously, as Spock
                   follows Kirk across the street. In mid-street, a car
                   SQUEALS to a stop to avoid hitting Kirk.

                    Spock reacts to this language.

                 84A   EXT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET                      84A

                   The rest of the crew having spread out per Kirk's
                   instructions, are waiting as A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY
                   passes Sulu, does a double take and comes up to him.
                   The scene will be played IN JAPANESE with English
                   sub-titles.

          He starts to back away apologetically but Sulu stops him.

                             sure you want to part with them?

                             How much will you give me?

                   As the Owner examines the glasses:

                                           SPOCK
                             Weren't those a birthday present from
                             Dr. McCoy?

                                           KIRK
                             And they will be again, Spock.
                             That's the beauty of it.
                                    (to Owner)
                             How much?
   
                                           OWNER
                             They'd be worth more if the lenses
                             were intact. I'll give you 200 bucks
                             take it or leave it.

                   As Kirk divides the money.

                             That's all there is, so nobody
                             splurge. Are we set?
                                     (they are)
                             Then, good hunting.

                   And they divide into teams and start off. We stay with
                   Kirk and Spock as they begin walking.

                             Well, Spock, thanks to your restored
                             memory and a little bit of luck, we
                             are in the streets of San
                             Francisco looking for a pair of
                             humpback whales.
                                     (then)
                             How do you propose to solve this
                             minor problem?

                                           SPOCK
                             Simple logic will suffice. We need
                             a map.
                                     (gestures)
                             That one should do.

                   He leads Kirk to a SYSTEM MAP in a bus stop enclosure.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (continuing)
                             I will juxtapose our coordinates on
                             this map and find our destination.

                   He starts to, but the map is diagrammatic, and very
                   puzzling to Spock. As he struggles with its illogic, a
                   BUS pulls up. On the side is an ad: "See GEORGE AND
                   GRACIE, the only two Humpback Whales in Captivity at
                   the Cetacean Institute, Sausalito." Kirk smiles.

                             I think we'll find what we're

                   Kirk, followed by Spock, enters. The door closes, but
                   the bus does not start. CAMERA PANS along bus to the
                   rear exit door, which opens, disgorging a frustrated
                   Kirk and a puzzled Spock.

                   A finger runs down one of the white pages, finds some-
                   thing, snaps the book shut. WIDEN to reveal Chekov

                   Kirk and Spock are riding across the Golden Gate
                   Bridge. In front of them, a punker listens to a ghetto
                   blaster so loudly that every time Kirk tries to talk,
                   he can't be heard. Finally he leans forward and
                   shouts:

                                           KIRK
                             Excuse me. Can you please stop that
                             sound?

                   In response, the punker flips him the finger. In
                   response to which, Spock gives the punker a Vulcan
                   nerve pinch and disarms the radio. Other passengers
                   applaud. Kirk and Spock settle into their seats.

                             As you observed, a primitive

                             Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't

                             Jim... Now what's your question?

                             laced with -- shall I say -- more
                             colorful metaphors: "Double dumb
                             ass on you" -- and so forth...

                             You mean profanity. That's simply
                             the way they talk here.

                             you don't swear every other word.
                             You'll find it in all the literature

                   Kirk thinks.

                   The bus pulls up and disgorges Kirk, Spock and a few

                   Large, beautiful, with great hanging replicas of whales
                   dominating. A tour group has gathered, and DR. GILLIAN
                   TAYLOR, perkily attractive , enters to take charge.

                                           GILLIAN
                             Good morning. I'm your guide this
                             morning; my name's Dr. Gillian
                             Taylor, but you can call me Gillian.
                             I'm Assistant Director of the
                             Maritime Cetacean Institute. Please
                             follow me and just give a yell if
                             you can't hear, okay?

                   She starts off, all follow.
                                      
                                           GILLIAN
                                     (continuing)
                             The Cetacean Institute is the only
                             museum in the world exclusively
                             devoted to whales. As you can see
                             we have a great seal to offer, but
                             that is small compared to what we
                             know -- or rather what wee don't know
                             about whales. The first commonly
                             held misconception is that whales
                             are fish.
                             They're not; they're mammals like
                             us. Warm-blooded, needing air to
                             breathe and producing milk to nurse
                             their young. They are very old
                             mammals -- 11 million years, give
                             or take.

                    During the spiel, Taylor notices Kirk. In an odd way,
                    they connect. He's attractive, even in his odd clothes,
                    and he pays stricter attention than the average Joe.

                                           A MAN
                             Do whales attack people -- like in
                             "Moby Dick"?

                                           GILLIAN
                             Most whales don't even have teeth.
                             They strain vast amounts of tiny
                             shrimp for food and that is the
                             limit of their hostility. Un-
                             fortunately, their principle enemy
                             is far more aggressive.

                                           KIRK
                             You mean man...

                                           GILLIAN
                             To put it mildly. Since the dawn of
                             time, men have harvested whales for
                             a variety of purposes, most of which
                             can be achieved synthetically at this
                             point. A hundred years ago, using
                             hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty
                             of damage -- but that was nothing
                             compared to what they've achieved
                             in this century.

                   Gillian pushes a button and screens modern whale-hunt
                   footage. Pretty gruesome stuff.

                                     (continuing; still
                                      emotional for her)
                             This is mankind's legacy: whales
                             hunted to the brink of extinction.
                             Virtually gone is the Blue Whale,
                             largest creature ever to inhabit
                             the Earth.
                                     (beat)
                             Despite all attempts at banning
                             whaling, there are still countries
                             and pirates currently engaged in
                             slaughter of these inoffensive
                             creatures. Where the humpback whale
                             once numbered in the hundreds of
                             thousands, today there are less than
                             7 thousand specimens alive and those
                             that are taken are no longer fully
                             grown. In addition, many of the
                             females are killed, still bearing
                             unborn calves.

                   The pictures graphically illustrate what she's talking
                   about.

                             To hunt a species to extinction is
                             not logical.

                             logical?

                             Now if you'll follow me, I'll
                             introduce you to the Institute's
                             pride and joy.

                   They start after her.

              93   EXT. WHALE TANK - DAY - ILM ELEMENTS                        93

                                           GILLIAN
                             This is the largest sea water tank
                             in the world -- and it contains the
                             only two humpback whales in
                             captivity.

                  The two whales undulate majestically. They are
                  colossal. Kirk and Spock react in awe.

                                           GILLIAN
                                     (continuing)
                             They are mature humpbacks, weighing
                             45,000 pounds each. They wandered
                             into San Francisco Bay as calves and
                             were brought here. We call them
                             George and Gracie.

                                           KIRK
                                     (excited whisper)
                             It's perfect, Spock: a male, a
                             female, together in a contained
                             space can beam them up together
                             and consider ourselves damn lucky...

                   Spock reacts oddly to this.

                                           GILLIAN
                             Beautiful, aren't they? And
                             extremely intelligent. Why
                             shouldn't they be? They're swimming
                             around with the largest brains on
                             Earth... Now if you'll follow me
                             please.

                   The group enters the building. Spock hangs back. Kirk
                   does not notice his absence.

                   As Gillian continues the tour.

                                           GILLIAN
                             Despite all the things they are
                             teaching us we have to return
                             George and Gracie to the open sea.

                                           KIRK
                             Why's that?

                                           GILLIAN
                             Well, for one thing, we simply don't
                             have the money to keep feeding them
                             a couple of tons of shrimp a day!

                                           KIRK
                             How soon?

                                           GILLIAN
                             Soon... It's too bad because they're
                             very friendly as you can see. I've
                             grown quite attached to them... This
                             way.

                   She starts down a spiral staircase that winds around
                   the tank. The others follow, minus Spock.

                   Gillian stops with her back to the tank.

                                           GILLIAN
                             Here's a much better way to see
                             George and Gracie -- underwater.

                   Kirk has begun to look for Spock -- but in vain.

              95   INT. TANK - UNDERWATER                                      95

                   As Gillian continues her spiel, CAMERA MOVES IN toward
                   the whales and discovers Spock -- in the water, swimming
                   to them! He approaches one, and looks it in the eye.
                   The great eye stares back.

              96   CLOSER ANGLE - UNDERWATER                                   96

                   Spock and the whale are a foot apart. Spock gently
                   puts his hand on the whale -- a MIND MELD. A shaft of
                   back lightning makes the mood ethereal.

              97   EXT. TANK                                                   97

                   Over speakers, we hear WHALE SONG. The crowd reacts.

                                           GILLIAN
                             What you're hearing is whale song. It
                             is sung by the male. He'll sing any-
                             where from six to as long as thirty
                             minutes, and then, start again. In
                             the ocean, other whales will pick up
                             the song... And pass it on.

                   Now Kirk sees Spock in the water behind Gillian and is
                   in mild shock. He watches wild-eyed as Spock and whale
                   move through the water in mid mind-meld.

                                           GILLIAN
                                     (continuing)
                             The songs change every year, but
                             we still don't know what purpose
                             they serve. Are they navigational?
                             Part of the mating ritual? Or pure
                             communication beyond our comprehension?

                                           AN OLDER WOMAN
                             Maybe he's singing to the man.

                   As the woman points, Gillian turns around to see:

                             Excuse me! Wait right here!

                   She dashes up the stairs as Kirk desperately pursues.

                   Spock climbs out, and is putting on his robe as Gillian
                   comes running to him from a distance, followed but
                   Kirk.

                             you doing in there?!

                   Spock turns to Kirk for guidance, but:

                   Spock gives it his best logical shot.

                   Spock hesitates.

                   Gillian sits on the edge, dangling her feet. George
                   and Gracie swim back and forth next to her, blowing
                   water that showers her. She strokes them.

                                           GILLIAN
                             It's all right. Yes. I know. It's 
                             okay. They didn't mean any harm.

                   The whales make NOISES. They are trying to tell her
                   something -- but what? BOB BRIGGS, Director of the
                   Institute, comes up behind her.

                                           BOB
                             Heard there was some excitement.

                                           GILLIAN
                             Just a couple of kooks...           

                   Bob watches her affectionately from behind; kicks off
                   his shoes and, rolling up his slacks, sits down next to
                   her with his feet in the water.

                                           BOB
                             How're you doing? 

                                           GILLIAN
                             Fine. Just fine.

                                           BOB
                             Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo.
                             I've known you too long.

                                           GILLIAN
                             Bob... it's tearing me apart.

                                           BOB
                             I know. I feel the same thing. But
                             we're between a rock and a hard
                             place. We can't keep them without
                             risking their lives and we can't let
                             them go without a taking the same
                             chance.

                             And finally, they're not human
                             beings, you know. Their
                             intelligence has in no way been
                             proven comparable to ours --

                                           GILLIAN
                             I don't know about you, but my
                             compassion for someone is not
                             limited to my estimate of their 
                             intelligence.

                             the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt    
                             bike but they didn't ravish the land  
                             either.                               

                   Bob is rebuked. Gillian rises.        

                                           GILLIAN
                                     (continuing)
                             Sorry if I spoke out of turn.

                                           BOB
                             Not at all. You gave me things to
                             think about. You always do. You do
                             sound a little wrecked, why don't     
                             you go home and stare at the          
                             ceiling?

                             Why don't I?

                   Gillian goes off. Bob sits, then takes his feet out of
                   the tank. JOE, an assistant, comes over.

                                           JOE
                             We all squared away?

                             Looks like it.

                                           JOE
                             She's gonna go berserk.

                                           BOB
                             It's for her own good, Joe; it's the
                             only way. She'll call me names for
                             a while, but then she'll calm down
                             and understand.

                   banners and the dockside cabanas that this is "U.S.S.
                   ENTERPRISE, CVN65." A definite Star Trek moment.

                   A moment between them. Then Uhura whips out her
                   tricorder and begins getting some readings. As the 
                   tricorder BEEPS, Chekov pulls out the communicator.

                   slowly enough so that they look up to see her. As she
                   leaves them behind, she purses her lips, stops the car,
                   considers. Then she backs up.

                   The Land rover backs into the scene; Kirk acknowledges
                   her presence but continues walking, playing it cool.
                   Gillian begins tracking alongside.

                                     (inspiration)
                             Back in the sixties he was part of 
                             the Free Speech movement at
                             Berkeley. I think he did too much
                             LDS.

                             LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of
                             everything else? Come on, Lemme
                             give you a lift. I have a notorious
                             weakness for hard luck cases --
                             that's why I work with whales.

                             You've already been that. C'mon.

                   She stops, pushes open the door. They get in, Spock in
                   the middle staring straight ahead.

                             Thanks.

                             Don't mention it. And don't try
                             anything, either. I got a tire iron
                             right where I can get at it.

                   Kirk has no idea what she's talking about. Silence.
                   Then, to Spock:

                             So you were at Berkeley.

                             I was not.

                   Kirk rolls his eyes.

                             hell were you boys really trying to
                             do back there? Was it some kinda 
                             macho thing? If that's all, I'm
                             gonna be real disappointed. I hate
                             that macho type.

                             Can I ask you something?

                             release the whales?

                   Long pause. Gillian doesn't like considering this.

                                           GILLIAN
                             They're gonna hafta take their
                             chances.

                                           KIRK
                             What does that mean, exactly? Take
                             their chances.

                                           GILLIAN
                             It means that they will be at risk
                             from whale hunters -- same as the
                             rest of the humpbacks.
                                    (to Spock)
                             What did you mean when you said all
                             that stuff back at the Institute
                             about extinction?

                             I meant --

                                           KIRK
                             He meant what you were saying on the 
                             tour: that if things keep on the
                             way they're going, humpbacks will
                             disappear forever.

                                           GILLIAN
                             That's not what he said, farm boy.
                             "Admiral, if we were to assume these
                             whales are ours to do with as we
                             please, we would be as guilty as
                             those who caused -- past tense --
                             their extinction."

                   A silence.

                             colorful metaphor?

                                           GILLIAN

                             teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, 
                             or some dipshit stuff like that?

                             Well, that's something. I'da let
                             you off right here.

                             All right. Who are you? and don't
                             jerk me around any more. I want to
                             know how you know that.

                             Please, just -- let me finish. I
                             can tell you that we're not in the

                             to the whales.

                             In fact, we may be able to help --
                             in ways that, frankly, you couldn't
                             possibly imagine.

                             Or believe, I'll bet.

                             Very likely. You're not exactly
                             catching us at our best.

                                           SPOCK
                             That much is certain.

                   Silence.

                             You know I've got a hunch we'd all
                             be a lot happier talking over
                             dinner. What do you say?

                   Gillian considers this for a moment; she's got nothing
                   better to do. Finally:

                                           GILLIAN
                             You guys like Italian food?

                   Kirk and Spock exchange glances, mystified.

                              KIRK      (overlapping)      SPOCK
                              Yes.                          No.

                   Scotty, dressed conservatively, paces back and forth.
                   After a moment, the manager, NICHOLS, emerges with
                   Bones.

                                           NICHOLS
                             Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, 
                             plant manager. I'm terribly sorry
                             but there's been an awful mix-up
                             Would you believe I was never told
                             about your visit?

                             I tried to clear things up, 
                             Professor Scott. I explained you'd
                             come all the way from Edinburgh on
                             appointment to study manufacturing
                             methods here at Plexico, but they
                             don't seem to know anything about 
                             it.

                             Don't know anything about it? I 
                             find it difficult to believe that
                             I've come millions of miles --

                                           NICHOLS
                             Millions?

                             Thousands; the Professor's
                             understandably upset --

                             Thousands of miles on an invited
                             tour of inspection, only to be
                             informed that I was never invited in
                             the first place!

                                           NICHOLS
                             Professor Scott, if you'll --
        
                                           SCOTTY
                             I demand to see the owners! I 
                             demand --

                                           BONES
                             Professor, just take it easy! Dr.
                             Nichols is offering to take us
                             around personally.

                                           SCOTTY
                                    (chagrined)
                             He is?

                                           NICHOLS
                             With pleasure.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Well, that's different.

                                           NICHOLS
                             If you'll follow me, Professor --

                                           SCOTTY
                             I will. Can my assistant come, too?

                                           NICHOLS
                             Of course.

                   Scotty starts past Bones.

                   Products of all shapes and sizes are stacked. In the
                   midst of this, sits a great HUEY helicopter with the
                   company logo on its side. Its PILOT is working on his
                   engine as Sulu comes up touches the craft lovingly,
                   stares studiously into the cockpit.

                                           PILOT
                             Hi.

                                           SULU
                             Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?                  

                                           PILOT
                             Right on. You fly?

                                           SULU
                             Oh, here and there.
                                     (pats it)
                             I flew something similar in my
                             Academy days.

                                           PILOT
                             All right, then this is old stuff to
                             you. 

                                           SULU
                             Old, yes. But interesting.
                                     (then)
                             Do you mind if I ask a few
                             questions...?

             113   INT. NICHOL'S CUBICLE - DAY                                113

                   An impressive glass-walled cubicle separating the boss
                   from the factory chaos. Nichols leads Scotty and Bones
                   inside.

                                           NICHOLS
                             Well, so much for the tour of our
                             humble plant. I must say,
                             Professor your knowledge of 
                             engineering is most impressive.

                                           BONES
                             Back home, we call him the miracle
                             worker.

                                           NICHOLS
                             Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen
                             anything?

                   A look between Bones and Scotty. Then:

                                           SCOTTY
                             Doctor Nichols, I might have
                             something to offer you.

                                           NICHOLS
                             ... Yes?

                                           SCOTTY
                             I notice you're still working with
                             polymers.

                                           NICHOLS
                                     (mystified)
                             Sill? What else would I be working
                             with?

                                           SCOTTY
                             Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it
                             another way: how thick would a piece
                             of your plexiglass need to be at 60
                             feet by 10 feet to withstand the
                             pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of 
                             water?

                                           NICHOLS
                             That's easy: 6 inches. We carry
                             stuff that big in stock.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just
                             suppose -- I could show you a way to
                             manufacture a wall that would do the
                             same job but was only an inch thick.
                             would that be worth something to
                             you, eh?

                                           NICHOLS
                             ... Are you joking?

                                           BONES
                             He never jokes... Perhaps the
                             professor could use your computer.

                                           NICHOLS
                             Please...

                   He gestures, and Scotty sits at a nearby Macintosh. He
                   surveys the machine quizzically, clears his throat, and
                   in a loud voice says:

                                           SCOTTY
                             Computer --

                   Bones steps in quickly, picks up the "Mouse" and shoves 
                   it into Scotty's hand. Scotty looks at the mouse,
                   baffled, then puts it to his lips like a mike.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (continuing)
                             Hello? Computer...?

                                           NICHOLS
                                     (bewildered)
                             Just use the keyboard...

                                           SCOTTY
                             The keyboard... How quaint.

                   Then, preparing his fingers like a concert pianist, he
                   plunges to work furiously.

                   An awesome series of figures and graphics are
                   appearing. PULL BACK to reveal Scotty, now master of
                   the keyboard, while Nichols watches in awe, next to
                   Bones. with a flourish, Scotty hits a last command,
                   and a wondrous three dimensional graphic appears.

                                           NICHOLS
                                     (wide-eyed)
                             Transparent aluminum?

                                           SCOTTY
                             That's the ticket, laddie.

                                           NICHOLS
                             ... But it would take years just to
                             figure out the dynamics of this
                             matrix...!

                                           BONES
                             You'll be rich beyond the dreams of
                             avarice.

                                           SCOTTY
                             So, is it worth something? Or
                             should I just punch "clear"...

                                           NICHOLS
                             No!
                                     (then)
                             No... What did you have in mind...?

                                           BONES
                             A moment alone, please.

                                           BONES
                                     (continuing)
                             You know, if we give him the 
                             formula, we'll be altering the
                             future.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Why? how do you know he didn't
                             invent the thing!

                   As Bones accepts the truth of this, we hear:

                                           KIRK'S VOICE
                             Right here is fine.

             115   EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - SPACESHIP SITE - DUSK              115
                   The Land rover pulls to a stop. Kirk and Spock get out,
                   but Kirk gets back in.
      
             116   CLOSER - ACROSS GILLIAN IN CAR                             116

                   Spock is now outside. Gillian calls to him:  

                                           GILLIAN
                             You sure you won't change your mind?

                                           SPOCK
                             Is there something wrong with the
                             one I have?

                             Just a little joke. See you later, 
                             old friend.

                                           GILLIAN
                                     (still to Spock)
                             How did you know Gracie's pregnant?
                             Nobody knows that.

                                           SPOCK
                             Gracie does.
                                     (to Kirk)
                             I'll be right here.

                   Spock walks OUT OF VIEW.

                                           GILLIAN
                             He's just going to hang around the
                             bushes while we eat?

                             It's his way.

                   And they drive off.

                   After the Land rover has departed, he is left alone,
                   standing quietly. Then, with no warning, he BEAMS OUT.

             118   INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - KIRK AND GILLIAN - NIGHT         118

                   Not fancy but nice; a WAITER stands, ready to take
                   their order.
    
                                           GILLIAN
                             Do you trust me?

                             Good.
                                     (to Waiter)
                             A large mushroom and pepperoni with
                             extra onions. And a Michelob. 

                                           WAITER
                             And you, sir?

                   Kirk stares at the menu blankly. He shrugs.

                                           KIRK
                             Make it two.

                   The Waiter leaves. Kirk and Gillian, a moment; then:

                             So how did a nice girl like you get
                             to be a cetacean biologist?

                             Just lucky, I guess.

                             You're upset about losing the
                             whales.

                                           GILLIAN
                             ... You're very perceptive.

                             How will that be done, exactly?

                                           GILLIAN
                             They'll be flown in a special 747 to
                             Alaska and released there.

                                           KIRK
                             Flown... And that's the last you'll
                             see of them?

                                           GILLIAN
                             See, yes. But we'll tag them with

                             You know, I could take those whales
                             somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.

                             If you have such a low opinion of my
                             abilities, how come we're having
                             dinner?

                             I told you: I'm a sucker for hard
                             luck cases. Besides, I want to know
                             why you travel around with that
                             ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is
                             pregnant and calls you Admiral.
 
                   Kirk says nothing, looks at her. There's chemistry,
                   all right.

                             right now.

                             Let's just say that no humpback born
                             in captivity has ever survived.
                                     (a sigh)
                             Problem is, they won't be a whole
                             lot safer at sea because of all the
                             hunting this time of year... So
                             that, as they say, is that.
                                     (her eyes begin
                                      to moisten)
                             Damn.

                   As she dabs her eyes with a napkin, Kirk's communicator 
                   BEEPS three times from under his clothes. Pained, he
                   ignores it.

                   The BEEPER again. Exasperated, Kirk flips it open.

                   Long pause. Gillian stares at him, pulls on her beer

                   The Waiter arrives, plunks the pizza down and holds up
                   the check.

                   And so saying, he exits, leaving a baffled Gillian and 
                   Waiter. Gillian, a beat, then covers to the Waiter:

                   A SAILOR in dungarees and a DRUG DOG patrol the empty         
                   corridor. As they near CAMERA a familiar SOUND (THE
                   BEAM-IN) is heard faintly. The dog stops, his ears go
                   up in surprise. The sailor has not heard the sound.
                   He whistles to the dog and urges him on down the

                   have made it in. They carry with them the COLLECTING

                   metal piece. They start forward, hide momentarily as a 
                   PAIR OF FEET walk above them, seen through the metal
                   decking which forms a ceiling above them. Then they

                   area marked by sings, warnings, and flashing red
                   lights. Uhura takes a confirming reading on her
                   tricorder, nods, and Chekov fans the metal piece open
                   into a parabolic shape. He places the "dish" in the 
                   place indicated by Uhura, turns on a power source. A
                   FAINT SOUND indicates it is working.

                             are... You wouldn't want to show me
                             around your space ship, would you?

                             to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd 
                             Century. If I have to, I'll go to
                             the open sea to get them, but I'd
                             just as soon take yours -- better
                             for me, better for you... and better
                             for them.

                   He gives her a brief kiss and is gone. She sits there,
                   surprised, but not disagreeably. Then she RESTARTS her
                   CAR and is about to depart when she hears an ODD SOUND
                   O.S. and there is a SLIGHT FLICKER of reflected LIGHT.
                   She turns and looks back through the rear window.

                   last stood.

                   She turns back, puzzled; slips the car into gear, and
                   still puzzled, departs.

                   Enraged and frustrated, Kirk stalks off, leaving

                   anger, pain, and above all, confusion.

                   at Chekov in concern. He can only shrug.

                             you're doing here and what this

                             top.

                             I do not know your name.

                                           FBI AGENT

                   The Agent takes a deep breath of exasperation and,
                   leaving Chekov at the table, walks back to the
                   Civilian.

                                           FBI AGENT
                             What do you think?

                             He's a Russkie.

                                           FBI AGENT
                             No kidding... He may be a russkie, 
                             all right, but he's a retard or
                             something.

                             We better call Washington...

                   While they huddle, Chekov snatches up the phaser.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Don't move.

                   They stare at him in disbelief.

                                           FBI AGENT
                             Okay... Make nice and give us the
                             ray gun.

                             I varn you. If you don't lie on the
                             floor, I vill have to stun you.

                                     (patiently)
                             Go ahead. Stun me.

                                           CHEKOV
                             I'm wery sorry, but --

                   He aims the phaser and pulls. It makes a pathetic
                   BURBLING SOUND. Everyone stares. Chekov, 
                   apologetically:

                                           CHEKOV
                                     (continuing)
                             It must be the radiation...

                   With an abrupt change of mood he bolts for the nearest
                   bulkhead door, dogs it open and reaches out.

                                           FBI AGENT
                                     (wearily)
                             Someone sound a general alarm.
                             better tell the Marines to go easy,
                             don't hurt the crazy bastard.

                   A140  -- As ALARMS SOUND, Chekov dogs a bulkhead door behind
                            him, then as a choice of down a hatch or up a
                            ladder.  He wisely goes up.

                   B140  -- Marines pour from hatchways and corridors in hot
                            pursuit.

                   C140  -- Chekov up a ladder, Marines in pursuit below. 
    
                         -- Up the ladders come the Marines.

                   D140  -- HANGAR DECK: Chekov breaks into the great empty
                            space, barn like; he see's the elevator opening and
                            a shot at freedom, he races toward the light.

                   E140  -- Marines, gaining, follow him across the hangar deck.

                   F140  -- Chekov reaches the elevator portal, races onto the
                            elevator and the gangway beyond -- only to see:

                   G140  -- SHORE PATROLMEN, coming up the gangplank to the
                            elevator.

                   H140  -- Behind Chekov, the Marines have caught up. He veers
                            to his left, thinking to dive into the water, trips
                            and, with a cry:

            140A   EXT. SHIP - UP ANGLED - NIGHT                             140A

                   It's too late for Chekov. He falls from the elevator
                   into CAMERA --

            140B   REVERSE - TOWARD BARGE                                    149B

                   Chekov has landed on a floating barge below 
                   the elevator. He lies there, unmoving.

                   enters, comes to her.

                   Kirk steps to his chair, presses COMM, weary,

                   HOLD on Spock. Up above, HOLD on Kirk, as Uhura's 
                   police calls ECHO faintly in b.g., he feels all the

                   It's very quiet. No press. No crews. The main door

                   scream is silent because its drowned out by the SOUND OF 
                   THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. Gillian looks up to see:

             152   THE HELICOPTER                                             152

                   It comes closer, then hovers.

                   He climbs into SHOT from below FRAME LINE, waves Sulu
                   in like a landing officer on a carrier.

                   The chopper is lowering the plexiglass into thin air,
                   and guiding the process is half of Scotty, visible only
                   from the waist up.

                   Gillian, stunned, moves forward to get a better view,
                   and clunks her head on an invisible strut. She gets up
                   and feels the thing like a blind person. She's
                   starting to understand she's in some Twilight Zone. In
                   desperation:

                                           GILLIAN
                             Kirk! Kirk! Listen to me! Oh,

                   He's seen her distress below him. To communicator:

                   He is looking upward, a shaft of daylight falling on
                   his face. As he hears Scotty's cry from above, he
                   turns quickly to a SURVEILLANCE MONITOR close by.
                   There on the screen he sees Gillian's agitated
                   figure. There is a moment of amazed reaction then
                   looking back up to Scotty:

                                           KIRK

                   of the invisible ship.

                             Kirk!! Please, Kirk!!

                   The SOUND she once heard, she hears again; and to her
                   disbelief, she disappears in the BEAM EFFECT.

                             talked about was image therapy.

                                           BONES
                             Unbelievable.

                                           1ST INTERN
                             You have a different view, Doctor?

                                           BONES
                             Sounds like the goddam Spanish
                             Inquisition...

                   The doors open. They wheel the bed out, the doors
                   close, leaving the Interns looking at each other,
                   perplexed.

             166   INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY                               166

                   We TRACK behind Kirk, Bones and the bed towards the end
                   of the hall. TWO POLICEMEN block their passage.

                                           BONES
                             Out of the way!

                   They don't budge. Under the sheet, Gillian starts to
                   wail.

                                           POLICEMAN
                             Sorry, doctor! we have strict
                             orders...

                   Gillian wails louder. The Policemen look uncertain.

                                           BONES
                             Dammit, this woman has immediate
                             post prandial upper abdominal
                             distension! Do you want an acute
                             case on your hands?

                   Gillian wails. The Policemen finally move aside and
                   they push their way through.

             167   ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF DOORS                                167

                             What did you say she was getting?

                             Cramps.

                   Gillian sits up, throws off the sheet as they see the
                   operating theatre. They leave the bed where it is and
                   proceed into the room, lifting their surgical masks.

                                           DOCTOR (O.S.)
                             Lee, why hasn't this man been
                             prepped?

                   Kirk looks to Bones, who nods and they walk around the
                   curtain where Chekov, unconscious, lies on the table.
                   Two nurses arrange instruments in preparation for
                   surgery, while a YOUNG DOCTOR reads Chekov's chart.

                                           DOCTOR
                                     (looks up)
                             Who are you? Doctor Adams was
                             supposed to assist me.

                                           BONES
                             We're just -- observing.

                             I was not informed about observers.

                   Then, to the curious glances of the surgical team,
                   Bones takes out his Tricorder and passes it over to
                   Chekov --

                                           DOCTOR

                             Fundoscopic examination is
                             unrevealing in these cases!

                                           DOCTOR
                                     (condescendingly)

                             epidural hematoma will relieve the

                             My God, man, drilling holes in his
                             head is not the answer. The artery
                             must be repaired without delay or he
                             will die! So put away your butcher
                             knives and let me save the patient!

                   The young Doctor gives Bones an icy stare.

                                           DOCTOR
                             I don't know who the hell you are,
                             but I'm going to have you removed.

                   But as he turns to leave, Kirk blocks his path, then --

                             Doctors, doctors, this is highly

                   He gives the Doctor a swift, sure, Judo chop. Gillian
                   and the nurses gasp.

                   As Bones pulls out his Medical Tricorder and begins
                   working on Chekov, Kirk slings the fallen Doctor over
                   his shoulder, and draws a phaser.

                   Indicating a windowed room adjoining, he herds them in
                   there, lowers the Doctor to the floor, and closes the
                   door. Then he adjusts his phaser, aims at the lock and:

                         all disappear up the ramp, which now begins to close.

                      -- Kirk alone with Gillian. She sees the ramp closing
                         and begins to sense something wrong.

                   The Whaler is modern, and plows through the water at 25
                   knots. Its crew are largely bearded; they are Northern
                   Europeans, maybe Swedes, Icelanders or Russians, all
                   famous as Humpback hunters. The radar turns lazily.
                   Then:

                   In the crow's nest a sailor points. Binoculars are
                   trained. They see something! The ship begins a
                   gradual course change. The engine telegraph signals
                   FLANK SPEED. The decks are exploding with activity as
                   she heads toward the quarry.

                             ... I don't think he understands...

                                           BONES
                             No, Spock. It means he feels safer
                             about your "guesses" than most other
                             peoples facts.

                   There is a pause.

                                           SPOCK
                             You're saying... It is a compliment.

                                           BONES
                             It is.

                   Spock straightens, pulls the bottom of his garment
                   straight with dignity, and accepts the responsibility.

                                           SPOCK
                             I will try to make the best guess I
                             can.

             225   INT. CARGO BAY - WHALES IN TANK - ILM ELEMENTS             225

                   The two whales are contentedly behind the plexiglass,
                   their eyes focusing on Gillian. Kirk, Scotty flank
                   her, all watching the whales.

                   Scotty exits shot.

                                           GILLIAN

                   As she looks at Kirk, the ship begins to vibrate
                   quietly.

                                           SCOTTY
                             You better get up there, sir. We're

                   Kirk enters through the WHOOSHING DOORS. The bridge is
                   beginning to shake badly now. Kirk listens to:
                                 
                                           SCOTTY'S VOICE

                   Kirk steps forward.

                                           SPOCK

                             guarantee we will escape the Sun's
                             gravity! I will attempt to
                             compensate by altering our trajectory.

                   CLOSE on Spock as the buffeting gets intense. A wait.
                   A further wait. Then:

                                           SPOCK
                             Steady... Steady... Now.

             228   SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS - "THE SLINGSHOT" - ILM            228

                   -- Just as the Bird appears certain to be swallowed by
                      the Sun, a BLAST accelerates the ship along the far
                      curve of the Sun as before. Solar flares lick the
                      blurring vessel as she disappears behind the Sun. The
                      CAMERA PANS ACROSS the Sun, waiting for the "comet" to
                      appear around the far side of the Sun as she did
                      before... And we wait. And we wait.

                   -- CLOSER. The bird does not appear. The wait is
                      interminable. Has the ship incinerated...? Then
                      abruptly: there is a BANG and the SOUND OF RETROS as
                      we heard in the first time sequence. Suddenly:

             229   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE                                 229

                   The SILENCE is total and deafening. We do not hear
                   even the ambient pings and pongs of the electronic
                   equipment. We have a feeling of LIMBO. Yet the people
                   seem all right, though baffled. Are we in some new
                   dimension? Kirk surveys the scene, and dares to speak:

                             Then... Where the hell are we?

                   Consternation from all; then, FAINTLY in the void of
                   sound, we begin to hear the PROBE GIBBERISH...

                   WAVES CRASH against the shore. This sequence is
                   exactly as we saw earlier in the film. GIBBERISH
                   louder now.

                             Sir... I'm picking up a faint
                             transmission... It's Admiral Kirk
                             calling...!

                                           MORROW
                             On screen!

                   But at this moment, the entire situation display goes
                   fuzzy, distorts, and is gone.

                                           MORROW
                                     (continuing)
                             Satellite reserve power, now!

                   The board starts up again, but dimmer, more erratic. A
                   distorted image of Kirk appears on SCREEN (INTERCUT
                   WITH BIRD OF PREY). We will not hear every word.

                                           KIRK'S IMAGE
                             ... Analysis... Probe call...

                             Stabilize! Emergency reserve!

                   As the Comm Officer responds, Sarek steps up beside
                   Morrow. Now Kirk's image clears enough to see:

                                           KIRK
                             Starfleet, if you read, we are going
                             to attempt time travel. We are
                             computing our trajectory at this
                             time...

                   But suddenly the power fails, Kirk's image is gone. A
                   silence as they stare at the blank screen.

                                           SAREK

                             with you.

                   The interruption is sudden: the entire great window
                   facing the bay CRASHES INWARD, filling the room with
                   debris, cries, and howling wind. (END REPEAT SEQUENCE.)

             232   INT. STARFLEET COMMAND - NEW FOOTAGE                       232

                   As the wind and the rain blow through the room, we find
                   Sarek and Morrow, hands held up to protect their faces,
                   then, suddenly, Sarek looks outward -- point"

                   Deep overcast, lightning flashes, heavy rain. We are
                   looking toward the Golden Gate. The BIRD OF PREY is
                   descending out of the overcast headed toward the bridge
                   in a shallow, but uncontrolled dive. PROBE GIBBERISH
                   present through out sequence.

                   The buffeting of turbulence; the GIBBERISH loud. A
                   sense of helplessness we've never seen from this crew.

                   -- The crew holds its breath and --

                   -- The Bird of Prey SLAMS into the water like a giant
                      stone being skipped, bounces once, then bellies in

                      it is clear she is sinking.

                   Water sprays from seams and pipes; the crew struggles
                   to move against the uphill tilt.

                   Spock does. Kirk struggles to the blown out hatch
                   near Spock. He looks up into the rain above:

                   Rain, fog, but above all: the GIBBERISH of the Probe.

                             Spock. Now all we have to do is get
                             the whales out before we sink.

                             I will, Admiral.

                   Stay with Kirk as he fights his way downhill to the
                   exit doors, which he forces open with great effort,
                   then exits.

             241   FLOODED CARGO BAY - ASLANT - SCOTTY AND GILLIAN            241

                   They're in trouble. The water is waist deep and
                   rising. Scotty cannot open the hatch door to the NECK.

                   Kirk, water spraying about him, reaching the cargo bay
                   door. He tugs at the emergency release. It's stuck.

             243   FLOODED CARGO BAY - (INTERCUT)                             243

                   Water is now up to their necks. Scotty and Gillian
                   can't get out unless --

                   -- Kirk now wrenches the release, pulls the door
                      open. He reaches his hand down, helps Gillian, then
                      Scotty, into the temporary safety of the corridor
                      above. Above the DIN OF WIND, RAIN and HISSING WATER,
                      Kirk shouts:

                   But Kirk takes a deep breath and is gone, diving below.
                   Scotty watches helplessly, then turns to aid Gillian up
                   and out, closing the hatch as ordered.

                   As Kirk swims in, begins searching. It's not going to
                   be easy: Kirk cannot hold his breath forever.

             245   EXT. OCEAN - DAY - (INTERCUT)                              245

                   As the crew, one by one, emerge from the bridge window
                   into the pelting rain. They cling to the floating
                   bridge.

                   Inside the bridge, Spock helps Scotty and Gillian in
                   and to the window exit.

                   Kirk breaks the surface, his lungs screaming for air.
                   Only a few inches remain unflooded. He gulps air, and
                   dives one last time.

             247   INT. CARGO BAY - UNDERWATER - SERIES OF SHOTS              247

                   A determined Kirk swims rapidly down, looks desperately,
                   finally finds the panel behind a layer of wreckage. He
                   rips the barrier away, opens the seal, presses the
                   sensor. There is a MUFFLED EXPLOSION and:

                   He looks up and around for his best way out: deciding
                   he suddenly dives down, disappears and --

                   -- emerges out the open bay doors. He heads for the
                      surface and --

                   -- Kirk pops to the surface gulping for air. The rain
                      pelts him. He looks round.

                   -- The last of the survivors, Gillian and Spock emerge
                      safely.

                   -- Kirk relieved but where are the whales? And the
                      Probe's nagging GIBBERISH is heard again. He dives
                      once more...

                   comes toward us, stops to see:

                   George and Gracie emerge from the bay doors, and majes-
                   tically move away from the ship.

                   He watches in wonder; then heads for the surface.

             254   THE SURFACE - VARIOUS SHOTS - (TANK)                       254

                   -- Kirk surfaces near the floating bridge and the sur-
                      vivors. Rain pelts; fog obscures; and above all: the
                      still unanswered CALL of the Probe.

                   -- CLOSER: Kirk arrives at the wreckage, takes a hand
                      hold near Gillian and Spock, looks back in deep concern.

                   Now something few have seen: "George" swims into
                   center stage, undulates, and drops into a hanging ver-
                   tical position. Then he begins: WHALE SONG.

             256   EXT. SPACE - THE PROBE - (INTERCUT) - ILM                  256

                   It's antenna turns to the new SOUND. Then, it trans-
                   mits a NEW GIBBERISH, somehow more conversational.

             257   UNDERWATER - THE WHALE - (INTERCUT)                        257

                   As this new dialogue mounts, the Probe will always trans-
                   mit GIBBERISH from above, the whale will always answer
                   with WHALE SONG from underwater. But even the dullest
                   of us will sense the relaxing of concern and tension,
                   the almost conversational climax between the two commu-
                   nicators. And then:

             258   SPACE - THE PROBE - SPACEDOCK IN B.G. - ILM                258

                   It sends what sounds what like a farewell burst of 
                   GIBBERISH; then, a THRUSTER FIRES, and the Probe arcs
                   up and out of orbit into the far distance, leaving
                   Earth behind. As it leaves, the lights in SPACEDOCK
                   slowly begin to wink on.

             259   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - VARIOUS SHOTS - ILM               259

                   -- The rain begins to stop.

                   Suddenly, the great BOARD becomes reactivated. Lights
                   go on. SOUND and chatter return to normal.

                             On behalf of all of us, Mr. President,
                             I am authorized to plead guilty.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             So entered. Hear now the sentence
                             of the Federation Council:
                                     (clears throat)
                             Because of certain mitigating
                             circumstances, all charges but one
                             are summarily dismissed.
                                     (a buzz through
                                      the crowd)
                             The remaining charge, disobeying
                             orders of a superior officer is
                             directed only at Admiral Kirk.
                                     (looks up)
                             I'm sure the Admiral will recognize
                             the necessity of keeping discipline
                             in any chain of command.
                                 
                                           KIRK
                             I do, sir.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             James T. Kirk. It is the judgment
                             of this Council that you be reduced 
                             in rank to Captain.
                                     (uncertain buzz)
                             ... And that as a consequence of
                             your new rank, you be given the
                             duties for which you have repeatedly
                             demonstrated unswerving ability:
                             the command of a Starship.

                   Reactions, buzz, happiness, but the President gavels
                   for order!

                                           PRESIDENT
                                     (continuing)
                             Silence!
                                     (it is silent)
                             Captain Kirk, your new command
                             awaits you. You and your crew have
                             saved this planet from its own
                             short-sightedness... And we are
                             forever in your debt.

                   The tide breaks loose: everyone in the great hall
                   rises to a standing ovation for Kirk and the crew.
  
                                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

             268   INT. FEDERATION COUNCIL CHAMBER                            268

                   The last of the crowd is exiting. Kirk and the Crew
                   are accepting the last handshakes and congratulations.
                   Spirits are high. And Kirk suddenly turns to find
                   himself face to face with Gillian.

                                           GILLIAN
                             My own exonerated Kirk! I'm so..
                             juiced, I can't tell you!
                                     (she kisses him)
                             Bye, Kirk... Thanks.

                   She starts away.

                                           KIRK
                             Hey! -- Where you going?!

                                           GILLIAN
                             You're going to your ship, I'm going
                             to mine. Science Vessel. I've got
                             300 years of catch-up learning to
                             do.

                                           KIRK
                             You mean this is -- goodbye?

                                           GILLIAN
                                     (perplexed)
                             Why does it have to be goodbye?

                                           KIRK
                             Well, I... As they say in your
                             century -- I don't even have your
                             phone number. How will I find you?

                                           GILLIAN
                             Don't worry. I'll find you.
                                     (then)
                             See you around the galaxy...

                   And she is gone. Kirk shakes his head in affection and
                   disbelief, then turns to see:

             269   HIS POV - SPOCK                                            269

                   In a corner of the empty chamber, Spock waits stiffly
                   as Sarek approaches him.

             270   BACK TO KIRK                                               270

                   He sees, then waits discreetly, leaving them to talk
                   alone.

             271   ANGLE - SPOCK AND SAREK                                    271

                   As the father reaches the Son. A quiet moment in the
                   empty, echoing hall.

                                           SPOCK
                             Father...?

                                           SAREK
                             I will be returning to Vulcan within
                             the hour... I wanted to take my
                             leave of you.

                                           SPOCK
                             It is kind of you to make this
                             effort.

                                           SAREK
                             It is not an effort. You are my
                             son.
                                     (then, covering
                                      this emotionalism)
                             Besides; I am most impressed with
                             your performance in this -- crises.

                                           SPOCK
                             Most kind, Father.

                   Sarek looks at him uncertainly, wanting to hear some-
                   thing. Finally:

                                           SAREK
                             As I recall, I opposed your
                             enlistment in Starfleet... It is
                             possible that judgment was
                             incorrect.
                                     (Spock, an eyebrow)
                             Your associates are people of good
                             character.

                                           SPOCK
                             They are my friends.

                                           SAREK 
                             Yes, of course... Do you have any
                             message for your mother?

                                           SPOCK
                                     (thinks; then)
                             Tell her I feel fine...

                   HOLD on Sarek. It is his turn to raise a Vulcan
                   eyebrow. Now Spock crosses to the waiting Kirk. They
                   share a moment, and depart together.

             272   INT. SPACEDOCK - ILM                                       271

                   From the Dock in the distance, amid the great SHIPS, a
                   tiny SHUTTLECRAFT comes toward us slowly.

             273   INT. SHUTTLECRAFT - KIRK AND CREW - ILM BLUE SCREEN        273

                   A great window in the front of the craft gives everyone
                   a view of the ships and where they are headed. They do
                   not seem to know.

             274   POV - THROUGH THE WINDDOW (AND INTERCUT WITH SHUTTLE)      274

                   Various vessels, odd shaped, undistinguished. A
                   Reliant class, a Saratoga. As they watch:

                                           BONES
                             The bureaucratic mentality is the
                             only constant in the universe.
                             We'll get a freighter.

                                           SULU
                             With all respect, Doctor, I'm
                             counting on Excelsior.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Excelsior? Why in God's name would
                             you want that bucket of bolts?

                                           KIRK
                             Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a
                             ship.

                   Ahead, through the window, is Excelsior.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Whatever you say, sir.
                                     (to himself)
                             Thy will be done.

                   And then, through the window screen, it happens: the
                   shuttle, automated, begins a rising climb. The
                   Excelsior DISAPPEARS BELOW THE FRAME LINE and in the
                   near distance, a new SPACESHIP appears. It appears to
                   be a Starship of the U.S.S. Constitution Class.

                   The faces of Kirk and the crew light up.

             275   INT. SPACEDOCK - THE SPACE SHIP - CLOSE MOVING             275
                   APPROACH - ILM

                   It looks like the Enterprise. As we get closer, it is.

             276   INT. SPACEDOCK - CLOSER ANGLE - U.S.S. ENTERPRISE -        276
                   ILM

                   FAVORING the great dish; where in freshly painted
                   letters: "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE" and on the line below,
                   "NCC 1701 - A" A painter, in spacesuit waves cheerily.   

             277   BACK TO THE SHUTTLE                                        277

                   The emotion is high from all, but very restrained.
                   Kirk says it for all.

                                           KIRK
                             My friends... We've come home.

             278   EXT. SPACEDOCK - ILM                                       278

                   The great exit doors open. The U.S.S. Enterprise
                   emerges and heads out on a trial run.

             279   INT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. ENTERPRISE                            279

                   Shiny, new, refitted for anything that may come. And
                   the crew is where they belong, all at their stations.
                   And Kirk is in his Captain's chair.

                                           KIRK
                             Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.

                                           SULU
                             Aye, sir!

             280   SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - ILM                               280

                   The great vessel curves and heads out. Over this we
                   hear:

                                           KIRK'S VOICE
                             Space, the final frontier. These
                             are the voyages of the Starship
                             Enterprise. Her ongoing mission:
                             to explore strange new worlds... to
                             seek out new life and new
                             civilizations... To boldly go where
                             no man has gone before...

                   With that, the Enterprise hits WARP SPEED, and is gone
                   into the stars.

                   FADE OUT.

                                           THE END

                          been given hiber-sedatives to slow
                          down consumption of life support
                          reserves. Our chief engineer is
                          attempting to deploy a makeshift
                          solar sail with which to focus and
                          absorb radiation from a nearby sun
                          we are orbiting. We have high hopes
                          that this will, if successful,
                          generate power to keep us alive
                          indefinitely. If you would patch us
                          through to Engineering Control we
                          could link up with the technicians
                          there and hopefully lick this
                          problem. We will keep you posted on
                          our condition. Starfleet, and inform
                          you of any further developments.
                          Captain Randolph out.

                          Starfleet Command, this is
                          communications officer Trillya of
                          the U.S.S. Shepard reporting on
                          emergency status code zero one nine
                          five. Our condition remains the
                          same, the probe has neutralized all
                          power supplies and we are
                          functioning on reserves only. All
                          attempts to reinstate main power
                          have failed. Captain Clampett has
                          quarantined all but minimal support
                          crew due to failure of Bio-
                          Sterilization capsules containing
                          Vegan D virus, which has already
                          killed fifteen crew members. All
                          aboard are believed to be infected.
                          Atmospheric regeneration and
                          reclamation systems are not
                          functional, and all medical supplies
                          are spoiling due to refrigeration
                          shut down. At present condition
                          life support systems will be
                          exhausted within eight hours.
                          Starfleet, please advise...?

                   (as appearing in Scene 47)

                                          COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                          This is the President of the United
                          Federation of Planets with a Planet
                          Alert, Priority One: Do not
                          Approach Earth -- This is a Priority 
                          One warning to all Starships, repeat
                          do not approach! Earth is under the
                          attack of an unidentified orbiting
                          probe which emits transmissions on
                          an energy wave unknown to us. This
                          powerful wave, directed at our
                          oceans, has almost totally ionized
                          our atmosphere. All power sources
                          have failed or been neutralized.
                          All Earth orbiting Starships are
                          powerless. A cloud envelope has
                          enshrouded the planet causing heavy
                          rain and flooding. Temperatures are
                          dropping to critical levels. This
                          planet cannot survive unless the
                          Probe is responded to. The Probe's
                          transmissions dominate all standard
                          channels. Further communications
                          may not be possible and we have
                          discovered no methods to repel the
                          Probe or destroy it. Do not attempt
                          confrontation with the Probe!! Save
                          your energy, save yourselves. Avoid
                          the Planet Earth at all costs.
                          Farewell...

                             Starfleet Command, this is Admiral
                             James T. Kirk in route to Earth in
                             Klingon vessel. We have intercepted
                             and analyzed the call of the Probe
                             threatening Earth. With the help of
                             Captain Spock it is our opinion that
                             only the extinct species Humpback
                             Whale can give the proper response
                             to the Probe. Do you concur with
                             this opinion?... Do you read me?
                             Starfleet Command, do you read me?

                             Starfleet Command, we hope you can
                             hear us. If you read, Starfleet, we
                             are going to attempt time travel.
                             We are computing our trajectory at
                             this time.
