	FADE IN:

1    INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM

	O'BRIEN and KEIKO are coiled tightly together beneath 
	the covers, fast asleep. They both look very content, 
	luxuriating in the sensation of sharing a bed again. 
	MOLLY rushes inside in her PAJAMAS and excitedly jumps 
	into bed with them.

					MOLLY
			Wake up. It's time to go.

	O'Brien and Keiko stir and smile sleepily.

					KEIKO
			Hi, honey.

					MOLLY
			It's almost seven. Time to get
			ready.

					O'BRIEN
				(pretending not to know)
			Ready? Ready for what?

					MOLLY
			The picnic!

					O'BRIEN
			Was that today?

					MOLLY
			Yes! Don't you remember?

					O'BRIEN
			We'd better get going then.

					MOLLY
				(to Keiko)
			I'm going to wear my blue jumper.

					KEIKO
			Good idea, honey.

	Molly dashes out to get ready. O'Brien watches her go, 
	shaking his head in amazement.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       2.

1    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			I can't believe how much she's 
			grown. She must be four inches 
			taller than the last time I saw 
			her.

					KEIKO
				(affectionately) 
			And you must be five pounds 
			heavier. What've you been eating 
			while we've been gone?

					O'BRIEN
				(shrugs) 
			The usual.

	Keiko gets out of bed.

					KEIKO 
			Well, say goodbye to the usual. 
			I'm back and you're going to start 
			eating right again.

					O'BRIEN
				(hopeful) 
			Can it wait until after the 
			picnic?

	Off Keiko's look --

2    INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS

	where the family is making last minute preparations to 
	go. KIRAYOSHI is dressed and waiting in a CARRY-ALL, 
	Keiko is putting things into a picnic BASKET. CHESTER, 
	the O'Briens' cat, is curled up on the couch. Molly, 
	dressed in her favorite blue jumper, ENTERS carrying a 
	distinctive BRACELET. She holds it out to her mother.

					MOLLY 
			Would you help me put this on?

					KEIKO 
			Of course, Honey.

	Keiko puts the bracelet around Molly's wrist and snaps 
	it shut. Molly raises her arm to admire it.

					O'BRIEN'S VOICE
				(from the other room) 
			Where's the sunscreen?

					KEIKO 
			I already packed it.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER      2A.

2    CONTINUED:

	Keiko looks back for Molly, but she's gone to the 
	nearby table, from which she takes a PHOTO and brings 
	it to her little brother.

					MOLLY 
			This is where we're going, Yoshi. 
			See?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       3.

3    INSERT - THE PICTURE

	showing the O'Brien's, sans Yoshi, picnicking on a 
	meadow near some boulders. The picture was taken about 
	a year ago, before O'Brien sent his family to live on 
	Earth.

4    RESUME SCENE

					MOLLY
			Last time we went to Golana, you
			were inside Mommy's tummy.

	O'Brien ENTERS from the other room, shaved and in 
	CIVVIES. He wears a combadge.

					O'BRIEN
			We'd better get down to the
			airlock. The shuttle leaves in
			twenty minutes.

					MOLLY
			Can we bring Chester?

	Keiko's not fond of O'Brien's new cat and quickly 
	quashes the idea.

					KEIKO
			I don't think that's a good idea.

					O'BRIEN
			He might get lost.

					KEIKO
				(under her breath)
			On second thought.

	O'Brien shoots her a look.

					KEIKO
				(picks up basket)
			All right, let's go.

	Molly grabs her favorite doll as she heads for the 
	door.

					MOLLY
			Come on, Lupi.

					O'BRIEN
				(peeking inside the basket)
			No sausages?

	Off Keiko's mock scowl --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       4.

5    EXT. MEADOW - DAY

	The O'Briens have spread a twenty-fourth Century PICNIC 
	BLANKET down on a field of lush green grass near a small 
	outcropping of BOULDERS surrounded by brush.

	(NOTE: THE SAME SPOT AS SEEN IN THE PICTURE)

	Kirayoshi is asleep under a little pop-up TENT; Molly, 
	holding her doll, is sitting next to her mother, who's 
	brushing her hair. O'Brien sits contentedly drinking 
	in the scene.

					MOLLY 
			I know what I'm going to be when 
			I grow up.

					O'BRIEN
			You do?

					MOLLY 
			Mm-hm. I'm going to be an exo-
			bologist.

					O'BRIEN 
			An exo-bologist? What's that?

					MOLLY
			Someone who studies animals from 
			other planets.

					KEIKO
				(under her breath)
			Like Chester....

	O'Brien shoots her another look --

					MOLLY 
			Daddy, if you send us away again, 
			can we take Chester?

	This stops O'Brien in his tracks.

					O'BRIEN 
			Honey, I'm not going to send you 
			away again.

					MOLLY
				(hopeful) 
			You're not?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       5.

5    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			I only did it because it wasn't 
			safe for you to be on the station.

					MOLLY 
			I know.

					O'BRIEN 
			From now on, we're going to stay 
			together.

					MOLLY 
			Promise?

					O'BRIEN 
			Promise.

					MOLLY 
			Want to see me do cartwheels?

					O'BRIEN 
			You bet.

	She gets up and runs into the nearby grass to start 
	doing cartwheels. O'Brien smiles, happy as can be. As 
	Keiko starts pulling food out of the basket, O'Brien 
	leans in and makes faces at Yoshi.

					O'BRIEN 
			How are you, little fella?

	Kirayoshi VOCALIZES contentedly.

					O'BRIEN 
			I couldn't have said it better 
			myself.
				(sighs contentedly, 
				looks at Keiko) 
			Real sunshine, fresh air... you 
			and the kids. Life doesn't get 
			any better.

	Keiko smiles at her husband, feeling the same way. In 
	the background, Molly is now playing at the base of the 
	boulders, investigating the tall grass that grows 
	around them.

					KEIKO 
			That was a big promise you made.

					O'BRIEN
			I meant it.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       6.

5    CONTINUED:	(2)

					KEIKO 
			I know. But what if the war heats 
			up again and you decide the 
			station isn't safe anymore?

	O'Brien considers for a beat --

					O'BRIEN 
			I'll put in for a transfer. I'm 
			not going to be apart from you 
			ever again.

	Keiko smiles and leans in toward him. They kiss, until 
	suddenly the moment is shattered by MOLLY'S TERRIFIED 
	SCREAM! Miles and Keiko look back at the rocks, but 
	she's nowhere in sight.

					KEIKO 
			Molly?!

	O'Brien leaps to his feet and heads for the rocks. 
	Keiko scoops up Kirayoshi and follows.

6    THE ROCKS

	Miles frantically searches between them.

					O'BRIEN 
			Molly? Molly!

					MOLLY'S VOICE 
				(distant, hollow) 
			Help!

	Keiko arrives behind him, out of breath and holding 
	Kirayoshi.

					MOLLY'S VOICE 
			Daddy!

	Keiko tracks her voice and spots a HOLE in the ground 
	at the base of one of the boulders, half-obscured by 
	BRUSH.

					KEIKO 
			Over here!

	O'Brien climbs into the hole.

7    INT. CAVE

	O'Brien crawls along a ledge, trying to spot his 
	daughter.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       7.

7    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Molly!

					MOLLY'S VOICE
			Daddy!

	He peers over the edge, his face registering horror as 
	he sees...

8    MOLLY (OPTICAL)

	She's clinging desperately to another ledge several 
	feet below him, her feet dangling precariously above a 
	strange swirling VORTEX OF MULTICOLORED LIGHT. A short 
	distance from the Vortex is an alien control console. 
	Its displays are LIT UP.

					MOLLY
			Daddy!

					O'BRIEN
			Hold on, Molly. I'm coming.

	O'Brien lays flat and reaches his hand toward her, but 
	she's too far away.

9    CLOSE - HIS HAND

	just inches from where Molly's fingers are gripping the 
	ledge.

10   O'BRIEN

	his face straining with effort.

11   MOLLY'S HANDS

	losing their grip on the rock.

12   O'BRIEN

					O'BRIEN
			Hold on!

	But she can't --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - TEASER       8.

13   MOLLY (OPTICAL) 

	She SCREAMS as she falls into the vortex and 
	DISAPPEARS. The moment she does, SPARKS FRITZ from the 
	control panel and the portal. The VORTEX COLLAPSES 
	like a switched-off picture tube. The spot where his 
	daughter fell is now nothing but solid rock, encircled 
	by the ANCIENT ALIEN FRAME that encapsulated the 
	vortex.

14   O'BRIEN

	reacts to the inconceivable fact that his daughter is 
	gone.

									FADE OUT.

15   EXT. SPACE (STOCK OPTICAL)

	The Defiant in orbit of an earth-like planet.

16   INT. CAVES - LOWER LEVEL - DAY 

	A
 LADDER nows links this level with the ledge above.
	A short distance from the vortex's frame we see an 
	ALIEN CONTROL PANEL and some EQUIPMENT HOUSINGS, all 
	composed of incredibly ancient composite materials. An 
	alien SUPPORT BEAM has fallen atop the equipment, some 
	of which is open, revealing patches of CIRCUITRY of a 
	kind we've never seen before. Several STARFLEET 
	EQUIPMENT CASES are organized next to the alien 
	devices, and Federation field LIGHTING KITS are in 
	place.

	O'Brien scans the alien control panel with a TRICORDER. 
	He's intent, focused, nothing else matters to him. 
	Nearby, DAX is studying the portal itself. Two N.D. 
	ENGINEERS are working in the b.g.

	Keiko sits on an equipment case, dried tear-tracks on 
	her face, staring blankly toward her husband. She's 
	cradling a sleeping Kirayoshi wrapped in a blanket. 
	KIRA steps down from the ladder and pauses to hug 
	Keiko. The women don't need words to share what 
	they're feeling. Kira then proceeds to Dax.

					KIRA
				(re: the portal) 
			Have you figured out what this 
			thing is yet?

	Dax shoots a look the O'Briens' way, pitches her voice 
	low -- she doesn't want them to have to be reminded of 
	what happened to their daughter.

					DAX
			It's some sort of time portal. 
			From the chroniton signature, we 
			think it sent Molly about three 
			hundred years into the past.

	Kira looks down, takes in this grim news.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     9A.

16   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			I wonder what this place was like 
			three centuries ago...

					DAX
			Odo contacted the Bajoran 
			Archaelogical Institute to see 
			what he could find out.

					KIRA 
				(beat) 
			How do we get Molly back?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     10.

16   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX 
			First we have to find a way to 
			reactivate the portal -- it's been 
			abandoned for a long time and it 
			destabilized when Molly fell 
			through. The problem is, we're 
			not sure how this technology 
			works.

					KIRA
				(looking over at
				O'Brien)
			Something tells me the chief isn't
			going to stop until he figures it
			out.

					DAX
			Something tells me you're right.

					KIRA
			Assuming you can get it back 
			on-line, then what?

					DAX
			We punch a transport scanning beam 
			through the portal and try to lock 
			on to Molly's DNA signature.

					KIRA
				(following) 
			Then pull her back into the 
			present.

					DAX
			That's the idea.

	The panel O'Brien is working with FRITZES and SPARKS.

					O'BRIEN
			Bloody hell!

	He glares at it, furious. Kirayoshi, startled by the 
	noise, starts to CRY.

					KEIKO
				(comforting him) 
			Shh. It's okay.

	When O'Brien looks over at his wife and son, his 
	features soften. He approaches them, puts a comforting 
	hand to Keiko's shoulder. They share a look of worry 
	and hope.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     11.

16   CONTINUED:	(3)

					O'BRIEN 
				(gently) 
			Maybe you should take him up to 
			the Defiant. It's too cold in 
			here for him.

					KEIKO
			I'm not going anywhere.

	Miles can see she's determined not to leave.

					KIRA 
			I'll take him.

	Keiko hesitates, but O'Brien nods that it's all right. 
	Keiko stands and hands the baby over to Kira. O'Brien
	leans in to his still crying son.

					O'BRIEN 
				(softly) 
			It's all right, Yoshi. I'm going 
			to get your sister back for you.

	With a last look to Keiko, O'Brien moves off, calling 
	to the N.D. Engineers.

					O'BRIEN
			Give me a hand with this...

	As they prepare to tilt up the portal...

17   INT. DEFIANT - READY ROOM

	Kira's standing near a table rocking Kirayoshi and 
	singing a Bajoran lullaby as ODO looks on.

					KIRA
				(sings)
			-- renay teli tah beh-soh... renay 
			teli tah beh-soh, mo-zha ben'koh.

	She checks his face and sees that he's fallen fast 
	asleep.

					ODO
			You're very good with him.

					KIRA
				(smiles) 
			He knows me. I had him inside me 
			for five months..

	She gives the child a soft kiss on the forehead.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     12.

17   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(musing out loud) 
			I think I'd like to have one of my 
			own, someday...

	Odo shifts uncomfortably, changes the subject.

					ODO 
			According to the archaeologists I 
			talked to, the portal was built by 
			a civilization that vanished a 
			thousand years ago.

	Odo voices the unpleasant conclusion...

					ODO 
			Which means if Molly survived the 
			fall, she would've found herself 
			all alone.

	Kira reacts to this unsettling thought --

					KIRA 
			You're saying the planet was 
			uninhabited three hundred years 
			ago?

					ODO
				(nods grimly) 
			The first Bajoran colonists didn't 
			arrive until the turn of the 
			century.

	Kira considers Molly's sad fate...

					KIRA
			An eight year-old girl stranded 
			alone on a deserted planet.

	Odo tries to comfort her

					ODO 
			With any luck, the chief'll be 
			able to beam her out a few minutes 
			after she fell. She'll hardly 
			know she was gone.

	Off their faces as they cling to this hope...

24   EXT. MEADOW - DUSK

	A haggard and beard-stubbled O'Brien walks with Keiko 
	over the grass where their picnic took place not so 
	long ago.

					KEIKO 
			I'm scared, Miles. You've been at 
			it for over a day.
				(almost afraid to ask) 
			Tell me you're getting closer.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     14.

24   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			I think I've found a way to 
			modulate the temporal field 
			generators. If it works, Molly'll 
			be home in a few hours.

	Keiko knows her husband is showing more confidence than 
	he feels, and for his sake, she pretends to believe 
	him.

					KEIKO 
			She was so excited about coming 
			here again... it's all she could 
			talk about when I told her we were 
			moving back to the station...

	The irony is too much for her and she starts to break 
	down...

					KEIKO
				(through tears) 
			Our poor baby... where is she... 
			what happened to her... ?

O'Brien stops, pulls her close.

					O'BRIEN
			Shh. I'm going to get her back. 
			Everything's going to be all 
			right...

	They pull each other close, squeeze tight, and we can 
	see that they're gaining strength from each other, 
	regaining hope. A long moment, then a COM VOICE 
	interrupts.

					DAX'S COM VOICE 
			Dax to O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN
			Go ahead.

				(excited)
			The power convertor you asked me
			to reconfigure... ? It's ready to
			go on-line.

	O'Brien's eyes light with guarded joy.

					KEIKO
			What does that mean, Miles?

					O'BRIEN
			It means Molly's coming home.

	Off this moment...

25   INT. CAVES - CLOSE ON THE PORTAL (OPTICAL)

	The VORTEX swirls at IDLE, emitting an UNEARTHLY LOW 
	THRUMMING SOUND. O'Brien is at the alien controls, 
	running through the final checklist as Keiko looks on. 
	Dax and Bashir are at the Transporter controls.

	As O'Brien reads from his PADD, he visually verifies 
	each of Dax's responses, then double-checks it with the 
	expected value on his PADD.

					O'BRIEN
			Transporter interface link?

					DAX
			Synchronized.

					O'BRIEN
			DNA acquisition sensors?

					BASHIR
			Locked in.

	O'Brien double-checks his PADD, staring at it for a 
	beat.

					DAX
				(gently)
			We're as ready as we'll ever be,
			Chief.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     16.

25   CONTINUED:

	O'Brien looks up.

					O'BRIEN
			Let's do it.

	He turns to Keiko, who smiles bravely.

	Dax touches a control on the Transporter console. 
	Somewhere, we hear a RELAY ENGAGE. THE THRUMMING 
	INTENSIFIES.

26   THE PORTAL (OPTICAL)

	The vortex begins swirling actively, adding various 
	colors as its intensity increases.

	Suddenly, the alien device SPARKS. The COLOR and 
	INTENSITY of the INTERACTIVE LIGHT SHIFTS.

					O'BRIEN
			We're losing power!

	O'Brien tries to compensate as a DISTINCTIVE TECH SOUND 
	indicates the transporter has locked onto Molly.

					BASHIR
			We've got a DNA lock. It's her!

27   THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL) 

	The Transporter BEAM ENERGIZES. Its standard Starfleet 
	configuration is tainted with elements from the vortex, 
	which FRITZES OFF as a figure begins to MATERIALIZE.

	At first, we think it's little Molly, but as the figure
	takes shape, we realize it's a grown WOMAN crouched on 
	the ground, facing away from us.

	For a moment, the woman remains frozen in place. 
	Finally, she stands and turns to face us. She's a 
	Eurasian of about eighteen. She's barefoot, dressed in 
	skins and fur; her hair is matted, her hands smudged 
	with dirt. Her hands and arms have SCARS and 
	SCRATCHES; her nails are broken and jagged, and her 
	teeth are stained and chipped.

	She's holding a GOURD cradled in the nook of her arm, 
	and in her free hand, she holds a cluster of ACORNS 
	like the ones filling the gourd. It seems we plucked 
	her right out of a food gathering expedition. She 
	stares at her surroundings, fear rising in her eyes.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT ONE     17.

27A  CLOSE - THE WOMAN'S HAND

	as the acorn cluster drops from her fingers, we see 
	she's wearing the same BRACELET little Molly wore in 
	the Teaser.

27B  KEIKO

	as her eyes fall to the bracelet.

					KEIKO
			Molly... ?

	Molly stares at Keiko, and for a beat, we almost think 
	she might recognize her. But the moment Keiko takes a 
	step toward her, she gets scared and hurls the gourd at 
	her. She backs away in a crouch, looking for a way out 
	of the cave.

					O'BRIEN
				(stepping forward)
			It's all right... Don't be afraid.

	But his approach only terrifies her more. She reacts 
	like an animal afraid of being cornered.

	She sees the LIGHT coming from the hole in the cave 
	ceiling, bolts toward it, plowing right into Keiko with 
	a snarl.

	O'Brien tries to grab her., but she BITES him on the 
	arm. There's a quick scuffle, which only ends when 
	Bashir HYPOS her and she falls unconscious in O'Brien's 
	arms.

28   O'BRIEN 

	as he looks down at what's become of his daughter, then 
	up at Keiko. Off the anguish in their faces, we... 

									FADE OUT. 

                        END OF ACT ONE

                            ACT TWO                             

	FADE IN:

INT. DEFIANT - MEDICAL BAY

	An unconscious Molly-18 lies on a bio-bed. We start 
	CLOSE on her HAND, where we see her CRAGGY, DIRT-
	STAINED FINGERNAILS, then PAN UP her ARM to see the 
	SCARS and SCRATCHES left by her difficult and dangerous 
	life. We MOVE UP to her DIRT-SMUDGED FACE, her MATTED 
	HAIR, then PULL BACK to REVEAL Bashir scanning her with 
	a medical TRICORDER.

					BASHIR 
			There's no doubt about it. The 
			DNA sequences match. This is 
			definitely Molly.

	REVEAL O'Brien and Keiko looking on from nearby. 
	They're still trying to assimilate what happened, and 
	Bashir can see that they're both pretty fragile and 
	require delicate handling.

					BASHIR 
			My readings indicate she's about 
			eighteen.

					O'BRIEN
				(self-recriminating) 
			We pulled her out ten years too 
			late.

					BASHIR
				(gently) 
			It's a miracle you found a way to 
			get her back at all.

					KEIKO
				(clutching at straws) 
			If you tried again, maybe you 
			could pull her out when she was 
			still a little girl.

	Keiko hasn't thought through what this means, and it 
	falls to Bashir to deliver the news.

					BASHIR 
			If you retrieve little Molly, 
			there'd be no one to grow up and 
			become this Molly. You'd be
			erasing her existence.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO     19.

29   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
				(trying to convince 
				himself that it's still 
				an option) 
			But our Molly would be back.

	Keiko's instincts as a mother rise to the fore as she 
	looks at the girl's sleeping form.

					KEIKO 
			This is our Molly. We may have 
			missed ten years of her life, but 
			we don't have the right to take 
			them away from her.

	O'Brien knows she's right, and does his best to accept 
	it. Keiko reaches for a nearby CLOTH and begins 
	tenderly cleaning Molly's skin as Bashir prepares to 
	present more bad news.

					BASHIR 
			She's been deprived of human 
			contact for a long time. It's not 
			going to be easy for her to 
			re-assimilate.

	The O'Brien's share a pained look.

					BASHIR 
			Her language skills are going to 
			be rusty. The two of you are the 
			best hope we have of helping her 
			recover them.

					KEIKO 
			She didn't seem to remember us.

					O'BRIEN
			She was so scared I doubt she even 
			saw what we looked like.

	Bashir doesn't know how to break it to them...

					BASHIR 
			That's true, but don't expect her 
			to accept you right away. It's 
			possible that she blocked out the 
			memories of her earlier life in 
			order to cope with her isolation.

	This isn't happy news, but the O'Briens take the hit 
	and steel themselves to do what has to be done.

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO 20-21.     

29   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN 
			Just tell us what you want us to 
			do.

					BASHIR 
			I'm going to keep her sedated 
			until we get back to Deep Space 
			Nine. I've contacted Captain 
			Sisko and told him we need to set 
			up an environment where she'll 
			feel safe. He's having one of the 
			cargo bays converted. I want you 
			there with her when she wakes up.

					KEIKO 
			What happens then?

					BASHIR 
			I'm afraid there aren't any rules 
			in a case like this. We'll have 
			to feel our way through the 
			process...

	Off the O'Briens as they contemplate the road ahead...

30   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establish the station.

30A  INT. WORF AND DAX'S QUARTERS

	Dax is sitting on the couch with Kirayoshi, playing 
	with a stuffed TOY to keep him amused.

					DAX 
			-- and mister froggy goes... 
				(tickling him) 
			Wee!

	Kirayoshi smile and giggles. The door OPENS and WORF 
	ENTERS.

					DAX 
			Hi.

	Worf wasn't expecting Dax to be here, much less with 
	Kirayoshi. Not that he's unhappy about it -- in fact, 
	he likes seeing his wife playing with the child.

					DAX 
			We have a visitor.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO    21A.

30A  CONTINUED: 

	He gives Dax a kiss on the forehead, leans down to look 
	at Yoshi.

					WORF
				(to Yoshi; with mock
				sternness)
			And what exactly is this infant
			doing in my home?

					DAX
				(smiles) 
			I offered to watch him so the 
			O'Briens could spend time with 
			Molly.

	Worf nods and plays with Yoshi for a beat, until he 
	remembers something.

					WORF
			I thought you said you were going 
			to be working tonight.

					DAX
				(nods) 
			I was going to do a spectral scan 
			of that comet that's passing 
			through the Denorias belt.
				(to Yoshi) 
			But if I did that, who'd look 
			after you?

					WORF
				(a beat) 
			Me.

	Something flickers across Dax's features, but she 
	covers it and smiles.

					DAX 
			That's all right. I want to stay 
			with him.

					WORF
			Jadzia, you've been waiting for 
			that comet to come into sensor 
			range for weeks.

					DAX
				(shrugs) 
			There'll be other comets.

					WORF 
			Go.
				(gesturing for him) 
			I will take care of Yoshi.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO    21B.

30A  CONTINUED:	(2)

	Dax is touched by his intentions, and doesn't quite 
	know how to say what she has to say.

					DAX 
			Worf... you're very sweet. But 
			let's face it. You're not good 
			with babies.

	Worf bristles at this --

					WORF
			I raised Alexander.

					DAX
			That's different. He was four 
			years old when he moved in with 
			you. You never had to change his 
			diapers. Babies are a handful. 
			I should know. I had nine of them --

					WORF
				(he's heard it all
				before)
			I know. Five as a mother, four as 
			a father.
				(off her look) 
			I can handle a fourteen-month old 
			child.

					DAX
			I'm not saying you can't --

					WORF 
			Fine.
				(taking Yoshi)
			Go run your sensor scans.

	Yoshi looks like he's on the verge of tears (Who knows, 
	he might even be in tears).

					DAX 
			You're not holding him right.

					WORF 
			Leave us.

					DAX
			All right, all right. I'm 
			leaving.

	With a last look Yoshi's way, she EXITS. As soon as 
	she's gone, Yoshi starts to cry. Off Worf's face as he 
	tries to comfort the child...

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO    21C.

31   INT. CARGO BAY/SAFE ROOM

	The room has been adapted to include elements of the 
	planetary environment that Molly-18 is used to. About 
	a third of the space has been set up with BOULDERS, 
	GRASS, native PLANTS and a LARGE TREE big enough to 
	climb in.

	Keiko and O'Brien, now in uniform, sit on a ROCK a few 
	yards from the COT where Molly is sleeping. Other than 
	the bed, there's no other furniture in the room.

	Molly wears a loose-fitting JUMPSUIT and is curled up 
	in a fetal ball -- like an animal that's used to 
	sleeping outdoors, where it needs to conserve its body 
	heat. She's been cleaned up, her hair has been trimmed 
	and combed, and her teeth have been fixed and whitened.

	She stirs slightly, then opens her eyes, still groggy 
	from the sedative. She first focuses on the fabric of 
	the mattress, and strokes it curiously.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO     22.

31   CONTINUED:

	Then she notices her hand: the nails have been clipped 
	and cleaned up and the scratches and scars have 
	vanished. She stares at it with wonder, as if it 
	belongs to someone else. Then she becomes aware of the 
	clean new clothing on her body, and as she returns to 
	full consciousness, her fascination turns to alarm. 
	What's happened to her? Where is she? She bolts 
	upright and sees...

32   MILES AND KEIKO

	watching her with solicitous smiles that can't hide 
	their underlying anxiety. Keiko tightly clutches a 
	shoulder bag. They speak to Molly-18 in the soft
	coaxing manner that one would use with a small child.

					KEIKO
				(tentatively) 
			Hello, Molly. -

	Molly's still not used to the sound of human voices and 
	it throws her into a panic. She leaps off the 
	mattress, scrambles up the boulders, and climbs up to 
	hide in the tree. Finding her shoes uncomfortable, she 
	slips them off and lets them drop. She balances on her 
	thin perch with the natural grace of a tree-dweller. 
	From there, she regards her parents as if they are 
	potential predators.

	Miles and Keiko exchange a pained look, then advance 
	halfway across the room toward her, taking slow and 
	ginger steps. It's extremely difficult for them to see 
	their daughter flee from them in terror. But they work 
	hard to project a calm facade.

					O'BRIEN 
			It's all right, Molly. We won't 
			hurt you.

	Molly remains in a defensive crouch on her perch and 
	shows no sign of recognizing them.

	Miles and Keiko exchange a disconcerted glance. Keiko 
	gives her husband a slight nod to indicate it's time to 
	try something recommended to them by Bashir. He steps 
	over to a rock on which a few pieces of exotic FRUIT 
	have been left.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Molly) 
			Would you like something to eat? 
			I bet you're hungry.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO     23.

32   CONTINUED:

	O'Brien looks up and sees that Molly's eyes have 
	followed him to the food. Curiosity begins to 
	overwhelm her fear as the chief makes a big production 
	of picking up one of the melons.

					O'BRIEN
			Look at this. Golana melon.

	He takes a big juicy bite and relishes the taste.

					O'BRIEN
			Hmm, delicious.

	Molly raises her nose and sniffs the air, her eyes 
	ravenous. O'Brien holds the rest of the melon toward 
	her.

					O'BRIEN
			Here... it's for you.

	Molly stares at the melon as he sets it down on the 
	rock and backs away to rejoin Keiko.

	Molly's eyes dart from her parents to the fruit. 
	Finally, her hunger gets the better of her fear and she 
	climbs down from the tree. She clambers down the 
	boulders and edges toward the fruit -- watching her 
	parents in case they make an aggressive move. Miles 
	and Keiko stand perfectly still.

	Molly reaches the rock and snatches the fruit, stuffs 
	some of it into her mouth hungrily, shooting 
	apprehensive glances at them as she does so.

					O'BRIEN
			Good, isn't it?

	Keiko takes a few cautious steps forward.

					KEIKO
			Molly, do you remember me? It's
			Mommy.

	Molly backs away, not sure where to flee, or even if 
	she wants to anymore. She is, by now, as fascinated by 
	her parents as she is afraid of them.

	She stares at them, and we get the sense that she's 
	groping toward recognition -- but something about their 
	appearance doesn't make sense to her. She steps down 
	off the rockface and takes a few cautious steps toward 
	them.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO     24.

32   CONTINUED:	(2) 

	When she's some yards away, she peers at them intently. 
	(NOTE: MOLLY IS CAPABLE OF WALKING UPRIGHT; SHE ONLY 
	CROUCHES WHEN SHE'S SCARED OR RUNNING AWAY).

33   MOLLY'S POV

	of the O'Briens.

34   MOLLY

	as she studies them, then slowly crouches down, her 
	eyes fixed on their faces.

					KEIKO
				(quiet) 
			Miles, what's she doing?

35   MOLLY'S POV - LOW ANGLE

	as she looks up at the O'Briens. Her crouched 
	perspective duplicates that of an eight-year child.

					O'BRIEN
				(quiet) 
			I think she's trying to figure out 
			who we are. She probably 
			remembers looking up at us when 
			she was little.

36   MOLLY

	cocks her head slightly. Her brow furrows as she 
	struggles toward recognition.

					O'BRIEN
			That's right, Honey. It's Mommy 
			and Daddy.

	A small strangled whimper escapes her throat. O'Brien 
	sees they've cracked open a door in their daughter's
	mind, and he wants to wedge it open further.

					O'BRIEN
				(sotto, to Keiko) 
			Show it to her.

	Keiko carefully reaches into her shoulder bag and pulls 
	out little Molly's favorite Bajoran doll -- the one 
	established in the Teaser.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT TWO     25.

36   CONTINUED: 

					KEIKO
			I brought something for you.

	Keiko extends the doll. Molly recoils. But Keiko just 
	stands there, smiling, with the doll extended 
	harmlessly in her hand.

					KEIKO 
			It's Lupi. Remember how she used 
			to sleep right next to you on your 
			pillow every night? She's missed 
			you, Molly.

	Molly cocks her head slightly. Embers of memory begin 
	to glow in her eyes. Keiko extends her arm fully and 
	dangles the doll in front of her daughter.

					KEIKO 
			Go on, take her.

	Molly emits another soft whimper, moves forward a few 
	cautious steps, then pauses -- eyes dancing 
	suspiciously from Miles to Keiko, then back to the doll 
	again. Keiko remembers all too vividly how her 
	daughter attacked her in the cave and knows she might 
	do it again.

	Suddenly, Molly darts forward, quick as a cat, and 
	snatches the doll from her mother's grasp. Miles and 
	Keiko share a look of relief, then watch with 
	fascination as...

37   MOLLY

	stares at the doll in her hands. Recognition floods 
	her eyes. She strokes the fabric of its dress.

					KEIKO 
			Yes. That's right, it's Lupi. 
			You remember now, don't you?

	Molly listens intently to the sound of her mother's 
	voice, then looks at her parents and SMILES. It's the 
	first time we've seen this expression and the effect is 
	magical. Molly face is transformed and in this moment 
	everything seems possible.

	O'Brien takes Keiko's hand and squeezes it tight. OFF 
	their hopeful features...

38   INT. CARGO BAY/SAFE ROOM - CLOSE ON A COLORFUL BALL 

	as it rolls along the floor.

39   REVEAL 

	O'Brien and Keiko sitting on the floor a few yards from 
	each other. The ball's rolling from Keiko toward 
	O'Brien, who scoops it up.

					O'BRIEN
			This is a ball, Molly.

	Molly squats about ten feet from her parents, her 
	attention riveted on what. they're doing. For Molly's 
	benefit, Keiko gestures for the ball.

					KEIKO
				May I have the ball?

	He rolls it back across the deck toward his wife. 
	Their repeated gestures and requests are a conscious 
	attempt to re-familiarize Molly with the connection 
	between language and action.

	The room has changed since we last saw it. New items 
	have been introduced to re-acclimate her to the objects 
	of the twenty-fourth century and to try to stimulate 
	communication. An area along one wall, opposite from 
	the boulders and plants, has been adapted to 
	accommodate the O'Brien's needs while they spend time 
	with Molly. It contains a COUCH with a few PILLOWS and 
	BLANKETS, a table and a CABINET.

					KEIKO
				(to Molly)
			Would you like the ball?

	Molly stares at her watchfully.

					KEIKO
			Here.

	Keiko rolls it gently toward her. As soon as it's 
	within reach, Molly snatches it up and stares at them.

39   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
				(gestures for the ball)
			Give me the ball, Molly.

	Molly ignores him and runs over to where THREE OTHER 
	BALLS she's collected are tucked between some boulders. 
	O'Brien and Keiko share a frustrated look.

					KEIKO
			Julian said it might take her a
			while.

	O'Brien sighs, reaches into a nearby BAG, and pulls out 
	another BALL.

					O'BRIEN
			I hope she catches on soon. We're
			running out.

	O'Brien rolls the ball toward his wife.

					KEIKO
				(scooping it up)
			It's a ball, Molly.

	She rolls it toward O'Brien, who scoops it up and turns 
	to Molly, who's come back to squat a few yards away 
	from them.

					O'BRIEN
			Would you like the ball?
				(holding the ball toward 
				her)
			I'll give you the ball.
				(pulling it back)
			Then you give me the ball, okay?

	She cocks her head, working hard to understand. 
	O'Brien rolls it toward her. She snatches it up, but 
	this time, she doesn't run off with it.

					O'BRIEN
			Molly?

	Molly eyes him.

					O'BRIEN

			Give me the ball.

	Molly regards the ball, looks again at her father.

					O'BRIEN
			Please, Honey.

	Molly hesitates, then rolls the ball toward him. The 
	O'Briens break into wide grins --

					O'BRIEN
			That's it!

					KEIKO
			Good girl.

	Molly's smile lights up and she gestures for the ball. 
	O'Brien rolls it over, and without hesitation, she 
	rolls it to her mother.

					O'BRIEN
			That's my girl! That's my Molly
			O'Brien.

	O'Brien exchanges a victorious look with Keiko. Off 
	this...

39A  INT. WORF & DAX'S BEDROOM 

	It's the middle of the night. The LIGHTS are DIMMED, 
	and Dax is in her PAJAMAS sleeping. After a beat, the 
	door OPENS and an exhausted Worf shuffles in wearing 
	his PAJAMAS. We hear the SOUND of Kirayoshi crying 
	from the other room. Worf sits on the edge of the bed, 
	lets out a weary sigh.

					DAX
			Is he all right?

					WORF
			He's fine. He just won't go to
			sleep.

					DAX
			Did you change him?

					WORF
			I changed him.

					DAX
			Did you feed him?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE   29A.

39A  CONTINUED:

					WORF
			I fed him.

					DAX
			Did you read him a story?

					WORF
			I read him a story.

					DAX
			Did you sing to him?

					WORF
			Until my throat was raw.

					DAX 
			Sounds like you tried everything.
				(starting to get out of 
				bed)
			I'll take over from here.

					WORF
			That is not necessary.

					DAX 
			You're exhausted, Worf. Get some 
			sleep.

					WORF
			No.
				(with growing resolve) 
			I am a Klingon warrior and a 
			Starfleet officer. I've piloted 
			Starships through Dominion 
			minefields, I've stood in battle 
			against Kelvans twice my size, I 
			courted and won the heart of the 
			magnificent Jadzia Dax. If I can 
			do those things... then I can make 
			this child sleep.

	He turns to head for the door.

					DAX 
			Talk about losing perspective. 
			Listen to yourself. Why is this 
			babysitting thing so important to 
			you all of a sudden?

					WORF
			It is not important to me, it is 
			important to you.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE   29B.

39A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX 
			What are you talking about?

					WORF 
			You are judging my fitness to be 
			a parent.
				(before she can protest) 
			Do not deny it, Jadzia. I can see 
			it in your eyes. I have proven 
			myself a worthy husband to you, 
			but you are not convinced that I 
			would be a good father to your 
			children.

					DAX
			Who said anything about having 
			children?


	Worf fixes her with a look. He knows he's right, and 
	he doesn't want to argue the matter anymore.

					WORF
			Go to sleep. I have work to do.

	And with that, he heads out the door. Off Dax's face 
	as she considers his words...

40   INT. CARGO BAY/SAFE ROOM - LATER

	Molly's asleep in the tree, curled up in a nook formed 
	by two branches, her doll clutched to her chest. 
	O'Brien's dozed off on the couch. Keiko ENTERS, her 
	HAIR clipped back in a PONYTAIL. As she gets to the 
	couch, O'Brien greets her with a yawn.

					O'BRIEN 
			Hi.
				(indicating Molly) 
			She went to sleep about an hour 
			ago.

					KEIKO
				(marveling) 
			How does she keep from falling?

					O'BRIEN
			Got me.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    30.

41   O'BRIEN AND KEIKO

	as she sits down next to him, Keiko undoes the clip, 
	allowing her hair to fall free.

					KEIKO 
			Nerys said she could stay with 
			Yoshi until your shift's over.

	Keiko takes a brush and begins running it through her 
	hair.

					O'BRIEN 
			Good. I've fallen behind on my 
			repair schedule over the past few 
			days.

	But Keiko's attention has been diverted to something 
	else.

					KEIKO
			Miles...

	He turns to face the direction she's looking. There's 
	Molly, standing not ten feet away -- somehow, she got 
	down from the tree and approached them without being 
	heard.

	She's staring intently at Keiko, who's frozen in mid-
	brush stroke. Keiko runs the brush the rest of the way 
	through her hair, and this prompts a reaction from 
	Molly.

	She opens her mouth as if to say something and extends 
	her hand. Keiko and Miles exchange glances. Careful 
	not to spook her, Keiko holds the brush out toward her.

					KEIKO 
			Do you want the brush, Molly? You 
			can have it.

	Molly steps closer, approaches the couch where her 
	parents are sitting.

42   CLOSE - KEIKO'S HAND

	holding the brush. Molly's hand enters FRAME, but 
	instead of snatching the brush away, it CLOSES over 
	both the brush and Keiko's hand.

43   RESUME SCENE 

	The two women lock eyes for a moment, then Molly slowly 
	lowers herself down on the floor, pulling Keiko's hand 
	to her hair.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    31.

43   CONTINUED:

	She releases her mother's hand, and Keiko realizes she 
	wants her to brush her hair. Gently, Keiko runs the 
	brush through Molly's hair. Molly blinks as the 
	sensation awakens old memories within her body.

	The O'Briens share a look. It's the first time she's 
	allowed either of her parents to touch her, and it's an 
	electrifying moment. Off O'Brien's face as he takes in 
	the sight of his wife brushing his daughter's hair the 
	way she used to when Molly was little...

44   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	as Bashir walks with an excited O'Brien on his way to 
	his quarters. The chief is carrying a rolled up piece 
	of drawing PAPER.

					O'BRIEN
			More and more when I look at her,
			I can see the little girl she used
			to be.

					BASHIR
			Has she spoken yet?

					O'BRIEN
			No, but I can tell she understands
			what we're saying.

					BASHIR
			Does she respond to her name?

					O'BRIEN
			Absolutely.
				(unrolling the paper)
			Look at this. She drew it.

	He stops and proudly shows Bashir the drawing --

45   INSERT - THE DRAWING

	It's a child-like rendering of a landscape. The most 
	striking thing about it is that the trees have FACES, 
	as do the TWO MOONS hanging in the sky. It's as if 
	she sees the world around her as a living, breathing 
	thing.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    32.

46   RESUME SCENE

					BASHIR 
			Interesting.

					O'BRIEN
			Not bad, eh?

					BASHIR
			She anthropomorphized the 
			landscape.

	Bashir is thinking about what this could mean about her 
	psychology, but O'Brien is just plain proud of her.

					O'BRIEN 
			She loves to draw. Oh, did I tell 
			you? She's started eating with a 
			spoon.
				(moving again) 
			At this rate, she'll be reading 
			and writing in a few weeks.

					BASHIR
			Just be careful not to push her 
			too hard. If she gets frustrated, 
			she could withdraw and relapse 
			into old behavior patterns.


					O'BRIEN
			Don't worry, I'm not going to push her.
				(smiles) 
			I don't have to, she's doing fine 
			on her own.

	They EXIT TO --

47   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS

	as they ENTER and stop short when they see:

48   WORF

	sitting on the floor, holding a toy RATTLE and making 
	KLINGON BABY TALK with Kirayoshi. The child is 
	entranced.

					WORF
			-- bak-THEG durf wa-TACH doo-GA-ya 
			gung-gung-gung-

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/.98 - ACT THREE    33.

48   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR 
			Gung-gung-gung?

	Worf reacts to the sound of Bashir's voice and springs 
	to his feet, scooping up Yoshi in the process. He 
	immediately stiffens into his usual formal persona.

					WORF 
			I was instructing your son in...
				(making it up) 
			-- hehh-DUHPP.

					BASHIR 
			Hehh-DUHPP?

					WORF
			A Klingon exercise that teaches 
			children hand-eye coordination.
				(gilding the lily) 
			So they will grow to become 
			warriors.

					BASHIR
				(re: the rattle in
				Worf's hand)
			I get it. Sort of a... "baby's
			first bat'leth" kind of thing.

	O'Brien elects to take Worf off the hook. He reaches 
	for Kirayoshi.

					O'BRIEN 
			How'd he do?

					WORF
			He acquitted himself well.

					O'BRIEN
			Thanks for watching him.

	Worf nods, turns to go.

					BASHIR 
			Worf?
				(indicating the rattle 
				still in his hand) 
			You might want to leave that. In 
			case Yoshi wants to practice his 
			hehh-DUHPPing.

	Worf glares at him, hands over the rattle. Off this 
	moment...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    34.

49   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing the station.

50   INT. CARGO BAY/SAFE ROOM 

	O'Brien ENTERS to find an agitated Molly pacing like a 
	caged animal. O'Brien looks over to see Keiko standing 
	nearby, holding the hairbrush and wearing a pained 
	expression. She has been trying to catch her 
	daughter's interest, and failing.

					KEIKO 
			Come on, Molly.

	Molly ignores her mother.and continues to pace -- she 
	traces the same path with the exact same number of 
	steps, over and over again. O'Brien approaches his 
	wife with concern.

					O'BRIEN
			What's going on?

					KEIKO
				(worried)
			I don't know. She's been like 
			this for over an hour.

					O'BRIEN
				(taking a ball) 
			I'll see if I can try to calm her 
			down.

					KEIKO
				(worried) 
			I'd better get going. I've got to 
			pick up Yoshi and take him home.

	Molly stops in her tracks, turns to stare at Keiko. 
	She seems to want to say something, and when she 
	finally manages to eke out the word, it's in a small 
	voice, strangled from disuse.

					MOLLY-18 
			Owe-muh.

	The O'Briens stare at her in surprise.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    3S.

50   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Keiko? Did you hear that?

					MOLLY-18 
			Hoe-muh.

	Keiko approaches her.

					KEIKO 
			Molly? What are you saying, 
			sweetheart?

	She finally manage to form the word she means.

					MOLLY-18 
			Home.

					O'BRIEN 
			Home?

	Molly nods anxiously, touches her chest.

					MOLLY-18 
			Maw-lee.

					KEIKO 
			That's right. Molly.

					MOLLY-18 
			Maw-lee, home.

					O'BRIEN 
				(realizing) 
			You want us to take you home with 
			us?

	Molly nods animatedly

					MOLLY-18 
			Dah-dee home Molly.

					KEIKO 
			All right, sweetheart. We'll take 
			you home.

					MOLLY-18 
			Maw-mee home Molly.

	The O'Briens can hardly believe the magnitude of the 
	breakthrough that's been made.

					O'BRIEN 
			Yes, Mommy and Daddy are going to 
			take you home.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    36.

50   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Off Molly's happy expression --

51   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - LIVING ROOM

	Molly stands in the center of the room, her parents to 
	either side of her. She takes in her surroundings 
	warily. (NOTE: She's now wearing SHOES.)

					O'BRIEN
			Home, Molly. This is home.

	Molly looks confused, but at the same time, curious. 
	Suddenly she sees the window on the other side of the 
	room and rushes toward it with excitement.

52   THE WINDOW

	Molly presses against the sill and looks out at the 
	stars.

					MOLLY-18
			Starry stars.

	She smiles out at them as if they were old friends, 
	forgetting for a moment where she is.

					KEIKO
			They're pretty, aren't they,
			honey?

	The sound of her mother's voice brings her back, and 
	she turns to look at her parents.

					MOLLY-18
				(confused)
			Home?

					O'BRIEN
				(smiles)
			That's right.
				(motioning to her room)
			Do you want to see your room?

	Molly stares at the doorway, not sure what he means.

53   INT. MOLLY'S BEDROOM 

	Molly stands in the doorway, her parents behind her. 
	She hesitates, staring into what was once the center of 
	her world. Miles and Keiko watch, a little worried by 
	her subdued reaction.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    37.

CONTINUED:

	She enters and begins to look about. Over the years, 
	"My Room" had come to seem like a dream to her, an 
	imaginary place, and yet here she stands. Her eyes 
	take in the warm ambiance -- her dolls, her drawings. 
	Chester is on her bed, and she studies him for a beat 
	before moving to --

54   THE CLOSET 

	It's open, its rack full of colorful clothes. She 
	moves toward it, pulls out a dress and holds it up to 
	herself. Made for an eight-year-old, it's way too 
	small. Molly stares at it, unable to comprehend what's 
	wrong with this picture. In a sudden burst of anger, 
	she tears the dress in half and flings it to the floor. 
	Startled, the cat dashes out of the room. Molly moves 
	past her parents, who follow her, their smiles gone.

55   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	Keiko and O'Brien find her back in front of the window. 
	As she hears them come in, Molly turns to face them, 
	very agitated. Try as she might, she can't put the 
	pieces together.

					MOLLY-18
				(pleading)
			Home.

	Her eyes fall to the PICTURE little Molly showed her
	brother in the Teaser -- the photo taken at the picnic
	years ago. She rushes to it, her eyes devouring it.
	Then she holds it up to them.

					MOLLY-18
			Home.

					O'BRIEN
			No.
				(gestures)
			This is your home.

	Molly adamantly shakes her head waves the picture.

					MOLLY-18
			Home!

	The O'Briens realize what this means, that she thinks 
	of the planet as home, and it's a devastating blow.

					KEIKO
			Miles...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    38.

55   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			It's all right, Keiko. It's only 
			natural. She lived there a long 
			time. It's just going to take her 
			a little while to realize this is 
			home, too.

					MOLLY-18
				(pleading) 
			Molly, home.

					KEIKO 
			We know, honey. But we can't go 
			there right now.

	Molly angrily throws the picture down and moves away 
	from them.

					O'BRIEN
				(an idea forming)
			Maybe we can...

56   EXT. HOLOSUITE MEADOW (OPTICAL) - DAY

	Molly lets out a cry of delight as she runs across the 
	grassy field. She moves with animal grace and 
	boundless energy. O'Brien and Keiko walk rapidly 
	through the grass, trying to catch up.

					KEIKO 
			Look at her, Miles. She's so 
			happy.

	Molly drops to her knees, looks up at the sky.

					O'BRIEN 
			She has no idea it's a holosuite.

					KEIKO 
			It must be so confusing to her. 
			One minute she's on a space 
			station, the next she's running 
			around outside..

	Molly runs to a tree, touches it almost as if it were 
	a long-lost friend.

					O'BRIEN 
			There's no reason we can't bring 
			her here for an hour or two every 
			day. I'll talk to Quark about 
			scheduling a regular time.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    39.

56   CONTINUED:

	Molly begins doing cartwheels on the grass. Miles and 
	Keiko smile at the sight.

					O'BRIEN
				(calling out)
			That's my girl!

	Molly rolls around in the grass, luxuriating in the 
	feeling of being outside. A CHIME SOUNDS. Molly is 
	too absorbed to react, but O'Brien knows someone's 
	outside the holosuite.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Keiko)
			I'll be right back.

	O'Brien moves off, leaving Keiko to watch Molly.

57   HOLOSUITE DOOR (OPTICAL) 

	O'Brien taps the control panel next to the door, which 
	fills the frame. It OPENS to reveal QUARK, standing in --

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    40.


58   THE CORRIDOR (OPTICAL) 

	outside the holosuite, a pair of nasty looking KLINGONS 
	behind him. BAR NOISE intrudes upon the bucolic 
	sounds of the meadow.

					QUARK 
			Sorry to interrupt, Chief, but 
			your time's up. These gentlemen 
			have a reservation.

								INTERCUT WITH:

58A  O'BRIEN (OPTICAL)

	with the meadow behind him.

					O'BRIEN 
			I'll pay for their time if they 
			can wait another half hour.

	Quark glances at the two Klingons. They glare at him 
	like they're about to peel his lobes.

					QUARK 
			They seem to have their hearts set 
			on some afternoon carnage... now.

	O'Brien looks at the unyielding faces of the Klingons.

					O'BRIEN
			All right. Give me a minute.

	As O'Brien turns away, Quark turns to the Klingons.

					QUARK 
			Let me buy you gentlemen a drink.

	Quark starts to lead the Klingons down the corridor.

									END INTERCUT:

58B  INT. HOLOSUITE MEADOW - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

	O'Brien approaches his family. Molly's doing 
	cartwheels again and laughing. O'Brien swallows.

					O'BRIEN 
			Molly, honey, we've got to go.

	But as he approaches her, Molly darts away from him, as 
	if it's a game of tag.

					O'BRIEN 
			Molly.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE   40A.

581B  CONTINUED:

	She laughs as she eludes him --

					O'BRIEN
				(hating himself)
			Computer, end program.

	The meadow VANISHES around him.

59   OMITTED

60   THE EMPTY HOLOSUITE

	Molly suddenly finds herself in a small, confined 
	space. She's stunned for a moment, then erupts.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    41.

60   CONTINUED:

					MOLLY-18
			No!

	O'Brien gently takes hold of her arm.

					O'BRIEN
			We'll come back tomorrow.

					MOLLY-18
				(fighting him)
			Home.

	Keiko joins her husband's effort to guide her daughter 
	out of the holosuite.

					KEIKO
			We have to go, honey.

61   INT. QUARK'S - UPPER LEVEL 

	O'Brien and Keiko maneuver Molly out of the east
	holosuite, past the spiral staircase, and then by Quark 
	and the two Klingons, who now sit at a table with a 
	couple of TANKARDS of bloodwine.

					MOLLY-18
				(over her shoulder)
			Home...

					KEIKO
			You can come back here and visit
			every day. I promise.

	As the O'Briens reach the door that leads to the 
	Promenade, Molly wrenches free and dashes back toward 
	the holosuites. Quark moves to block her way.

					QUARK
			I'm sorry, little lady --

	She whirls on him and bites his arm. Quark cries out 
	in pain.

61A  THE TWO KLINGONS 

	stand. The motion draws Molly's attention to them.
	They look pretty threatening -- and they're between her
	and...

61B  O'BRIEN

	who's trying to reach his daughter, but the Klingons
	and several curious customers are now between them.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    42.

61B  CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
				(desperately) 
			Molly!

61C  MOLLY

	Panicked by the glowering Klingons, she whirls, leaps 
	onto the spiral staircase and hurtles down it.

62   INT. QUARK'S - LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

	Molly comes down the stairs. The bottom is blocked by 
	confused customers drawn by Quark's screams. She 
	vaults the railing and lands on a table full of 
	Bajorans. Drinks fly in all directions and so do the 
	Bajorans. STARTLED SCREAMS erupt from the other 
	patrons as Molly springs toward the dabo table, 
	scattering the PLAYERS. A WAITER tries to block her 
	path, but she brandishes a BROKEN BOTTLE and causes him 
	to back off.

62A  QUARK'S - MOLLY'S POV 

	The faces all seem hostile and threatening.

62B  MOLLY 

	She starts toward the door to the Promenade, but stops 
	when Odo ENTERS with TWO ARMED DEPUTIES. Molly spins 
	around and runs for the rear of the bar toward the 
	other staircase.

63   O'BRIEN AND KEIKO

	plunge down the east staircase in time to see their 
	daughter fleeing from the deputies.

					O'BRIEN
			Molly --

64   MOLLY 

	She charges through the archway that leads to the west 
	staircase just as a tall alien, MADRAT, steps around it 
	to find out what the fuss is about.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT THREE    43.

65   MADRAT - MOLLY'S POV

	Surprised by the sight of Molly rushing toward him, he 
	raises his arms to defend himself.

66   MOLLY

	She reads this as a hostile gesture and stabs him in 
	the chest with the broken glass. As Madrat goes down 
	clutching the jagged glass in his chest, Molly springs 
	for the west staircase.

67   ODO

	as he gives the order to one of his Deputies.

					ODO 
			On stun.

68   MOLLY (OPTICAL) 

	She's just starting up the stairs when the Deputy STUNS 
	her. She crumples to the floor. O'Brien and Keiko 
	rush to her side. As Keiko cradles their unconscious 
	daughter, O'Brien turns and sees --

69   MADRAT

	lying on the floor, bleeding.

					ODO
				(taps combadge) 
			Odo to Doctor Bashir, we have a 
			Medical Emergency in Quark's.

	Off O'Brien's face as he realizes his daughter has 
	seriously wounded someone and is in deep trouble...

									FADE OUT.

70   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	SISKO and Odo are explaining the situation to a grim 
	O'Brien. Neither of them like it any more than he 
	does.

					SISKO 
			The Tarkalean she attacked is 
			recovering in the Infirmary. 
			Doctor Bashir tells me he should 
			be on his feet in a few days.

	Odo gives O'Brien the bad news

					ODO 
			He's filed charges against her -- 
			assault with a deadly weapon.

					O'BRIEN
			She didn't mean to hurt him; she 
			was just trying to get away.

					ODO
			I tried to tell him that, but he 
			wasn't interested in hearing 
			"excuses." As far as he's 
			concerned, she's dangerous and 
			should be incarcerated.

					O'BRIEN 
				(aghast) 
			Incarcerated?

	Sisko holds up a hand to indicate it's not as bad as it 
	sounds.

					SISKO 
			I talked to the Federation 
			magistrate and explained the 
			situation. She wants Molly 
			brought to the special care center 
			on Dalvos Prime for evaluation.

	O'Brien knows what this means --

					O'BRIEN 
			They're going to keep her there, 
			aren't they?

	Sisko reluctantly admits:

70   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			We might be looking at a long-term 
			situation, yes.
				(trying to reassure him) 
			But it's the best facility of its kind.

					O'BRIEN
				(pleading) 
			Molly belongs with Keiko and me. 
			If she's going to make a 
			connection with anyone, it's going 
			to be us -- not some therapist she 
			doesn't even know.

					SISKO 
			I'm sorry. I wish there were 
			another way.

					O'BRIEN 
			Sir, please. Don't let them take 
			my little girl away.

	But there's nothing Sisko can do, his hands are tied. 
	Off O'Brien's face as he realizes he's going to lose 
	her...

71   INT. HOLDING CELLS (OPTICAL)

	An agitated Molly is pacing back and forth inside one 
	of the cells like a caged animal. O'Brien, Keiko and 
	Bashir are watching from outside. A DEPUTY stands off 
	to one side. Bashir is holding a TRICORDER toward 
	Molly, and he doesn't like the readings he's getting.

					BASHIR 
			Her system's flooded with 
			adrenalin.

	He turns to the O'Briens, concerned --

					BASHIR
			I'm not sure she can tolerate 
			being confined like this. It 
			could send her into shock.

	The O'Briens react to this disturbing possibility --

					BASHIR 
			We've got to find a way to calm 
			her down.

	O'Brien walks up to the cell door and watches her 
	tormented movement.

71   CONTINUED: 

	The hopelessness of her situation and his own impotence

	She keeps pacing, ignoring his voice.

	She stops, turns and sees her father.

	She bolts toward him with an imploring look --

					O'BRIEN
				(warning her) 
			Molly, don't.

	She runs smack into the FORCEFIELD, which FRITZES on 
	and throws her back. She glares at it angrily, and
	O'Brien can see that she's going to try again.

					O'BRIEN 
			No, Molly.

	But she throws herself at the forcefield a second time --

					MOLLY-18
			Home.

	The ENERGY CURTAIN FRITZES to life as she makes contact --
	she keeps throwing herself against it, oblivious to the 
	current flowing into her body --

					KEIKO 
			Miles!

					O'BRIEN
			Turn it off, damnit!

	The Deputy rushes to comply, and when the field FRITZES 
	OFF, Molly breaks through. O'Brien and Bashir try to 
	grab her, but she struggles to free herself.

					MOLLY-18 
			Home!

	Bashir has no choice but to HYPO her. After a beat, 
	her body slackens and O'Brien eases her to the ground. 
	He cradles his daughter's head as Keiko takes her hand.

					KEIKO
				(agonized)
			What are we going to do?

					BASHIR 
			It won't do any good to keep 
			sedating her. The bottom line is, 
			she needs open space, and lots of 
			it.

					O'BRIEN
			She's not going to get that at a 
			"special care" center.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR     47.

	Bashir can't argue with him. He offers the only hope 
	he has, even if it is short-term.

					BASHIR 
			I'll talk to the captain about 
			putting her back in a holosuite 
			for the time being.

					O'BRIEN
				(anger rising) 
			Fine. But what happens when they 
			put her on a transport? What 
			happens then?

	Bashir has no answer for him. Off O'Brien's face as he 
	grapples with the dilemma...

71A  INT. WORF AND DAX'S QUARTERS 

	Worf is pacing the room with a worried expression when 
	Dax ENTERS.

					DAX 
			What a day. I can't wait to get 
			out of this uniform.

	Worf's demeanor is the first clue that something's 
	amiss. She pauses and glances around at the empty 
	room.

					DAX 
			Where's Kirayoshi? I thought you 
			were going to watch him this 
			afternoon.

	Worf shifts uncomfortably, his eyes fall away from her.

					DAX 
			Worf, what's wrong?

	Bashir steps out of the bedroom, carrying a MED-KIT.

					BASHIR
			Kirayoshi took a little fall.

					DAX 
			Is he all right?

					BASHIR 
			Just a small bump on the forehead. 
			Happens all the time to kids his 
			age. A little sleep, he'll be as 
			good as new.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR    47A.

71A  CONTINUED:

	Bashir pauses and glances at both of them. Worf is 
	looking at the floor and Dax is looking at Worf. The 
	Doctor decides he'd better leave them alone.

					BASHIR 
			Well, I've got to get back to the 
			Infirmary.

	Bashir EXITS. Worf sinks grimly into a chair. Dax 
	approaches him.

					DAX
				(gently) 
			You want to tell me what happened?

					WORF
				(shrugs listlessly) 
			We were playing. I pretended to 
			be a grint-hound and chased him. 
			He was laughing so hard that he 
			didn't look where he was going and 
			fell against the edge of the 
			table...

	Dax can see that Worf is taking this very hard.

					DAX 
			It was an accident. It could've 
			happened to anyone.

	Worf shakes his head adamantly.

					WORF
			No. I was too rough with him. I 
			was careless.

	Worf stands, the matter settled in his mind.

					WORF
			You were right to question my 
			fitness as a father.

					DAX
			I never questioned your fitness as 
			a father! Don't put words in my 
			mouth.

					WORF 
			I failed Alexander, I failed 
			Kirayoshi and I would fail our 
			children, as well.

	He heads for the door --

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR    47B.

71A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX 
			Where are you going?

					WORF 
			I do not want to be here when he 
			wakes up.

					DAX
			Worf --

					WORF
			I'm sorry to have proven myself 
			unworthy of you, Jadzia.

	And with that, he turns and EXITS. Off Dax's face as 
	she realizes Worf is grappling with doubts and fears 
	she never suspected he had...

72   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS

	Keiko paces the room as O'Brien watches.

					KEIKO 
			We've got to do something. We 
			can't let them take her away.

	O'Brien has a plan, but he wants to protect his wife 
	from the consequences. To do that, he must lie to her --
	something he's never been good at.

					O'BRIEN
				(looks away) 
			We don't have any choice. We're 
			just going to have to hope Molly 
			can adjust.

	Keiko stares at him in disbelief.

					KEIKO 
			How can you say that? How can you 
			just give up?

	O'Brien looks away as if he'd rather not discuss it.

					KEIKO
				(realizing) 
			You're planning something.

					O'BRIEN
			What are you talking about?

					KEIKO
			I've known you a long time, Miles.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR    47C.

72   CONTINUED:

					KEIKO (Cont'd)
			You're planning something and you
			want to keep me out if it.

	O'Brien's caught, and he knows it.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR     48.

72   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			The less you know, the better.

					KEIKO 
			Why?

					O'BRIEN 
			Because there are going to be 
			consequences.

					KEIKO 
			Then we'll face them together. 
				(off his look) 
			She's my daughter, too.

					O'BRIEN
			Keiko, listen to me...

					KEIKO 
			Don't argue with me. I can be as 
			stubborn as you are.

					O'BRIEN
			I guess that's why I love you.

					KEIKO
			What are we going to do?

					O'BRIEN 
			We're going to steal a runabout 
			and take Molly back to Golana.

					KEIKO 
			But that'll be the first place 
			they'll look. They'll find her, 
			unless...

	Keiko realizes what he's planning, sits down heavily.

					KEIKO
			... unless we send her back through 
			the portal... into the past.

					O'BRIEN
				(nods) 
			Once she's through, we'll destroy 
			it. No one will ever be able to 
			find her.

	Keiko can't stand the thought of losing her forever.

					KEIKO
			We'll never see her again...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR     49.

72   CONTINUED:	(3)

					O'BRIEN 
			I wish there were some other way. 
				(trying to accept it) 
			Golana was her home for ten years; 
			she knows how to survive there. 
			She'll be all right...

	As hard as that is to accept, it's true. Off the look 
	between them.

73   OMITTED 

74   INT. HOLDING CELLS 

	The Deputy is still on duty when O'Brien ENTERS. Molly 
	lies unconscious on the ledge running along the back of 
	the cell.

					O'BRIEN 
			How is she?

					DEPUTY 
			Doctor Bashir said she'd be 
			unconscious for a few more hours. 
			We'll transfer her to a holosuite 
			before she wakes up.

					O'BRIEN
			There aren't any holosuites 
			available. Odo said we have to 
			take her back to the cargo bay.

					DEPUTY
			He didn't mention it to me.

					O'BRIEN 
			Check the log. He said he made a 
			note of it.

	As the Deputy turns to a wall monitor, O'Brien reaches 
	up and HYPOS him in the neck. He lowers him to the 
	floor and moves to the holding cell.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FOUR     50.

75   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	O'Brien supports the semiconscious Molly as he leads 
	her toward the airlock. Keiko's waiting for them with 
	a bag slung over her shoulder.

					O'BRIEN 
				(to Keiko)
			Did you get everything?

					KEIKO 
				(pats bag) 
			It's all here.

	O'Brien steps over to the airlock's control panel. He 
	uses his free hand to enter an access code. The 
	airlock slides open. Keiko moves to help him with 
	Molly and they start into the airlock.

					SECURITY OFFICER (O.S.)
			Chief.

	They stop, turn to see...

76   A STARFLEET SECURITY OFFICER

	a few yards down the corridor, his hand on the PHASER 
	at his side.

					SECURITY OFFICER 
				(taps combadge) 
			Thompson to Security. I found 
			them.

	Off the O'Briens' faces as they realize they've been 
	caught...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR - LATER

	Odo has now joined the group, and the Security Officer 
	is explaining what happened. Keiko and O'Brien, still 
	supporting the groggy Molly, listen apprehensively. 
	The airlock door is now CLOSED.

					SECURITY OFFICER
			-- they were trying to steal a 
			runabout.

	Odo eyes the O'Briens for a beat, then turns to the 
	Security Officer.

					ODO 
			Find out if Deputy Pinar has 
			regained consciousness. I'm going 
			to need his statement.

	The Security Officer nods and moves off.

					O'BRIEN 
			Odo, please. Let us go.

					KEIKO 
			If you put Molly back in a holding 
			cell, it could kill her.

	Odo studies their faces for a beat...

					ODO 
			I'm disappointed in you, Chief.

	O'Brien's heart sinks as he realizes Odo is unmoved --

					ODO 
			If anyone could break a prisoner 
			out of a holding cell and get them 
			off the station, I'd've thought it 
			would've been you.

	With that, he activates the control panel and the 
	airlock door SLIDES OPEN.

					ODO
			On your way.

	The O'Briens react with surprised relief. Keiko kisses 
	Odo on the cheek.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FIVE     52.

77   CONTINUED:

					KEIKO 
			Thank you.

	O'Brien helps Molly forward into the airlock. As he 
	passes Odo, he pauses, but he can't find the words to 
	express his gratitude. Odo reads his eyes.

					ODO
				(nodding to the airlock) 
			Go.

	Keiko takes Molly's other arm and the O'Briens guide 
	their daughter into the Airlock. Odo watches them. 
	Off this...

80   INT. CAVE - NIGHT 

	The cavern is illuminated by a FIELD LIGHTING KIT. The 
	transporter and other Starfleet gear seen in Act One 
	were removed when the Defiant left the planet and are 
	no longer present.

	O'Brien is working to reactivate the alien time vortex --
	the portal is dormant as he tries to restore power to 
	the control panel. His TOOLKIT sits beside him.

	Nearby, Keiko is showing Molly some things she's packed 
	for her in a SHOULDER BAG, items from a Starfleet 
	survival kit. As she picks through the bag, we might 
	see a blanket, Molly's ball, and her hairbrush among 
	the other items.

					KEIKO
			... there's also a blanket and a 
			knife.

					MOLLY-18
				(identifying the doll) 
			Lupi.

	Keiko smiles through the emotion of the moment.

					KEIKO 
			That's right, honey.

	Molly starts to rummage through the rest of the bag. 
	She finds the hairbrush and we...

81   O'BRIEN

	He completes his adjustments -- the CONSOLE LIGHTS UP 
	and HUMS to life. Satisfied it's operating properly, 
	he turns and sees --

82   KEIKO AND MOLLY

	His daughter sitting contentedly as Keiko brushes her 
	hair. His wife's eyes are moist with tears. He 
	approaches, wishing he didn't have to break up the 
	moment.

					O'BRIEN 
			Everything's ready to go. I 
			recalibrated the temporal field 
			generator. We should be able to 
			put her back at the same point in 
			time that we took her out.

	Keiko does her best to accept what they're about to do. 
	O'Brien touches her cheek, turns to Molly.

					O'BRIEN 
			Molly, honey... I want to show you 
			something.

	She follows O'Brien over to the console. He fights to 
	control his emotions as he works the controls.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FIVE    53A.

83   THE PORTAL (OPTICAL)

	The VORTEX FORMS within its frame.

84   MOLLY (OPTICAL) 

	Her expression brightens as the INTERACTIVE LIGHT plays 
	upon her face. She stands and walks over to the 
	portal. Her parents follow. She gazes at the swirling 
	light, mesmerized by it.

					O'BRIEN
				(gently)
			You're going home now, Molly. 
				(gesturing)
			Home is right through there.

					MOLLY-18
				(happy smile)
			Home.

	Keiko places the bag on her daughter's shoulder, 
	touches her daughter's cheek for the last time.

					KEIKO
			Mommy loves you, Baby.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FIVE     54.

84   CONTINUED:

	O'Brien pulls his daughter close, fighting back tears.

					O'BRIEN 
			I love you, too.

	O'Brien holds her for a long beat, then lets go. He 
	and Keiko regard each other, their hearts breaking. 
	It's time to let her go.

					O'BRIEN
				(barely gets the words 
				out) 
			Go ahead, honey.
				(indicates) 
			Home.

	Molly looks at the portal, then back at her parents. 
	She gestures toward the ceiling to the opening of the 
	cave.

					MOLLY-18 
			Stars... your home.

	Keiko and O'Brien look at one another. They weren't 
	expecting this level of understanding.

					O'BRIEN 
			That's right. Whenever you look 
			up at the stars, that's where 
			we'll be -- watching you.

	Molly smiles at the thought of them watching her from 
	above.

	Keiko brushes a lock of hair from Molly's face. The 
	act turns into a small caress. The gesture breaks 
	O'Brien's heart -- he gently indicates that she go 
	through the vortex.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FIVE     55.

84   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
				(to Molly)
			Go on, honey.

	Molly looks at her parents a last time.

					MOLLY-18
				(softly)
			Molly loves you.

	The O'Briens hold each other close, and watch as Molly 
	turns and steps into the portal, DISAPPEARING into the 
	VORTEX.

									CUT TO:

85   INT. CAVE - PAST - DAY (OPTICAL)

	The portal is TILTED on its side as it was when we 
	first found it. A shaft of SUNLIGHT pierces the cave 
	from the opening above. O'Brien, Keiko, and the 
	equipment they had with them are all gone.

	The SOUND of a NEARBY STREAM lets us know that in this 
	time period a small brook flows through the cave. The 
	stalactites are SLICK WITH MOISTURE, and the walls 
	GREEN WITH MOSS. The fallen beam is back where we 
	first saw it, laying atop some dusty equipment. The 
	console is OFF.

	Molly emerges from the VORTEX in a crouch, the bag 
	slung over her shoulder. She looks around the room, 
	visibly relieved to be back in her own environment. 
	She reaches her hand out to the shaft of sunlight and 
	watches as it glistens on her fingers, then tilts her 
	head back to follow the beam to its source at the mouth 
	of the cave.

					MOLLY-18
				(smiles)
			Home.

	With practiced skill, she starts to climb toward the 
	light, but her ascent is halted by a SOFT WHIMPERING. 
	Molly-18 cocks her head to listen. She drops back to 
	the floor and moves toward the sound, which seems to be 
	coming from behind a BOULDER. She moves to it and sees --

86   YOUNG MOLLY 

	cowering there. The eight-year-old Molly is a pathetic 
	sight. Her CLOTHING'S TORN, her hair a mess. Her face 
	and arms are SCRATCHED and DIRTY.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FIVE     56.

86   CONTINUED:

	She's been down here over a day. It takes her a second 
	to realize she's no longer alone.

	As Molly-18 crouches down to study the face of this 
	little girl, we can see the memories start coming back 
	to her. She was once this same scared child, huddling 
	alone in the dark.

					MOLLY-18
			Molly... ?

	Little Molly reacts to the fact that this stranger 
	knows her name. Molly-18 notices the BRACELET on 
	little Molly's wrist. She reaches out and gently touches it.

					MOLLY-18 
				(sure of it)
			Molly.

	Molly-18 stares at her younger self as the memories 
	come back to her.

					LITTLE MOLLY
			I want my mommy and daddy...

	Molly-18 turns and points to the vortex, to where she 
	knows Mommy and Daddy are.

					MOLLY-18
			There.

	Little Molly looks at the vortex, and we can see that 
	she's scared of it...

87   INT. CAVE - PRESENT - NIGHT (OPTICAL) 

	The O'Briens are staring at the vortex. As its light 
	plays on their faces, O'Brien moves to his TOOLKIT and 
	removes a PHASER.

					O'BRIEN
			You'd better take cover...

88   INT. CAVE - PAST - DAY (OPTICAL) 

	Little Molly stands reluctantly in front of the VORTEX, 
	afraid to go through.

88   CONTINUED:

					MOLLY-18
				(gestures)
			Mommy, Daddy -- there.

	But Little Molly's too scared. Molly-18 pulls Lupi 
	from her shoulder bag and places the doll in the little 
	girl's hand. Little Molly reacts with surprise at 
	seeing her doll, then Molly-18 gives her a gentle push 
	and little Molly steps through the VORTEX.

89   MOLLY-18 (OPTICAL) 

	The thought of her younger self being reunited with her 
	parents fills her with joy. As she watches Little 
	Molly go, her body begins to become TRANSPARENT and 
	DISAPPEAR -- her temporal matrix is destabilizing.

					MOLLY-18
				(smiles)
			Molly... home.

	And with that, she WINKS out.

90   INT. CAVE - PRESENT - NIGHT (OPTICAL) 

	O'Brien and Keiko have moved away from the portal so he 
	can fire on it from a safe distance. As he raises his 
	phaser, Little Molly STEPS out of the vortex. The 
	O'Briens are stunned and overjoyed.

	She runs into their waiting arms... off the image of 
	the family reunited...

			Hi.

	He acknowledges with a nod and scans the room for any 
	sign of Kirayoshi's things.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Time's Orphan" - REV. 4/15/98 - ACT FIVE     58.

92A  CONTINUED:

					DAX 
			You can come in... he's gone. I 
			dropped him off with the O'Briens 
			a few minutes ago.
				(trying to lighten his 
				mood) 
			You should've seen the look on his 
			face when he saw his sister again.

					WORF 
			Did you apologize to the O'Briens 
			for me?

					DAX
			Yes, and they said not to worry 
			about it. It's not the first time 
			he's bumped his head.

	This fails to brighten Worf's demeanor.

					DAX
				(testing the waters) 
			They invited us for dinner 
			tonight. They want to thank us 
			for watching him.

	The last thing Worf wants to do is to face the O'Briens 
	feeling like this.

					WORF
			What did you say?

					DAX
			I said we had a holosuite 
			reservation, but that I'd ask you.

	Dax can see he's not inclined to go, decides to let him 
	in on a little secret.

					DAX 
			By the way, what does... "gung-
			gung-gung" mean?

					WORF
				(suddenly intrigued) 
			Why do you ask?

					DAX
			It was the strangest thing. When 
			I was taking Yoshi home, he kept 
			shaking his rattle and saying 
			"gung-gung-gung."

92A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					WORF
				(brightening) 
			He did?

					DAX
			He seemed to be getting a kick out 
			of it. What does it mean?

	The thought that Yoshi took something away from their 
	time together starts to lift Worf's spirits.

					WORF
			That is between Yoshi and me.

					DAX
				(smiles) 
			I see. Well, you certainly made 
			an impression on him. Maybe 
			you're not as bad with children as 
			you thought.

					WORF 
			Or as you thought.

					DAX
			All right, so maybe I had my 
			doubts.
				(pulling his arms around 
				her) 
			But I've never been happier to be 
			proven wrong.

	They share a moment...

					DAX 
			We'd better get going if we're 
			going to make that holosuite 
			reservation.

					WORF 
			Holosuite -- and insult the 
			O'Briens?

					DAX
				(smiles) 
			We wouldn't want to do that.

					WORF
				(a beat) 
			Did he really say "gung-gung-

					DAX
			Over and over again.

93   INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - LIVING ROOM

	Miles and Keiko sit on the couch watching young Molly, 
	who's sprawled on the floor several feet away from 
	them, COLORING on some PAPER. Kirayoshi is nearby in 
	his playpen. Chester's curled up on a chair, asleep.

					O'BRIEN 
			The captain volunteered to 
			represent me at the hearing.

					KEIKO 
			If anyone can make Starfleet 
			understand what you did, it's him.

					MOLLY 
			Mommy?

					KEIKO 
			Yeah, honey?

					MOLLY
				(as she draws) 
			That girl who found me -- can I 
			see her again?

	Keiko knows she couldn't possibly explain time-travel 
	to an eight-year-old, and finds another way to answer 
	the question.

					KEIKO
				(wistful) 
			Not for a while, sweetheart.

					MOLLY 
			She was so nice..

	O'Brien ruminates about what happened for a beat, then 
	explains it to Keiko, as much for his benefit as hers.

					O'BRIEN 
			According to Dax, the 
			recalibration didn't hold, so the 
			portal sent her back to the same 
			point in time that it sent little 
			Molly.

	Keiko takes this in, tries to imagine what transpired 
	in the cave...

					KEIKO 
			I wonder if she understood that 
			the little girl she was looking at 
			was herself.

93   CONTINUED:

			I hope she did. And I hope she

			home, too.

	Keiko smiles at the thought, and Molly jumps up and 
	approaches them.

					MOLLY
			Look.

	She presents her finished drawing to her parents.

					MOLLY
			It's where we had the picnic.

	Miles and Keiko look down at the picture and are struck 
	by what they see.

94   INSERT - THE DRAWING 

	It's recognizably similar to the anthropomorphized 
	landscape that Molly-18 drew. Though the specifics are 
	different, the trees and the sun have faces in her 
	child's imagination.

95   RESUME SCENE

					MOLLY
				(worried)
			Don't you like it?

					O'BRIEN
				(puts his arm around
				Molly)
			It's beautiful.

	Hold on the family group as Miles and Keiko reflect on 
	this eerie and poignant moment...

									FADE OUT.
