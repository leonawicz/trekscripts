	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise sweeps toward a beautiful blue-green
	planet.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, Stardate 41294.5.
			Our destination, the Class M Beta
			Cassius planet known simply as
			Haven. It is a world...

2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

	PICARD sits alone in the Command Area. GEORDI is at the
	Conn, WORF mans Ops, DATA's at Science Station #1.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... so renowned for its peaceful
			beauty that some believe it to
			have mystical healing powers.

3    OMITTED

4    ANGLE ON PICARD

	He's lost in thought as he looks up at the viewscreen.

					PICARD
			Such a beautiful world. Legends
			say it has been known to mend
			souls and heal broken hearts.

5    TWO SHOT - DATA AND PICARD

	As Data looks up, considers Picard's statement.

					DATA
			Legends which are totally
			unsupported by fact, Captain.

            STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - TEASER            2.

5    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Legends like that are the spice
			of the universe, Mister Data,
			because they have a way of
			sometimes coming true.

					DATA
			They have intrinsic value
			regardless of the facts, sir?

					PICARD
			Facts are not everything, Mister
			Data.

					DATA
				(startled by the
				 thought)
			Indeed, sir.

	Picard nods. Data seems to be trying to add this
	blasphemous concept to his voluminous memory.
	Meanwhile, Picard addresses the Conn.

					PICARD
			Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.

					GEORDI
			Standard orbit, sir.

6    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise eases into orbit.

7    INT. RIKER'S CABIN (OPTICAL)

	CLOSE ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN working delicate harp
	instruments. These players radiate a warm sensuality.
	Their "harps" sound more like mandolins and pedal steel
	guitars.

10   ANGLE ON RIKER

	leaning back, fully enjoying this, until:

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.
			Your presence is requested in
			Transporter Room One.

 STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - TEASER            3.

10   CONTINUED:

	Riker sighs good-naturedly and gets to his feet. The
	SONG IS SOARING in the b.g.

					RIKER
			Sorry ladies. Duty calls.

11   ON RIKER AND THE WOMEN (OPTICAL)

	For the first time, WE SEE that the Musicians are only
	two feet tall. As he EXITS, Riker hits a switch and
	the Songstresses DISAPPEAR.

12   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM ONE

	Riker ENTERS, joining TASHA, GEORDI, and a TRANSPORTER
	CHIEF.

					RIKER
			Lieutenant, you needed me?

					TASHA
			Yes sir. There's an object of some
			kind beaming in from Haven.

					RIKER
			What is it?

					TASHA
			We're not sure. I'm holding it
			in stasis until we can register
			its exact nature. It's listed
			as a gift for Counselor Troi.

					RIKER
			For Deanna? From here?

					TASHA
			That's what I wondered about.
			She's on her way now.

					TRANSPORTER CHIEF
				(indicating his viewer)
			Surface Station approval coming
			in now, Lieutenant.

					TASHA
			Okay, let's bring it in.

            STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - TEASER            4.

13   ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)

	The object is beamed aboard. WE SEE the surprised faces
	of those in the room as a big black chest rests on the
	transporter pad. Its design is somewhat old-fashioned
	except for A ROUND SLEEPING HUMAN FACE ON ITS SIDE.
	The chest is seamless and featureless except for the
	slumbering Face. They circle it, looking for a way of
	opening it.

					RIKER
			Odd looking. Why would one of
			our people be getting a gift from
			this world?

	Anxious to solve this mystery, Tasha moves in for a
	closer look at the Face.

14   FULL SHOT - INCLUDING FACE (OPTICAL)

	Troi ENTERS the room, surprised to see them huddled at a
	chest.

					TROI
			What's going on?

	Tasha gasps as the Face's eyes pop open. The Face
	has come alive! Two bright red eyes scan the scene,
	stopping only when they fall on Troi. All eyes turn
	to Troi, who's as surprised as anyone.

					FACE
				(deep, booming voice)
			I hold a message for Deanna Troi!

	The Face grins wildly -- it seems overjoyed with the
	news it is about to reveal.

					FACE
				(continuing)
			Lwaxana Troi and the honorable
			Miller Family will soon arrive!
			The momentous day is close at
			hand! Rejoice!

	The Face then abruptly SIGHS and goes back to sleep.

					TROI
			No, oh NO... !

            STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - TEASER            5.

14   CONTINUED:

	Everyone turns to look at Troi, who is stunned and mute.
	There is an another silence... but nothing happens until
	Troi moves slowly to the chest and kneels close to
	examine the Face. THE CHEST SUDDENLY GOES BANG. A door
	flies open and dozens of brightly-colored gems and
	trinkets spill out. The astonished onlookers get a
	closer look at the items. Troi picks up a necklace
	made of red Betazoid jewels (like the ones she wears in
	her hair).

					TROI
				(continuing)
			I don't believe this!

					RIKER
			Counselor, what's this all about?

					TROI
				(softly; slowly)
			They're bonding gifts...
				(pause)
			... what you would call...
			wedding presents.

					RIKER
			Wedding presents? What wedding?
			Who's getting married?

	Troi slowly turns to look him in the eye.

					TROI
				(in shock)
			I am.

	Riker stares at her, immobilized.

	FADE IN:

15   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise orbits Haven.

16   INT. READY ROOM

	Picard and Riker are with Troi. Riker is naturally
	perturbed; this is a woman he's loved although without
	any commitment being made. Picard is sorry to lose this
	top quality counselor and he's curious over how it
	happened -- and also curious about the effect of this
	upon these key officers.

					TROI
			I was certain it would never
			happen, Captain. The years I'd
			spend on this mission, the
			distance it has taken me away
			from home...
				(a deep breath)
			As you must have heard, genetic
			bonding is a Betazoid tradition.

					RIKER
			But your father was human, Deanna.
			The Millers are human...

					TROI
			You'd understand if you knew the
			loveliness of my world. The
			Millers and my father knew it,
			they loved Betazed so that
			they adopted the customs and
			traditions, including this one.

	A hesitation, then Picard breaks in:

					PICARD
			Will you and your husband be
			staying with the ship, Counselor?

	Her eyes go first to Riker in a way indicating her
	answer has much to do with him. Then she answers the
	captain:

					TROI
			No, sir.

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           7.

16   CONTINUED:

	Picard sees this, decides it is time to leave them
	alone.

					PICARD
			Then... I'll just say
			congratulations for now, Deanna.
				(including Riker)
			If you'll excuse me.

	Riker and Troi nod and MUMBLE a kind of assent, their
	eyes very much on each other now. Picard EXITS. CAMERA
	MOVES IN ON THE TWOSOME who stand uncomfortably eyeing
	each other. Then:

					TROI
			Bill ... more than anything else
			in the world ... anything ... you
			want to be a starship captain.
			True?

					RIKER
				(beat)
			I love you, Deanna.

					TROI
			I can feel that.
				(nods; small smile)
			I know you love me... within those
			limits.
				(touches him)
			So almost more than anything else
			in the world, I want to honor my
			father's memory with this bonding.

	They look at each other. She has invited him to say
	more and he considers it.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			Did you hear carefully what I
			said?

					RIKER
				(nods sadly)
			Every word.
				(beat)
			I'm sorry.

	They exchange a long, long look. Then:

					TROI
				(nods)
			Come dance at my wedding.

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           8.

16   CONTINUED: (2)

	Interrupted by the SOUND OF A CHIME. Riker ignores it.

					RIKER
			I'll try.

	Then Worf ENTERS.

					WORF
			Message from planet Haven,
			Counselor. They wish to beam the
			Miller...
				(hesitates)
			... ah, wedding party aboard.

	She nods, EXITS. Then Riker EXITS too, leaving behind a
	Klingon who puzzles over the strange ways of humans.

19   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	Picard and Troi face the platform. The Transporter
	Chief stands by the controls, the platform in b.g.
	SOUND of TRANSPORTER EFFECT, then THREE FIGURES
	MATERIALIZE.

20   CLOSE ON TROI AND PICARD

	Troi's face reflects the fact that she's about to see
	her future husband for the first time in nearly three
	decades. Clearly, Picard is aware of the stress she
	feels and sympathizes.

21   WIDE ANGLE

	The Miller Family steps off the platform. STEVEN MILLER
	is a balding bear of a man in his late fifties.
	VICTORIA MILLER is small and slim, prim and proper.
	Their son WYATT is a likeable, blond young man with an
	easy smile and an open, honest face.

					PICARD
			I'm Jean-Luc Picard, captain of
			the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.

					STEVEN
			Quite some starship you have
			here, captain. Look forward to
			this visit.

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           9.

21   CONTINUED:

					VICTORIA
			Oh, yes, yes.
				(looks to Troi)
			You couldn't be...

					TROI
			... I'm Deanna.

					VICTORIA
				(dabbing her eyes)
			Deanna darling! You probably
			don't even remember me.

	Steven brushes by his wife and gives Troi a hug. Then
	he holds Troi off, looking at her but speaking to his
	wife excitedly. To one side Wyatt stares at Troi.

					STEVEN
			Wyatt was absolutely right,
			Victoria. She is a beauty.

	Wyatt steps forward. He looks at her, but his smile
	lacks something. Troi senses that something as she
	looks into his eyes.

					WYATT
			I'm Wyatt.

	He reaches out to her. When their hands touch, Mrs.
	Miller begins to cry.

					VICTORIA
				(to Picard)
			Isn't this simply beautiful?
			I knew romance was still alive
			somewhere.

22   ANGLE EMPHASIZING WYATT AND TROI (OPTICAL)

	Wyatt offers Troi a large rose: Navy blue petals atop
	a twisting golden stem. Troi studies the flower in
	wonder.

	The petals are softly TURNING from blue to white.

					WYATT
			I'd like you to have this. It's
			a Chameleon Rose. It changes
			color with the mood of its owner.

					TROI
			It's wonderful. Thank you.

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           10.

22   CONTINUED:

	She looks up from the rose and it seems Wyatt is
	studying her face. What's he looking for?

					STEVEN
				(to Troi)
			Deanna, did you like the chest?

					TROI
			Oh, yes. Especially the way It
			rolled its eyes at me.

					STEVEN
				(to Victoria; exuberant)
			You see, Victoria? I told you
			she'd love it!

					VICTORIA
				(to Picard and Troi)
			I was in favor of something more
			dignified.
				(looks at Steven
				 critically)
			Steven picked the ugliest face
			imaginable.

					STEVEN
			It was a fine face. Full of
			character!

					TROI
			Excuse me, but... when is my
			mother arriving?

	Mr. and Mrs. Miller go silent, giving each other knowing
	looks. Victoria frowns at the very mention of Mrs.
	Troi.

					WYATT
			Your mother's still down on the
			planet, Deanna.

					TROI
			Why?

	Wyatt takes the initiative -- prodding his parents
	toward the exit.

					WYATT
			Er -- is there a place for my
			parents to rest, Captain?

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           11.

22   CONTINUED: (2)

					STEVEN
			We're not really tired, son, and
			besides I'd like to see some of
			the ship.

					VICTORIA
			Steven, you know full well
			Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam
			aboard until we've cleared out.
			So...

	Slight pause. Picard fills in the breach.

					PICARD
			You can visit your quarters now,
			if you wish.

	Victoria nods her thanks and Picard leads the family to
	where a crewperson is waiting outside.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			See the Millers to their
			accommodations, please.
				(to Steven)
			I'll join you all later.

	As Picard turns and RE-ENTERS, the Transporter Chief
	looks up from a reading.

					TRANSPORTER CHIEF
			A Mrs. Troi ready to beam up, sir.

	Picard throws a look toward Deanna, gets a nod, then
	nods in turn to the Transporter Chief.

					PICARD
			So be it.

	As the Transporter Chief sets the Transporter controls:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Wyatt seems a fine young man.

					TROI
				(puzzled)
			Yes, he does... But I'm not what
			he expected.

					PICARD
			I don't understand.

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           12.

22   CONTINUED: (3)

					TROI
			Neither do I... but I'm definitely
			a surprise of some sort to him.

	THE SHIMMERING HUM OF THE TRANSPORTER EFFECT turns both
	heads toward the platform.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			I should warn you. My mother's
			a bit... eccentric.

	There's expectation as A GAUNT FIGURE IN A FLOWING
	BLACK ROBE materializes. He has faded white-grey skin
	and beady purple eyes. He moves smoothly and
	deliberately. Quite a ghostly figure this MR. HOMN.
	ANOTHER FIGURE begins to materialize. As it
	solidifies, CAMERA MOVES IN ON MRS. TROI, who looks
	like a Bohemian Queen. Her gown is striking, as is her
	jewelry. Her facial make-up, though unusual, brings out
	her high-cheekboned beauty. Behind her, a large,
	ornate luggage item has also BEAMED IN with her.

					MRS. TROI
				(looks around)
			Where is everyone?

22A  EMPHASIZING TASHA AND MOTHER

	Troi moves toward her.

					TROI
			Hello, Mother...

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
				(turning to Troi)
			Don't say it... think it. Use your
			mind, not your mouth.

	Troi refuses to go along, uses words, repeating:

					TROI
			Hello Mother.

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
			Deanna. Shame! What has this
			life done to you?

	Mr. Homn helps Mrs. Troi off the platform. Picard is
	about to introduce himself when Mrs. Troi cuts him off.

           STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE           13.

22A  CONTINUED:

					MRS. TROI
			Don't tell me. You're the
			captain.

					PICARD
				(smiling; nods)
			Of course. Your daughter
			explained your telepathic
			abilities.

					MRS. TROI
			That wasn't telepathy, it was
			common sense. Who else would they
			send to greet me but the Captain?
				(indicates luggage item)
			You may carry my luggage.

	This stumps Picard for an instant, but then he nods,
	STEPS ONTO the platform.

					TROI
			Mother!

22B  EMPHASIZING PICARD

	STEPPING TO the luggage item.

					PICARD
			No, no, quite all right. I'm
			indebted to your mother for
			the... the fine counselor she...

	The luggage item is much heavier than Picard realized
	and it takes so much effort to lift it that he
	GRUNTS-GROANS slightly and realizes he is trapped into
	displaying something less than a dignified figure.

24   INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE TRANPORTER ROOM

	As Deanna, Mrs. Troi, Mister Homn, and lastly Captain
	Picard MOVE OUT into the Corridor. Picard is laboring
	and Deanna looks toward him anxiously. A couple of
	crewpersons pass and double-take this strange use of
	their captain.

					TROI
			Mother, it's quite inappropriate
			to ask the captain to...

					MRS. TROI
				(to Picard)
			Yes, you do seem to be having
			difficulty. A man your age must
			work to keep himself in shape.

	Troi stops short.

					TROI
			I'm not going another step this
			way!
				(to Mother)
			A starship has its customs just
			as we do. Please set that down,
			Captain.
				(turning to Homn)
			If you're my mother's valet, then
			please valet!

					PICARD
			Well, so long as you insist...

	The Captain sets the luggage down gratefully.
	Meanwhile, Mrs. Troi turns to him apologetically.

					MRS. TROI
			I apologize for her behavior.
				(to Troi)
			Do you realize you've embarrassed
			your captain?
				(to Homn)
			Do as she says. Anything to avoid
			a quarrel on this occasion.

24   CONTINUED:

	The seemingly frail Mr. Homn bends, easily lifts the
	heavy luggage. Picard's look of astonishment at this is
	covered by Mrs. Troi taking his arm possessively and
	leading him down the corridor.

24A  PANNING SHOT

	Deanna hurries to walk with Picard and her mother. She
	indicates Homn following them with the luggage.

					TROI
			Mother -- what happened to Xelo?

					MRS. TROI
			I was forced to terminate his
			employment.
				(to Picard)
			Xelo was strongly attracted to
			me -- his thoughts became truly
			pornographic.

	They REACH a Corridor Turbolift where the doors snap
	OPEN.

	The turbolift will go upwards for a ways, then travel

					MRS. TROI
			As for me, I've found it shocking

			Or perhaps, I've just grown beyond

			I'll see what I can do. Now if
			you'll excuse me, I'm sure you

					MRS. TROI
			Yes Captain, you may go.

	Picard is only too happy to WALK OUT, past the strong
	Mr. Homn who begins to unpack for Mrs. Troi.

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
			You've been slack, little one.
			Allowed your mental powers to
			rust.

					TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
			To avoid becoming confused,
			mother. Humans constantly think
			one thing but say another.

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
			Yes, they do, don't they. The
			poor dears. Our style of complete
			honesty frightens them.

					TROI
				(switching to voice)
			On that subject Mother, there is
			such a thing as too much honesty
			with humans.

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
			Nonsense. It sets them a good
			example. If they'd only say what
			they think instead of hiding it...

					TROI
			But they're accustomed to hiding
			their thoughts...

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.
			And I quite understand what you

			How so?

			An incoming vessel has bypassed

					PICARD
			Are you saying you believe it to

					VALEDA
			Failure to communicate is

			We have no defensive capabilities

					WYATT
			Your mother's honest -- I respect

					TROI
			Yes, but she never lets up.

					WYATT
				(grins)
			I'll admit, her honesty is a bit

					TROI
				(nods)
			I've never heard it described

			I'll try to be only half as

			for whatever that's worth.

					TROI
			"Doctor?" Where? How?

					WYATT
			If you're picking up my thoughts,
			you'd know. Can't you do that
			at all?

	Troi concentrates on Wyatt, for a moment, then

			Absolutely. I've only felt this

			on this ship.

					WYATT
			Oh? Do I have competition?

					TROI
			No. All he wants is to captain
			a starship.

					WYATT
			What I want is to... well, to do
			another kind of brave and noble
			thing... which you may find
			prosaic. What I want is to cure
			people.

					TROI
			Well, since I am a practicing
			psychologist, maybe we can work
			in concert. We are going to be
			together a long time.

	His smile fades. He looks Troi in the eyes.

			Yes. That's the point of

			I really thought you'd tell me

32   EMPHASIZING PAINTING

	Troi has indicated the renderings that lie unpacked in
	a corner of the room. Each is a portrait of a
	STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. They have been drawn
	over several years and show development from girl to
	woman. There is a compelling intensity to the work.

				(continuing)
			I just felt your mind very much

			Yes.
				(faint smile)
			And I can see it'll be very hard

	Troi begins to sense the surprising truth. She
	indicates the pictures.

					TROI
			This is why you were surprised
			when you first saw me.
				(indicating)
			This woman... you thought that
			I would be this woman.

	She looks from Wyatt to portraits and back again. Wyatt
	touches one of the renderings.

					WYATT
				(with difficulty)
			I've seen this face since I was
			a boy. When I closed my eyes at
			night, I could hear her whispering
			my name.
				(pause)
			Knowing you were Betazoid, I
			assumed it was you, projecting
			yourself into my mind.

	Wyatt struggles with his confused feelings. Troi puts
	her hand on his shoulder, sincere.

					TROI
			I'm sorry I'm not what you hoped
			for...

					WYATT
			No. Please don't mistake a
			childish fantasy for
			disappointment. You're so
			beautiful, I-- I feel honored.

	It is clear they've begun to like each other... but also
	that they both feel more or less trapped by the
	agreement their parents have made. Troi looks back at
	the drawings.

					TROI
			You have no idea who she is?

					WYATT
			No. And it really doesn't matter

			No. You misunderstand.

			All guests must go unclothed.

	He smiles slightly -- thinking about it.

59   FULL SHOT

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing; to

			Don't worry too much, dear. Your

	Picard is bemused; Victoria is beside herself, so angry
	and embarrassed that she can't even spit out the words.

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing)
			Besides, your husband quite likes
			the idea of seeing me unclothed.

	Victoria jerks her head toward Steven who quickly puts
	his drink down and tries to look innocent, as:

					VICTORIA
			Steven!!

					MRS. TROI
			You did know he's attracted to
			me, didn't you?

					STEVEN
			Untrue! I don't.... Not really...

					TROI
				(rising; angrily)
			Stop it, all of you --
				(to her mother)
			Especially you!

					MRS. TROI
				(turning to Picard)
			Captain, as you requested, I have
			carefully avoided disagreements
			during this. But did you wish
			me to ignore what my senses tell
			me?

	Then Mrs. Troi shrugs and takes a bite of food. Homn
	strikes the BELL -- and Troi comes to her feet, knocks
	it off the table with the back of her hand and marches
	toward the door and is OUT before anyone can say
	anything.

60   CLOSE ON HOMN

	Laughing to himself, he then happily kills another
	glassful.

63   INT. HOLODECK -- DESERT LANDSCAPE (DUSK) (OPTICAL)

	His back to us, Riker stands in the desert, silhouetted
	against the horizon. This is a lonely, lifeless place
	-- beautiful but barren. A place picked to match a
	mood. Troi ENTERS SHOT, coming in through the archway
	as we PULL BACK to SEE the desert again. If Riker hears
	her coming, he doesn't turn around.

					TROI
			Why did you order up a desert?

	Riker gives her a look, then stares off into the
	distance.

					RIKER
			It matches my mood. Empty.

63A  CLOSER SHOT

	Troi concentrating on him, then nods.

					TROI
			Yes. It does.

					RIKER
			I lost you once before, and now
			I've lost you again.

					TROI
			Are you certain exactly who lost
			who, Imzadi?

					RIKER
			Don't use that word now, Deanna...

					TROI
			It means 'my beloved.'

					RIKER
			It also suggests the same feeling
			will go on ... tomorrow, and
			tomorrow...

					TROI
				(nods)
			It suggests a kind of bonding ... an

	Riker sits silently. After a long moment of waiting:

			Do you? Really?
				(turns; moves close)
			Imzadi... yes, you are my beloved.
			Today. But I can't lie to you
			and say I'm certain about tomorrow
			... and tomorrow ... I can't

				(moves close to a kiss)
			Because you are my Imzadi, I
			refuse to promise you a future
			I can't yet see.

					TROI
			How... would an Earth woman react
			to that, Bill?

					RIKER
			To an Earth woman, I'd lie.

			But you'd know it if I did.

			Hello you two!

63B  WIDER ANGLE

	They turn, see Wyatt MAKING HIS WAY IN from the Holodeck

			Next!

	Wyatt moves in and Riker CROSSES OUT OF SHOT toward the
	Holodeck entrance.

64   ON WYATT

	Head cocked, spinning around joyously -- taking in the
	wonders of the Holodeck. By the time he turns in a full

	Troi walks down to meet him.

					WYATT
				(continuing)
			I respected what you did
			tonight...

					TROI
			I lost my temper.

					WYATT
			It worked. You shamed them into
			compromise. After you left it
			really calmed down.
				(he laughs)
			The Joining will be half-Betazed,
			half-Old Earth. The Captain'll
			do the ceremony and Mister Homn
			will be my best man.

					TROI
			And we'll take our clothes half
			off?

	Wyatt laughs at this. It's clear he very much likes
	Deanna.

					WYATT
			Some of us all. You do... I
			do... Your mother, my father.
				(smiles)
			But not my mother.

					TROI
			How did you manage that?

					WYATT
			I didn't. Your mother did.

	They laugh together. She's beginning to really like
	Wyatt too.

					WYATT
				(continuing)
			And I just caught my father,
			practicing naked in front of his
			mirror.

	He imitates his father preening, holding in his belly
	and looking at himself from every side. They LAUGH.
	Troi sits on a small hillock, closes her eyes, stretches
	and lies back. Wyatt sits beside her, looking at her
	fondly.

				(takes her shoulders;

			Deanna... do you really want to
			go through with this?

					TROI
				(beat)
			Yes. I want to.

					WYATT
			I'm a very lucky man.

	He kisses her. Tentatively at first, gently. Then she
	begins to kiss back; he reacts to this and Deanna too.

			They built it underwater. At a

			Oh? How did you know that?

	Wyatt stops what he's doing, concerned, confused,

			My name is Wrenn... and before

			Your business is with me, sir.
			I am Captain Picard, commanding

					ARIANA
			Wyatt, you've come to us. Just

	Troi rises, hurries to Wyatt who speaks low-voiced.

					WYATT
			What's happening? Except for

					TROI
			I'm not sure but perhaps mother
			would...

					PICARD
				(interrupting; to Wrenn)
			Our first order of business,

			If you still carry the infection
			which destroyed your world...

					WRENN
			Oh, we still carry it, Captain.
			My daughter, I, all eight of us.

					PICARD
			Eight?

			All of us that are left, Captain.

77   CONTINUED: (2)

					WRENN
			No, no. We've learned to face
			the truth about such things. But
			Haven is a remarkably lovely and
			pleasant place, is it not? All
			we want is a resting place until
			the last of us are gone.

	Picard clearly feels the hurt of what he is going to
	have to say. It is in his voice:

					PICARD
			I'm... sorry, but circumstances
			make it impossible for us to allow
			you to beam down to Haven.

					WRENN
			We do not ask to make contact with
			those living below. All we ask
			is to be on the edge of some sea,
			some unpopulated island or faraway
			peninsula...

					PICARD
			This is not our planet, sir. I'll
			be happy to present your needs
			to those who govern this world...

					WRENN
			Present the fact we intend to die
			here, Captain. And if we die
			while caged by your tractor beam,
			so be it.

	Wrenn touches a control on his vessel, the viewscreen
	IMAGE FADES.

	There's a CHIME from the entry and Wyatt ENTERS.

					MRS. TROI
			Isn't this combination exciting?
			But I can't wear it, of course,
			since your father would be
			devastated if I weren't naked.

					WYATT
			Mrs. Troi, may I talk to you about
			something serious?

			I am always serious, dear boy.
			Only my pleasant nature makes it

	She continues fluttering with the jewelry decorating

					WYATT
			Please, Mrs. Troi.

	She turns, eyes him for a moment, then:

					MRS. TROI
			Yes, that was puzzling. A woman
			out of another place who insists
			she knows you.

					WYATT
			And...

					MRS. TROI
				(interrupts, nodding)
			And whom you've dreamed of for
			all these years.

					WYATT
			And I hoped that with you handling

					MRS. TROI
			Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily
			your thoughts come through. I
			wonder if it is because you were
			raised on Betazed?
				(smiles)
			Well, no matter, I can see you
			were wrong for my daughter anyway.

					WYATT
			Ma'am?

					MRS. TROI
			The answer to the puzzle of Ariana
			and you is too simple for most

			Too simple?

77A  CONTINUED: (2)

					MRS. TROI
			Of course. It's something they
			all know instinctively but go
			to great effort to reject or to
			build complicated superstitions
			about it. All life, Wyatt, all

			whenever it occurs... is
			indissolvably bound together.
			Indeed, it is all part of the same

					WYATT
				(startled; considers
				 it)
			Yes! I have wondered if something
			like that...

					MRS. TROI
				(carrying on his
				 thought)
			... weren't so. And no doubt so
			has Ariana, which helped the two
			of you to make contact.
				(touching neck

			Shall I wear the light or deep
			ruby stones? Which would be best
			for me, naked?

	But Wyatt's mind is elsewhere. He rises, heads for the

89   WYATT'S POV

	The room is minimally furnished, with an open door to
	what seems like a bridge, navigational equipment
	indicated beyond. But it's the walls that are
	mesmerizing. PORTRAITS OF WYATT, RANGING FROM BOY TO
	MAN, are everywhere. He moves about the empty room in
	astonishment, his heart pounding wildly. Suddenly he
	senses something behind him, and spins to see FIVE
	TARELLIANS standing in the doorway.

					WRENN
			Hello, Wyatt. We always thought
			you were a dream.

					WYATT
			You're not surprised. Did you

91   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Wyatt, I'm happy for you. Ariana,
			I love you both.

					MRS. TROI
				(softly)
			You've done surprisingly well for
			a human, Wyatt.

					TROI
			Mother...

					WYATT
			I take that as a compliment,
			Deanna.

	Wyatt smiles; Troi smiles, proud of her mother.

92   ANGLE ON THE MILLERS

	saddened, but becoming more confident of their son's
	judgment.

93   BACK TO SHOT

					WRENN
				(to Picard)
			My respects, Captain.

					PICARD
			And mine, sir.

	The Tarellian image begins to fade from the screen.
	CAMERA MOVES IN on Troi, who stares at the screen long
	after it's gone black.

					TROI
				(whispering)
			Good-bye.

94   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Tarellian ship pulls away from Haven -- heading for
	deep space.

95   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Transporter Chief at the controls. The Millers are on
	the platform. Picard, Beverly, Riker and Troi have come
	to see them off.

               STAR TREK: "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT FIVE              55.

95   CONTINUED:

					STEVEN
				(pleasantly)
			Keep the chest. You'll have use
			for it some day.

	Mrs. Troi ENTERS, followed by Homn carrying her
	luggage.

					MRS. TROI
			Seems such a shame to waste that
			lovely wedding dress. Perhaps I
			should stay and be Joined to a
			new mate.

					TROI
			What??

					MRS. TROI
			The captain is highly attracted
			to me, but he's a little too old.

	Picard lifts his eyebrows in surprise.

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing; to Riker)
			Perhaps I should choose you.

					TROI
				(sharply)
			He has other obligations, Mother!

					MRS. TROI
			-- Very well. It's his loss.
			Mister Homn!

	She kisses Troi and abruptly turns to step onto the
	platform... Homn grabs her bag and turns to the
	officers.

					HOMN
				(deep voice)
			Thank you for the drinks.

	The officers are caught off guard by his voice. Homn
	joins Mrs. Troi on the transporter pad.

					MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V. O.
			Try and remember your heritage,
			little one.
				(spoken)
			You may energize.

96   ON MRS. TROI AND HOMN (OPTICAL)

	As the transporter ACTIVATES, she stares at Picard, as
	if something shocking has just entered her mind.

					MRS. TROI
			Captain! Even Xelo never had such
			thoughts about me.

	Before Picard reacts, Mrs. Troi and Homn have been
	BEAMED AWAY.

96A  EMPHASIZING PICARD AND TROI

	He is still at a loss, but Troi is smiling at him.

					TROI
			That was meant as a joke, Captain.

					PICARD
			But she has claimed to be so
			completely honest.

					TROI
				(nods)
			Except when a lie is more amusing.
			Weren't you amused?

					PICARD
				(firmly)
			I was not!

97   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Our regulars all at their stations.

					PICARD
			Take us out of here, Mister Riker.

					RIKER
			Aye, sir.
				(to Geordi)
			Warp two, helm, heading five-seven
			mark three-one-nine.

	Riker lays a very happy look upon Troi and she returns
	it, as:

					GEORDI
			Warp two, five-seven mark
			three-one-nine.

					RIKER
			Engage!
