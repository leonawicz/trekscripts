                            TEASER                              

	FADE IN:

1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE

	CLOSE ON a happy, eight-year-old Bajoran girl, 
	SAHGI, as she runs up to SISKO. He is standing 
	beside KIRA watching several BAJORANS take down 
	various decorations from the walls of the shrine. 
	In the b.g., an orb ark sits on the altar.

					SAHGI
				(excited)
			Peldor joi, Emissary.

					SISKO
			Peldor joi to you.

	And with that, Sahgi runs off, back to her mother. 
	WE HOLD ON Sisko and Kira.

					SISKO
			Looks like the festival was a
			success.

					KIRA
			Everyone seemed to enjoy it. 
				(a beat)
			Thank you, captain.

					SISKO
			For what?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: ""Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - TEASER       2.

1    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			For insisting that the festival 
			take place in spite of the fact 
			that we're in the middle of a 
			war.

					SISKO
			War or no war -- we have a lot 
			to be grateful for. It's 
			important to remember that.

					KIRA
			Yes, it is.
				(a sudden thought) 
			Shouldn't you be heading over to 
			the wardroom for the ceremony?

					SISKO
			I'm on my way.

	And with that, Sisko heads out the door just as ODO 
	ENTERS. Odo seems a bit rattled as he makes a 
	beeline for Kira.

					ODO
			Nerys -- I've been looking for 
			you.

	Kira's expression hardens at the sight of Odo and 
	she turns her back to him.

					KIRA
			I don't really feel like talking 
			to you right now.

					ODO
			Don't you want to hear my side 
			of the story?

					KIRA
			No.

					ODO
				(telling her anyway) 
			Somebody has to maintain order 
			on the Promenade.

					KIRA

				(an accusation) 
			You arrested a Vedek.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - TEASER       3.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO 
			I'd hardly call it an arrest --
			he wasn't in the holding cell 
			for more than an hour. Besides, 
			he was breaking the law.  
			Fundraising on the Promenade 
			without a license is strictly 
			forbidden. Station regulation 
			fifteen-twenty-six, paragraph 
			seven--

					KIRA
				(cutting him off) 
			Vedek Solis was collecting 
			donations for Bajoran flood 
			victims!

					ODO
			A very worthy cause. 
			Nevertheless, station 
			regulations are quite clear --

					KIRA
				(fed up) 
			I don't care about station 
			regulations.

	Odo looks to change the subject.

					ODO
				(re: the orb, innocently) 
			Is that the Orb of Contemplation?

					KIRA
				(with finality) 
			Good-bye, Odo.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - TEASER       4.

1    CONTINUED:	(3)

	A beaten Odo EXITS. We HOLD ON Kira as she moves 
	over to help the others take down the decorations.

2    INT. WARDROOM

	SISKO stands before ADMIRAL ROSS who is holding a 
	small flat box. WORF, DAX, O'BRIEN, BASHIR and 
	JAKE stand ceremoniously nearby.


					ROSS
			... to Captain Benjamin Lafayette 
			Sisko, in recognition of your 
			remarkable leadership and 
			meritorious conduct against the 
			enemy, and in particular for 
			acts of personal bravery 
			displayed during the battle to 
			retake Deep Space Nine, 
			Starfleet Command is proud to 
			award you the Christopher Pike 
			Medal of Valor.

	Ross opens the box and hands the medal to Sisko. 
	The medal contains an engraving of Captain Pike.

					ROSS
				(continuing) 
			Congratulations, Ben.

					SISKO
			Thank you, admiral.

3    ANGLE ON THE OTHERS

	as they proudly look on.

					DAX
				(with a twinkle in 
				her eyes) 
			And to think... I knew him when 
			he was just a callow youth.

					O'BRIEN 
			I bet even then he showed signs 
			of greatness.

					DAX
				(thinking about it) 
			Only with the ladies.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - TEASER       5.

3    CONTINUED:

					JAKE
				(interested) 
			I'd like to hear more about 
			that.

					WORF 
			Then let him tell you.

					DAX
				(to Worf, re: Sisko) 
			But he'll leave out all the good 
			parts.

4    ANGLE ON ROSS AND SISKO

					ROSS 
			The medal usually comes with a 
			lot more pomp and ceremony, but 
			we figured you wouldn't want to 
			be called back to Earth just to 
			sit through a bad chicken dinner 
			with a bunch of brass hats.

					SISKO
			This suits me fine, admiral.

	Dax approaches and cranes her head to look at the medal.

					DAX
			Now you have something else to 
			put on your desk besides that 
			baseball.

					WORF
			What she means to say, captain, 
			is that she can't think of 
			anyone more deserving of this 
			honor.

					O'BRIEN
			I certainly can't.


					JAKE 
			I'm proud of you, Dad.

	Sisko and Jake hug.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - TEASER       6.

4    CONTINUED:

					ROSS
				(to the group) 
			If you'd excuse us, I'd like a 
			word with Captain Sisko.

	The others file out.

5    ANGLE ON SISKO

	as he faces the Admiral Ross waits for the door to 
	close, ensuring their privacy.

					ROSS 
			I've got good news for you, 
			captain. Starfleet Command has 
			decided we've been waging a 
			defensive war long enough. They 
			figure we're never going to win 
			this thing unless we take the 
			fight into Dominion territory.

	Off Sisko's small smile.

					ROSS
				(continuing) 
			I know, you've been saying that 
			ever since the Romulans opened a 
			second front against the 
			Dominion. It took a while, but 
			your message finally got 
			through.

					SISKO 
			When do we go?

					ROSS
				(smiling) 
			That all depends on you.

					SISKO
			Me?

					ROSS 
			That's right, Ben. Starfleet 
			has chosen you to plan the 
			invasion of Cardassia.

	And off Sisko's look of determination, we:

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:


	(Note: episode credits fall over opening sequence)

6    INT. QUARK'S

	Worf and Dax, carrying bat'leths, are coming down 
	the stairs from a holosuite.

					BASHIR (O.S.) 
			Finally.

	ADJUST to include an exasperated Bashir seated at 
	the bar. QUARK is standing nearby, behind the 
	counter.

					BASHIR 
			I've been waiting for you to get 
			out of that holosuite for twenty 
			minutes.

					DAX
			Sorry, Julian. We lost track of 
			the time.

					BASHIR
				(suspicious) 
			Doing what? You were supposed 
			to be in there exercising. I 
			don't see any sweat. Where are 
			the bruises? The broken bones? 
			The blood?

					WORF 
			We were... talking.

					QUARK 
			For an hour and forty-five 
			minutes?

					WORF 
			It's a private matter.

					DAX 
				(to Bashir) 
			We're thinking about having a baby.

					WORF
				(so much for privacy) 
			It was a private matter.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE       8.

6    CONTINUED:

	Both Bashir and Quark are taken aback by the 
	revelation. But before they can respond:

					SISKO (O.S.) 
			Sisko to Commander Worf. Please 
			report to my office immediately.

					WORF 
			Acknowledged.

	Worf nods to Dax, then EXITS. We HOLD ON Bashir and 
	Quark, who look at Dax somberly.

					DAX 
			You're both awfully quiet.

					BASHIR
			I don't want to dampen your 
			spirits, but I told you before 
			you got married that, medically 
			speaking, it wouldn't be easy 
			for a Trill and a Klingon to 
			have a child.

					QUARK
			And I'm worried the kid will end 
			up looking like his father.

					DAX
				(with saucy defiance) 
			I hope she does.

	And with that, Dax EXITS.

7    ANGLE ON BASHIR AND QUARK

	watching Dax leave.

					BASHIR
				(incredulous) 
			A baby?

					QUARK 
			It's bad enough she married that 
			Klingon psychopath.

					BASHIR
			A baby... you know what this 
			means, don't you?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE       9.

7    CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(nodding) 
			Their marriage is going to last 
			longer than we thought.

	And on their forlorn expressions, we go to --

8    INT. WARDROOM

	Sisko, Worf, O'Brien and GARAK are gathered near 
	the wall monitor which displays a graphic of the 
	Cardassian border. There are various PADDs 
	displaying star charts scattered about the table.

					WORF
			What about the Torg'Q system? 
			Of all the targets along the 
			border, it's the closest to 
			Cardassia Prime.

					GARAK 
			It's also the most heavily 
			fortified.

					WORF
			True.
				(to Sisko) 
			But that could work to our 
			advantage. The Dominion will 
			never expect us to attack there.

					O'BRIEN
				(skeptical) 
			The element of surprise might 
			give us an initial advantage... 
			but I'm not sure how long it 
			would last. And I don't even 
			want to think about our casualty 
			figures...

					GARAK 
			I recommend the Ventani System. 
			I know it's a long way from 
			Cardassia Prime, but its second 
			planet was the birthplace of 
			Tret Akleen -- the father of the 
			Cardassian Empire. 

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE      10.

8    CONTINUED:

					GARAK (Cont'd) 
			To lose such sacred ground would 
			be devastating to Cardassians 
			everywhere. And a great 
			propaganda victory for you.

					WORF 
			Even so, there is little 
			strategic value in holding the 
			Ventani System.

					SISKO
			And its loss would have no 
			effect on the Jem'Hadar.

					GARAK 
			True.

	Under this, Sisko notices that O'Brien has fallen 
	very quiet as he mulls over one of the star charts.

					SISKO 
			Something on your mind, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			What about the Chin'toka System, 
			sir?

					WORF 
			The Chin'toka System is 
			protected by a fleet of Dominion 
			ships.

					O'BRIEN
			The last time we patrolled that 
			section of the border, I noticed 
			something strange about the warp 
			signatures of their bigger 
			ships... the cruisers, the 
			destroyers...

					SISKO
				(interested) 
			Go on.

					O'BRIEN 
			They were slightly different 
			from the first time we scanned 
			them. The field variance 
			readings seemed almost too 
			synchronized.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE      11.

8    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO 
			Are you suggesting that the warp 
			signatures are fake? That those 
			ships are no longer there?

					O'BRIEN 
			It's possible.

					WORF
			Why would the Dominion pull so 
			many of their ships away from 
			the border?

					GARAK
			Perhaps they've been sent to the 
			Romulan front.

					WORF 
			Then how many ships does the 
			Dominion have at Chin'toka?

									SMASH CUT TO:

9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	CLOSE ON a wall monitor displaying a star chart of 
	the Chin'toka System.

					SISKO (O.S.) 
			Five squadrons of Jem'Hadar 
			attack ships.

10   NEW ANGLE (VPB)

	to REVEAL Sisko, GENERAL MARTOK and Admiral Ross 
	studying the map.

					SISKO 
			At the moment, that's the entire 
			Dominion "fleet" protecting the 
			Chin'toka System.

					MARTOK 
			Only five squadrons... It 
			appears you've found the weak 
			spot we've been looking for.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE      12.

10   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			Now all we have to do is 
			convince the Romulans to join 
			us.

					MARTOK 
				(grumbling) 
			That won't be an easy task. 
			They're an arrogant and 
			untrustworthy people.

					ROSS
			Without their help, we'd have 
			little chance of success.

					MARTOK 
			We will succeed. Mark my words. 
			By this time next year, the 
			three of us will drink bloodwine 
			in the halls of Cardassia's 
			Central Command.

	And off this moment of shared hope --

									CUT TO:

11   EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME (OPTICAL) (STOCK)

	Establishing.

12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM

	WEYOUN and DAMAR are in the midst of one their 
	acrimonious briefing sessions as a CARDASSIAN 
	OFFICER hands Damar a PADD for his approval.

					DAMAR 
				(annoyed) 
			You're worrying about nothing.

	Damar hands the PADD back and the Cardassian Officer 
	EXITS.

					WEYOUN 
			Am I? It's a mistake to 
			underestimate our enemy, Damar. 
			You're spreading our forces too 
			thinly.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE      13.

12   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR 
			Until we can find a way to bring 
			reinforcements from the Gamma 
			Quadrant, we have to make due 
			with what we have. Besides, you
			told me we needed more ships on 
			the Romulan front. So I sent 
			them.

					WEYOUN
			And in doing so, you left the 
			Chin'toka System vulnerable.

					DAMAR 
			Not as vulnerable as you think.

	Damar steps over to a panel near the wall monitor.

13   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 

	as the wall monitor comes to life displaying a three-
	dimensional model of a deadly-looking orbital 
	battle station.

					DAMAR (O.S.) 
			You see, we don't need starships 
			to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore.

14   ADJUST TO INCLUDE (OPTICAL)

					DAMAR 
			These are our new unmanned 
			orbital weapon platforms. Their 
			hulls are protected by 
			regenerative forcefields and 
			their arsenals include a 
			thousand plasma torpedoes.

	Weyoun studies the display carefully, and after some 
	consideration:

					WEYOUN 
			I like them.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE      14.

14   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR 
			I thought you would. Which is 
			why I've already ordered their 
			deployment.

15   OMITTED

16   NEW ANGLE

	as a Cardassian GLINN ENTERS looking somewhat 
	flustered and uncertain.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of'... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE     15.

16   CONTINUED:

					GLINN
				(to Damar) 
			Legate Damar, excuse the 
			interruption but we have a... 
			problem.

					DAMAR 
			What kind of problem?

					DUKAT (O.S.) 
			Me.

17   ANGLE ON THE DOOR


	to see DUKAT being led in by two N.D. Jem'Hadar 
	GUARDS. Both Weyoun and Damar are surprised by 
	Dukat's presence.

					DUKAT 
			Isn't anyone going to welcome me 
			home?

					WEYOUN
			Heroes get welcomed home, Dukat. 
			Not failures. Or have you 
			forgotten that under your 
			leadership the Dominion almost 
			lost this war?

					DUKAT 
			As I recall, you were right by 
			my side, agreeing with every one 
			of my decisions.

					DAMAR 
			If you're here because of what 
			happened to your daughter --

					DUKAT 
			You disappoint me, Damar. I 
			thought you, of all people,

				(open-armed) 
			Besides, I don't hold you

			You may have fired the phaser,

			forced your hand. And that's 
			why I'm here.

					DUKAT (Cont'd)
			The time has come for me to take
			my revenge against the good
			captain.

	Under this, Weyoun studies Dukat intently.

					WEYOUN
			We're in the middle of a life-
			and-death struggle for control
			of the entire Alpha Quadrant,
			and all you care about is
			quenching your petty thirst for
			revenge.
				(a beat)
			You haven't changed a bit, have
			you?

					DUKAT
			On the contrary, I'm a new man.
			I no longer have a need for
			conquest or power. I've moved
			beyond all that... I exist in a
			state of perfect clarity. A
			clarity I intend to share with
			the universe.

					WEYOUN 
			You're right, Dukat. You have 
			changed. You've gone from being 
			a self-important egotist to a 
			self-deluded madman. I hardly 
			call that an improvement.
				(to the glinn) 
			I don't have time for this. 
			Remove him.

	But Damar intercedes.

					DAMAR 
			Wait.
				(to Dukat) 
			Why did you come here?

					DUKAT 
			Isn't that obvious?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT ONE      17.

18   CLOSE ON DUKAT

	as he steps closer to Damar and Weyoun.

					DUKAT 
			To give you what you desire 
			above all else. The Alpha 
			Quadrant.

	Weyoun LAUGHS derisively. But Damar is willing to 
	take his old mentor seriously.

					DUKAT 
			All I need is a certain Bajoran 
			artifact... one of the many that 
			the Cardassians "appropriated" 
			during the occupation.

					WEYOUN
			And how is this artifact going 
			to help us?

					DUKAT 
			Let's just say it will make it 
			possible for Dominion 
			reinforcements to come through 
			the wormhole and destroy Captain
			Sisko and the Federation once 
			and for all.

	Weyoun and Damar are both intrigued by Dukat's 
	revelation. And off Dukat's satisfied expression:

									FADE OUT.

19   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) 

	The invasion force has begun to assemble around the 
	station. It is primarily composed of Federation and 
	Klingon ships, though there are a few Romulan 
	warships hovering about.

20   INT. WARDROOM

	Sisko, Worf, Martok, Ross and SEVERAL OTHER 
	STARFLEET AND KLINGON BRASS sit across from a 
	ROMULAN DELEGATION. The conversation is heated, as 
	a Romulan Senator, LETANT, aristocratically sits 
	back in his chair, sneering with disdain as only a 
	Romulan can.

					LETANT
				(to Sisko, re: 
				Martok) 
			Really, Captain, I see no reason 
			why I should sit here while this 
			Klingon jackal calls me a 
			coward.

	Across the table, Martok leaps to his feet.

					MARTOK 
			Apparently, this "jackal" has 
			more courage than the entire 
			Romulan Senate.

					LETANT
				(to Sisko)
			You see my point?

					WORF
				(to Martok) 
			General, you must try to remain 
			calm.

					MARTOK 
			Calm? This is'no time for calm --
				(to Letant) 
			-- it's time to strike the 
			enemy, strike them hard.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      19.

20   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			We found their weak point. Now
			we need to exploit it.

					MARTOK
				(to Sisko, re:
				Letant)
			But this p'tagh would rather sit
			home and count his dead.

					LETANT 
			If we invade Cardassia now, all 
			we'll do is count our dead.

	Sisko raises his arms in a conciliatory manner.

					SISKO
			Gentlemen, please. We're 
			allies, remember that.

					MARTOK 
			What good is an ally that'll 
			stab you in the back?

	The Senator leans over to speak to another Romulan, 
	but his voice is loud enough for everyone to hear.

					LETANT
				(re: Martok)
			Notice the primitive rage in his 
			eye... the uncontrolled 
			brutality. Klingons can be 
			quite entertaining, don't you 
			agree? I think every Romulan 
			zoo should have a pair.

	Martok's anger flares as he reaches for his dagger, 
	but Sisko's hand grabs his before he can unsheathe 
	the weapon.

					SISKO 
			Sit down, general. Save your 
			anger for the Dominion.

	Martok glares at Sisko, but Worf stands on the other 
	side of Martok and rests his hand on his shoulder, 
	reassuringly. Martok takes a deep breath, regaining 
	his composure. Glaring across the table at the 
	Senator, who smiles contemptuously at him, Martok 
	finally sits back in his chair.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      20.

20   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO 
			Senator -- you've studied our 
			invasion plans...

					LETANT 
			I have. And I remain convinced 
			they're premature. Let the 
			Dominion continue to send their 
			fleets against us. We will 
			annihilate them one by one.

					ROSS
			And they'll continue to rebuild 
			their ships and send more.

					WORF
			The Dominion breed Jem'Hadar 
			faster than we can destroy them.

					SISKO
			The only way to achieve lasting 
			victory is to demolish their 
			shipyards, their weapon 
			plants... to force them to 
			retreat, deeper and deeper into 
			their own territory until our 
			ships surround their 
			headquarters on Cardassia Prime 
			and they have no choice but to 
			surrender. I know it won't be 
			easy... I know we'll pay a heavy 
			price for every system we take 
			from them. But, in the end, 
			it's the only way to drive the 
			Dominion out of the Alpha 
			Quadrant. And that's a goal we 
			all share. Klingons, Humans 
			and Romulans.

	Sisko stares at Letant, who eyes the captain 
	thoughtfully. And off the Senator's enigmatic 
	expression, we go to --

21   INT. QUARK'S

	A glum-looking Odo sits beside an even glummer-
	looking Bashir, while a glummest-looking Quark 
	commiserates from across the bar.

					ODO 
			What am I going to do? Nerys 
			hates me.

					BASHIR
			I envy you. At least hate is an 
			emotion. All I get from Jadzia 
			is indifference.

					QUARK
			Me, too.

					ODO
				(wistful) 
			For one brief moment, I was the 
			happiest man in the universe. 
			Now... it's over. I'll never be 
			happy again.


					BASHIR 
			I know what you mean.

					QUARK 
			Me, too.

					ODO 
			What am I going to do without 
			her?

					BASHIR
				(still thinking of 
				Dax) 
			I wish I knew.

					QUARK
			Me, too.

	With a sigh, Odo gets up from the stool.

					ODO 
			I guess there's nothing else to 
			do but go back to work.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      22.

21   CONTINUED: 

					BASHIR 
			Good idea.

	And with that, Odo EXITS. Bashir and Quark watch 
	him leave.

					BASHIR
			I think we cheered him up.

					QUARK
			Me, too.
				(a beat) 
			I wish there was someone to 
			cheer us up.

					BASHIR
				(a sudden thought) 
			I know just the person.

	And as Quark looks over at Bashir, we go to --

22   INT. HOLOSUITE - LAS VEGAS LOUNGE

	where the inimitable VIC FONTAINE, with his BAND 
	behind him, is SINGING that swinging tribute to one 
	and all, "Here's to the Losers."

23   NEW ANGLE

	to REVEAL Bashir and Quark seated at the only table 
	in the joint, listening forlornly. As the song 
	ends, Bashir and Quark applaud halfheartedly.

					BASHIR 
			That was great, VIC.

					VIC 
			It's not exactly the most 
			requested song in my repertoire, 
			but I'm glad you liked it. So 
			why the long face, pallie?

					BASHIR 
			It's a long story.

					VIC 
			This wouldn't be about Dax's 
			baby, would it?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      23.

23   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(to Bashir) 
			What is he, a telepath?

					VIC 
			No, I'm a hologram.

					BASHIR
			A very smart hologram.

					VIC 
			It's simple. You take one 
			beautiful, happily married 
			filly... add the possibility of 
			her giving birth to a foal, and 
			what does it leave you?
				(not waiting for an
				answer)
			A couple of lovesick stallions
			that never got out of the
			starting gate.

					QUARK
				(to Bashir) 
			You have any idea what he's 
			talking about?

					VIC 
			I've got news for you two -- 
			it's time to move onto greener 
			pastures.

					BASHIR 
			It's not easy to lose a woman 
			like Dax.

					VIC 
			I hate to break it to you, 
			pallie, but you lost her a long 
			time ago. You both did.

	Vic allows the moment to sink in.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO     24.

23   CONTINUED:	(2)

					VIC 
			But lucky for you, space is big. 
			There are a lot of other nice 
			girls out there... with and 
			without spots. Capice?

	Bashir and Quark exchange a look.

					QUARK 
			That's it? That's supposed to 
			cheer us up?

					VIC 
			The truth shall set you free.

					QUARK
				(to Bashir)
			Do you feel better?

					BASHIR
				(surprised) 
			A little. How about you?

					QUARK 
			I guess.

	After a beat, they stand.

					VIC 
			Good. Because you were starting 
			to depress the band.

					BASHIR
			Thanks, Vic. We appreciate the 
			advice.

					QUARK
				(looking around the 
				room) 
			I like this place. I may have 
			to drop by more often.

					VIC
			Anytime, pallie, anytime.

	Bashir and Quark, their spirits lifted, EXIT. We 
	HOLD ON Vic watching them leave.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      25.

24   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Jake is seated across from his father at the dinner 
	table, taking a first bite of jambalaya. Jake 
	closes his eyes, savoring the flavors, then finally 
	swallows.

					SISKO 
			What do you think?

					JAKE
				(smiling) 
			I think the Romulans have agreed 
			to invade Cardassia.


					SISKO 
			How'd you know?

					JAKE 
			The jambalaya's perfect.
				(off Sisko's look) 
			When you're frustrated about 
			something you usually overcook 
			the rice.

					SISKO
			You never told me that before.

					JAKE 
			I'm telling you now. So when do 
			we leave?

					SISKO 
			We?

					JAKE 
			I'm a journalist, Dad. 
			Remember?

					SISKO
			Forget it, Jake. You're not

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      26.

24   CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			But, Dad -- we're talking about 
			the invasion of Cardassia. A 
			savage thrust into the very 
			heart of the Dominion. 
				(off Sisko's look) 
			That's not how I would write it.

					SISKO
			That's a relief, but you're 
			still not going.

					JAKE
			I have to go. It's my job. Now 
			if you don't want me on the 
			Defiant, fine. I'll go with 
			General Martok -- get the story
			from a Klingon perspective...

	Sisko takes a deep breath; he knows there's no way 
	he can stop Jake from going.

					SISKO
			All right. The Defiant it is.

					JAKE 
			So when do we leave?

					SISKO
			Just keep your bags packed.

					JAKE 
			Yes, sir.

	Jake gets up and heads for the door.

					SISKO
			Where are you going?

					JAKE
			To pack my bags.

					SISKO
			Do I have to remind you about 
			the need for strict security?

					JAKE 
			You just did.

					SISKO
			What about your dinner?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO     26A.

24   CONTINUED:	(2) 

	Jake comes back and takes the plate with him.

					JAKE
			It's delicious.

	Jake heads back to the door, taking a few bites.

24   CONTINUED:	(3) 

					SISKO
			Jake.

	Sisko catches up to his son. Puts his arm around 
	him and gives him a bear hug.

					JAKE
			Don't worry, Dad. We'll look
			out for each other. 

	And with that, Jake smiles and EXITS.

25   ANGLE ON SISKO (OPTICAL) 

	thoughtfully watching his son leave. Once the doors 
	have closed, Sisko turns away only to find himself --

26   INT. OPS (OPTICAL) 

	-- facing Worf. However, it clearly isn't Worf, but
	rather a wormhole ALIEN.

					WORF/ALIEN
			The Sisko is of Bajor.

27   INT. WARDROOM (OPTICAL)

	where another wormhole ALIEN waits for him, this 
	time in the guise of MARTOK ALIEN.

					MARTOK/ALIEN
			It is where he belongs.

28   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	where an Admiral Ross ALIEN is seated at Sisko's 
	desk.

					ROSS/ALIEN
			It is where he is meant to be.

					SISKO
			Are you telling me not to go to
			Cardassia?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT TWO      28.

29   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL) 

	Sisko again finds himself facing the Letant Alien.

					LETANT/ALIEN 
			You are the Sisko.

30   INT. OPS (OPTICAL)

	All four of the wormhole aliens are now present.

					ROSS/ALIEN 
			The Sisko is of Bajor.

					MARTOK/ALIEN 
			It is dangerous to walk a 
			different path.

					SISKO
			Dangerous? In what way?

					ROSS/ALIEN 
			The Sisko must not leave the 
			chosen path.

					WORF/ALIEN 
			The Sisko is of Bajor.

					LETANT/ALIEN 
			It is where he belongs.

					SISKO 
			But why is it dangerous for me 
			to leave? Does it have 
			something to do with Bajor? You 
			have to tell me --

	But the only answer Sisko gets is to find himself 
	back in --

31   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS 

	Alone. There's no sign of the wormhole aliens. And
	on his disquieted expression, we:

33   INT. WARDROOM

	CLOSE ON a map of the Chin'toka System. The map 
	displays a defensive grid of hundreds of O.W.P.s 
	surrounding the system's binary planets.

					ROSS (O.S.) 
			The Cardassians call them 
			orbital weapon platforms.

	PULL BACK to REVEAL Ross explaining the display to 
	Sisko, Martok and Letant. Clearly, Sisko has 
	something weighing heavily on his mind.

					ROSS 
			Intelligence reports indicate 
			that the Dominion is placing 
			hundreds of them throughout the 
			Chin'toka System.

					SISKO 
			Are they operational?

					ROSS 
			Not yet.

					MARTOK 
			How much time do we have before 
			they are?

					ROSS
			Two, maybe three days.

					LETANT 
				(to Sisko) 
			It would appear that your "weak

			stronger.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT THREE     30.

33   CONTINUED:

					MARTOK 
			Leave it to a Romulan to run at 
			the first sign of trouble.

					LETANT 
			And leave it to a Klingon to 
			leap to the wrong conclusion.
				(to Sisko) 
			The Romulan Empire has agreed to 
			join the invasion of Cardassia 
			and we live up to our 
			agreements. The question is: 
			can we launch an invasion before 
			their defensive grid is activated?

					MARTOK 
			We'll have to leave first thing 
			in the morning.

					ROSS
			Then it's settled. Good luck, 
			General.
				(a beat) 
			Good luck to us all.


	Martok and Levant head for the door.

					LETANT 
			Romulans don't believe in luck.

					MARTOK 
			All the better. That leaves 
			more for the rest of us.

	They EXIT, but Sisko hangs back with Admiral Ross. 
	Ross can see that something is on Sisko's mind.

					ROSS 
			You've been quiet, Ben. Those 
			weapon platforms have you 
			worried?

					SISKO 
			It's not that, sir.
				(a beat)
			It's about the Prophets -- the 
			wormhole aliens. They spoke to 
			me last night.

33   CONTINUED:	(2)

	This isn't a subject that Ross wants to see brought 
	up at the moment. But he values Sisko enough to 
	indulge him.

					ROSS 
			I hope they gave the mission 
			their blessing.

					SISKO
			They told me not to go to 
			Cardassia -- that I should stay 
			here.

					ROSS 
			Did they give a reason?

					SISKO
			Nothing concrete. Just that it 
			would be dangekous.

	Ross begins to lose his patience with this.

					ROSS 
			In what way? Dangerous to you? 
			To the mission? To Bajor?

					SISKO
			I'm not sure.

					ROSS
				(cutting to the
				chase)
			Then what are you telling me,
			Ben? You want permission to
			stay behind?

					SISKO
			It's not about what I want. 
			It's about what the Prophets 
			want.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: ""Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT THREE    32.

33   CONTINUED:	(3)

					ROSS 
			That's not a good enough answer. 
			Not from a Starfleet captain.

					SISKO
			The Prophets don't see me as a 
			Starfleet Captain -- they see me 
			as their Emissary.

					ROSS 
			That's the problem, isn't it? 
			For the past six years, you've 
			tried to be both. And up to 
			now, I've been patient... I've 
			indulged you... I've gone out 
			on a limb for you many times. 
			But this is it. You have to 
			make a decision. You're either 
			the Emissary or a Starfleet 
			captain -- you can't be both.

	Ross takes a breath, allowing Sisko to come to a 
	decision.

					SISKO 
			I'll be on the Bridge of the

	A surly Damar is being confronted by a wrathful 
	Weyoun.

					DAMAR
			A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine?

					WEYOUN 
			Composed of Federation, Klingon 
			and Romulan ships!

					DAMAR 
			You think they'll head for the

					WEYOUN 
			I would.

					DAMAR 
			Then we have nothing to worry

					WEYOUN 
			That's a very comforting

					DAMAR 
			I'll make sure it is.

					DUKAT (O.S.) 
			Gentlemen --

36   ANGLE ON THE DOOR 

	to see Dukat and two N.D. Jem'Hadar Guards ENTER. 
	Dukat carrys an ancient Bajoran box, about thirty 
	centimeters long, and a satchel, strapped across his 
	shoulder.

36   CONTINUED:

					DUKAT 
			I hope I'm not interrupting.

					WEYOUN
			What is it now, Dukat?

					DUKAT 
			I found it.

	Dukat shows them the box.

					DUKAT 
			Behold -- the key to victory.

	Weyoun looks skeptically at Dukat, who proceeds to 
	open the box. He takes out a wooden figurine of a 
	Bajoran Vedek. Weyoun and Damar exchange a look, 
	clearly unimpressed.

					DUKAT 
			I see you remain skeptical. You 
			won't for long.

	Dukat ceremoniously places the figurine in the 
	center of a nearby table. From the satchel, he 
	takes out a pair of Bajoran votive candies and 
	lights them.

					DUKAT 
			Over the last few months, I've 
			immersed myself in the study of 
			the Bajoran Ancient Texts. And 
			I've come to realize that the 
			wormhole is much more than just 
			a gateway to the Gamma Quadrant. 
			It's the Temple of the Prophets. 
			It's from there that they smile 
			benevolently down on Bajor. 
			It's from there that they 
			protect that world and its 
			people.
				(to Damar) 
			The sad truth is, we wasted our 
			time fighting the Bajorans when 
			we should've been fighting their 
			gods.

					DAMAR 
			How do you fight a god?

37   CLOSE ON DUKAT (OPTICAL) 

	as he takes the wooden figurine in both hands and 
	SNAPS it in two. An ENERGY VORTEX comes swirling 
	out of the bottom half of the statue and is absorbed 
	into Dukat's body, throwing him back against the 
	bulkhead.

38   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Weyoun and Damar are taken aback. But after a 
	beat, Damar recovers and rushes over to his old 
	mentor.

					DAMAR 
			Dukat --

39   ON DUKAT

	as his eyes pop open, revealing the blood-red eyes

					KIRA 
			Busy?

	Odo isn't sure how to respond; he's not sure why 
	Kira is there -- unless she's come to give him 
	another piece of her mind.

					ODO 
			A little.

	Kira walks over to his side of the desk and leans 
	over him.

					KIRA 
			I'll be leaving with the task 
			force first thing in the 
			morning.

					ODO
			I heard.

					KIRA
				(smiling)
			And... ?

	Kira waits for Odo to say something. Odo 
	misunderstands what she wants.

					ODO
				(agitated) 
			And I'm sorry I arrested him. I 
			was simply trying to do my duty, 
			but I can see how it might've 
			seemed excessive...

					KIRA
				(truly confused) 
			What are you talking about?

					ODO
			Vedek Solis. Isn't that why
			you're here?

					KIRA 
			No, but now I know why you've 
			been avoiding me these last few 
			days.

					ODO
			I haven't been avoiding you. 
			I've been helping you avoid me.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT THREE     37.

40   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA 
			Why would I want to do that?

					ODO
				(tentative) 
			Because... you don't want us to 
			be together anymore?

	The coin drops for Kira.

					KIRA 
			Is that what you've been 
			thinking? Odo -- we had an 
			argument. People have them all 
			the time. Look at Worf and Dax -- 
			they love each other and they 
			fight all the time.

					ODO
			Are you saying you love me?

					KIRA
			Don't try to change the subject.

					ODO
			Which is?

					KIRA 
				(smiling) 
			I don't even know anymore.

					ODO
			But you're no longer angry at 
			me?

					KIRA
			That's right. Though I still 
			think you were wrong to arrest 
			the Vedek.

	Odo doesn't quite follow her logic.

					ODO
			I see.

					KIRA 
			And I thought it'd be nice if we 
			spent my last night on the 
			station together.

					ODO
			That's a wonderful idea.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT THREE     38.

			Then I'll see you later.

					KIRA 
			Good.

					O'BRIEN 
			If you ask me, it's an ungodly

				(to Jake) 
			And you can quote me on that.

	Sisko, O'Brien and Jake enter the airlock. Kira 
	stops in front of Dax.

					DAX
			Give my best to the Jem'Hadar.

					KIRA
			I'll do that.
				(looking to Worf and
				Dax)
			I said a prayer for the two of
			you at the shrine last night.

					DAX
			About having a baby?

					KIRA
				(nodding)
			Sometimes the Prophets can be
			helpful in these matters.

					DAX
			I hope they were listening.

	Kira moves off into the airlock. As soon as she's 
	gone, Dax leans over and kisses Worf.

					DAX 
			You hear that? We have the

			I do not consider that "work."

	The moment has come for them to part.

					DAX 
			I wish I was going with you.

					WORF 
			You are.
				(tapping his chest) 
			In here.

					DAX 
			I love it when you get romantic.

	Worf takes her in his arms and kisses her

	Dax can't hide her joy at the news. Dax impetuously

	The warm moment hangs in the air for a beat, then 
	Dax nods, acknowledging Bashir's statement.

					DAX 
			I'd better get back to work...
				(a beat, smiling) 
			But first, I think I'll stop by 
			the Bajoran shrine.

					BASHIR 
			What for?

					DAX
				(with a twinkle) 
			Kira said a prayer for Worf and

					BASHIR 
			Then I'd say they were listening

					DAX
			I do today.

64   CLOSER (OPTICAL) 

	as the ORB LIGHT envelops the Dukat/Pah-wraith, he

	Almost immediately, the orb light BRIGHTENS in 
	intensity and then, just as suddenly, goes dark... 
	lifeless.

65   ANOTHER ANGLE 

	Dukat, free of the Pah-wraith, collapses to his

					O'BRIEN
				(to Sisko) 
			Sir, I found it. There's a

			Major, we're getting a priority-
			one transmission from Deep Space 
			Nine.
				(a beat)
			It's from Julian.

80   CLOSE ON KIRA

	to see her growing concern -- something tells her 
	the news isn't going to be good. And off this 
	moment, we go to --

81   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM (OPTICAL) 

	Weyoun and Damar are talking to the image of Dukat, 
	on a monitor. Dukat is on the Federation shuttle he 
	stole in "Waltz."

					WEYOUN
				(angry)
			This is a disaster! Federation
			soldiers have landed on
			Cardassian soil. And now you're
			telling me the wormhole is gone!

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     57.

81   CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN (Cont'd)
			And with it any chance of our
			getting reinforcements from the
			Gamma Quadrant.

					DUKAT 
			I'm well aware that things 
			didn't turn out quite the way 
			I'd planned, but I assure you 
			we've still achieved a great 
			victory.

					WEYOUN 
			Forgive me if I don't share your 
			euphoria.

					DUKAT 
			But you should. The Bajoran 
			people have been cut off from 
			their gods... perhaps forever.

					DAMAR 
			And how does that help us?

					DUKAT 
			Because Sisko's been cut off 
			from the Prophets as well. And 
			without the Prophets, he's just 
			another Starfleet captain.

					WEYOUN 
			And that's supposed to make me 
			feel better?

					DUKAT 
			Believe me, it will.

	And as Weyoun and Damar ponder Dukat's words --

									CUT TO:

82   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	The Defiant approaches the station.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     58.

83   INT. PROMENADE

	Worf and O'Brien grimly emerge from the airlock and 
	make a beeline for the Infirmary. Moments later, 
	they're followed by Sisko, Kira and Jake. Sisko 
	looks drawn, strained, as if a great burden weighs 
	heavily on his shoulders. The Promenade is filled 
	with solemn-looking Bajorans, most of whom are 
	gathered around the shrine. Upon seeing Sisko, 
	Sahgi, the Bajoran girl we saw earlier, rushes up to 
	him. Sisko, Jake and Kira stop, while Worf and 
	O'Brien continue into the Infirmary.

					SAHGI 
			Emissary! My mother says all 
			the orbs are dark -- that the 
			Prophets have abandoned us.
				(not waiting for a 
				response) 
			You have to find them, Emissary. 
			You have to ask them to come 
			back.

	Sisko doesn't know how to answer her.

					SISKO 
			I'll try.

	Satisfied, Sahgi runs back to her mother. Kira 
	manages to smile at the Emissary, though she is 
	clearly shaken by the loss of the Prophets. Sisko, 
	Jake and Kira head off toward the Infirmary --

84   INT. INFIRMARY 

	Sisko and Kira ENTER to find O'Brien with Odo and 
	Quark, waiting silently for word of Dax's condition.

	Looks are exchanged, but nothing's said. Nothing
	needs to be said. After a beat, Bashir emerges from 
	surgery. One look tells us all we need to know.

					BASHIR
				(to Sisko)
			I was able to save the Dax 
			symbiont, but we need to get it 
			back to Trill as soon as 
			possible.
				(a beat) 
			There was nothing I could do for 
			Jadzia.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE    58A.

84   CONTINUED:

	Bashir can see that Sisko isn't himself.

					BASHIR (Cont'd)
			Are you all right, Captain?

					SISKO
			I've been better...

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     59.

85   INT. SURGERY 

	Sisko ENTERS to see Worf standing by a bio-bed where 
	Jadzia clings to life.

85A  CLOSE ON WORF AND DAX

	sharing this final moment.

					DAX
			I'm sorry...

					WORF
			Save your strength.

	But Dax is determined to say something to him.

					DAX 
			Our baby... would've been so 
			beautiful.

	And with that, Dax exhales her last breath and dies. 
	Worf immediately lets out a bloodcurdling SCREAM of 
	pain and rage.

85B  ON SISKO

	as he and Worf exchange a long look of sorrow. 
	Worf looks back at Jadzia's body and begins to 
	recite a Klingon mourning CHANT:

					WORF
			neH taH Kronos. Hegh bat'lhqu 
			Hoch nej maH. neH taH Kronos. 
			yay je bat'lh manob Hegh.
			(Only Kronos endures. All we 
			can hope for is a glorious 
			death. Only Kronos endures. In 
			death there is victory and 
			honor.)

	And off this charged moment, we:

									DISSOLVE TO:

86   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE    59A.

87   INT. CARGO BAY 

	A long, sleek, jet-black coffin containing Jadzia's 
	body sits in the middle of the otherwise-empty Cargo 
	Bay. One of the Cargo Bay doors OPENS and Sisko 
	ENTERS. It's the next day and Sisko's grief is not 
	as raw anymore. He walks over to the casket and 
	stares down at it for a moment. When he speaks, 
	it's with gentle affection that covers a deep and 
	profound regret.

					SISKO 
			The funeral service is due to 
			begin in a few minutes, 
			Jadzia... but I need to talk to 
			you one last time.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     60.

87   CONTINUED:

	Sisko pauses to collect his thoughts.

					SISKO 
			When I first met you, you said 
			that my relationship with Jadzia 
			Dax wouldn't be any different 
			than the one I had with Curzon 
			Dax. But that's not the way 
			things worked out. I had a 
			helluva lot of fun with both of 
			you. But Curzon was my mentor. 
			You... you were my friend. And 
			I'm going to miss you.
				(a beat) 
			I should've listened to the Prophets 
			and not gone to Cardassia... maybe 
			then you'd still be alive.
				(a sudden flash of anger) 
			Why aren't you here, Jadzia? I 
			need you to help me sort things 
			out. Something's happened to 
			the Prophets... something that's 
			made them turn their backs on 
			Bajor, and I'm responsible. But 
			I don't know what to do about 
			it. How to make it right.
				(a beat) 
			I've failed as the Emissary and, 
			for the first time in my life, 
			I've failed in my duty as a 
			Starfleet officer.
				(a beat) 
			I need time to think... clear my 
			head. And I can't do it here. 
			Not on the station. Not now. I 
			have to get away... so I can 
			figure out a way to make things 
			right again.
				(a beat) 
			I have to make things right, 
			Jadzia. I have to.

	And off this anguished moment --

									CUT TO:

88   INT. OPS

	Kira, Odo, O'Brien, Bashir and Jake are gathered by 
	the stairs. The door to the captain's office OPENS 
	allowing Sisko, carrying a shoulder bag, to come 
	down the steps.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     61.

88   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			The station's all yours, major.

					KIRA
			She'll be here when you get
			back.

					BASHIR
			Sir, this leave of absence
			you're taking... how long do you
			think you'll be gone?

					SISKO
			I can't say exactly.

					ODO
			We'll be waiting.

					O'BRIEN
			Best of luck, sir.

					SISKO
			Thank you, Chief. My thanks to
			all of you.

	Sisko walks over to Jake.

					SISKO
			Let's go home, Jake.

89   NEW ANGLE

	as Sisko and Jake ENTER the Turbolift.

					SISKO
			Landing Pad "C."

	And with that, the Turbolift descends. HOLD ON the 
	faces of the group as they watch Sisko and Jake 
	disappear out of sight.

90   ANGLE ON KIRA

	as she turns and walks to the captain's office. 
	Curious, Odo follows after her.

91   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Kira and Odo ENTER and step over to the desk.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     62.

91   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			I was afraid of that. He's not 
			sure he's coming back.

					ODO
			What makes you say that?

92   NEW ANGLE

	to include Sisko's empty desk.

					KIRA 
			His baseball. He took it with 
			him.

93   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) 

	To see a shuttle take off from the station and begin 
	the long journey to Earth.

									DISSOLVE TO:

94   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 

	A warm, Louisiana evening. CAMERA SLOWLY DRIFTS 
	down the dark, empty alley. As we move, we begin to 
	HEAR the faint, rollicking SOUNDS of a New Orleans 
	JAZZ BAND coming from inside one of the buildings.

	As we continue to move, we begin to distinguish a 
	new sound: an intermittent CLANG of something 
	hitting a metal bowl.

	CAMERA COMES TO REST on Ben Sisko, dressed in a 
	cook's white T-shirt and pants, sitting on the back 
	steps of his father's restaurant, scrubbing the 
	shells of fresh clams and tossing them into a large, 
	metal bowl.

	Sisko seems calm and at peace, lulled by the simple, 
	repetitive actions of preparing the food.

					JAKE (O.S.)
			Dad...

95   NEW ANGLE

	to include Jake standing at the doorway.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tears of... " - REV. 04/28/98 - ACT FIVE     63.

95   CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			Grandpa's ready to close up the 
			restaurant. He wants to know 
			when you're coming in.

					SISKO
			In a little while...

	Jake nods and goes back inside. We HOLD ON Sisko as 
	he reaches for another clam and begins to scrub it 
	clean. And on that image, we:
