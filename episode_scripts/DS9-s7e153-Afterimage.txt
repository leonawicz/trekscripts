	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Establishing.

2    INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	CLOSE on EZRI DAX, who's standing at the rail 
	looking wistfully at the CROWD below.

					EZRI 
			It's funny... before yesterday, 
			I'd never set foot on this 
			station -- but it's as familiar 
			to me as the back of my hand.

	ADJUST to REVEAL --

3    MORN

	standing next to her.

					EZRI 
			Isn't that odd?

	Morn blinks uncomprehendingly.

					EZRI 
			You have no idea who I am, do 
			you?

	Morn shrugs.

					EZRI 
			I didn't think so.
				(mustering a smile)
			Thanks for listening anyway..

	Morn turns and heads off. Ezri sighs, moves away...

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        2.

4    INT. PROMENADE

	As Ezri takes in the sights, she walks with her 
	HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HER BACK the way Jadzia used 
	to.

	As she passes the Bajoran Temple, she stops. She 
	finds herself drawn to it, but at the same time 
	she's hesitant about going in. She comes to a 
	decision, EXITS through the doorway.

5    INT. BAJORAN TEMPLE

	as Ezri ENTERS the empty room and tentatively 
	approaches the alcove where the Orb is kept. 
	Standing near the spot where Jadzia was killed is a 
	strange sensation for her, and she's not sure what 
	to make of it.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        3.

6    KIRA

	ENTERS and crosses toward a SHRINE set up with lit 
	CANDLES. As she reaches for the ritual LIGHTER, 
	Ezri turns toward her and they recognize one other. 
	The two women stand there for a moment, not sure how 
	to deal with each other -- Ezri sees Kira as an old 
	friend, but Kira sees her as a relative stranger. 
	Finally, Ezri blurts out what's on her mind --

					EZRI 
			I was killed here.

	Kira is nonplussed by her sudden declaration --

					EZRI 
			I mean, Jadzia was.

	Kira reacts to this grim reminder of the friend she 
	lost, remembering her own role in what happened.

					KIRA
			I try not to think about that. 
			If I did, I'm not sure I could 
			come here.

					EZRI
				(looking down at the
				spot)
			It's a strange sensation. Dying.
			No matter how many times it
			happens to you, you never get
			used to it.

	It's odd to hear someone talk about dying, and 
	having no experience with it, Kira just listens 
	respectfully.

					EZRI 
			It must be a little disconcerting 
			for you -- knowing that I have 
			Jadzia's memories. 

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        4.

6    CONTINUED:

					EZRI (Cont'd)
				(sympathetic)
			No wonder you're uncomfortable.

	Kira can't deny that she is, but she wants Ezri to
	know that time might change things.

					KIRA
			It's a lot to get used to...

					EZRI
			Tell me about it.

	An awkward silence... not wanting to push things, 
	Ezri decides to leave...

					EZRI
			Well... I'll let you get to your
			prayers...

	Kira nods, and Ezri EXITS. Off Kira's face as she 
	tries to make sense of her feelings...

7    INT. QUARK'S

	A quiet afternoon. FERENGI WAITERS are preparing 
	for dinner and a few DABO GIRLS stand at the wheel 
	gossiping. QUARK is going over some PADDS at the 
	bar. Ezri approaches tentatively.

					EZRI
			How's my favorite Ferengi?

					QUARK
				(without looking up)
			That depends which Ferengi you're
			talking about.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        5.

7    CONTINUED:

					EZRI 
			I'm talking about you, Quark. 
			Who else would I be talking 
			about?

	Quark looks up and sees the young Trill officer 
	standing in front of him, quickly realizes it must 
	be the new Dax he's heard about.

					QUARK
			Dax.

					EZRI 
				(smiling) 
			Hi.

	Liking what he sees, Quark decides to be a little 
	more charming.

					QUARK 
			I was wondering when you were 
			going to drop by.

	They stand there, smiling and nodding like two 
	people at a high school reunion, not sure what to 
	say each other. Finally:

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        6.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK 
			I can't believe it's really you.

					EZRI 
			Me, neither.
				(off Quark's
				confused
				expression)
			I mean... of course I can believe
			I'm really "me" as in Ezri. It's
			just I haven't gotten used to the
			idea of "me" as in Dax.

	Quark tries not to let her confusion derail him.

					QUARK
			Well, whoever you are, let me buy 
			you a drink.

	He pours her a TANKARD of bloodwine. She picks it 
	up, takes a sniff.

					EZRI
				(unsure if she likes 
				it) 
			Bloodwine...

					QUARK 
			That's the good stuff -- same 
			vintage I served when you and 
			Worf got married.

					EZRI
			Smells awful...

					QUARK 
			It used to be your favorite.

					EZRI
				(handing over the 
				glass with her 
				right hand) 
			I used to be left-handed, too. A 
			lot of things have changed since 
			I was joined.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER       6A.

7    CONTINUED:	(3)

					QUARK 
			I can imagine. Seven lifetimes 
			worth of memories would mix 
			anybody up.
				(beat)
			Or is it eight?

					EZRI 
			Who knows anymore?

					QUARK
				(giving her
				something else to
				drink)
			It'll be easier once you get
			settled in. Have you picked out
			your quarters yet?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        7.

7    CONTINUED:	(4)

					EZRI 
			I'm not staying. I'm going back 
			to the Destiny to be assistant
			ship's counselor.

					QUARK 
			You're a therapist?

					EZRI 
			Why does everyone sound so 
			surprised when they hear that?

					QUARK
			It's just...
				(reaching) 
			You're so young.

	Ezri looks unconvinced --

					QUARK 
			Why are you in such a hurry to 
			leave, anyway? Why not stay for 
			a while, get to know your old 
			friends again.

	Part of Ezri wants to, but...

					EZRI 
			I don't want to force things. 
			People need time to get over 
			losing Jadzia.

					QUARK 
			I started getting over her the 
			minute you walked in. No 
			offense.

					EZRI 
			None taken.
				(beat) 
			I think.

	She studies him for a beat.

					EZRI 
			You know something, Quark. 
			Besides Benjamin, you're the only 
			one of Jadzia's friends who 
			doesn't seem uncomfortable around 
			me.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        8.

7    CONTINUED:	(5)

					QUARK 
			She and I were close, I don't see 
			any reason why we shouldn't be 
			close, too.

	Ezri is oblivious to Quark's continued attempts to 
	charm her --

					QUARK 
			Remember all those late night 
			tongo games?

					EZRI 
			Who could forget?
				(realizing) 
			Wait a minute... you owe me ten 
			slips of latinum from our last 
			game.

	Quark wishes he hadn't brought it up.

					QUARK 
			I don't think so.

					EZRI 
			I won with a Full Consortium. I 
			remember.

					QUARK 
			Your memory must be playing 
			tricks on you.

					EZRI 
			Don't say that, Quark. I'm 
			confused enough as it is.

					QUARK
				(distracting her) 
			Look who's here!


	He motions to someone off-screen --

8    NEW ANGLE

	to include WORF, who's just ENTERED the bar and is 
	standing in the doorway.

					QUARK
			I bet you two have a lot to talk 
			about.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - TEASER        9.

8    CONTINUED:

	This is the first time Ezri's seen Worf since Jadzia 
	died. She smiles tentatively, but as soon as Worf 
	sees her, he stiffens, turns away, and EXITS.

					QUARK
			Maybe not...

	Off Ezri's face as she tries to make sense of Worf's 
	reaction...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	where SISKO, absorbed in something he's reading off 
	a PADD, is crossing behind his desk. The door 
	CHIMES.

					SISKO
			Come in.

	When the door doesn't open, he turns to look. 
	Strangely, there's no one standing outside in Ops. 
	He moves toward the sliding glass doors to 
	investigate.

	Another CHIME, and Sisko realizes it's coming from 
	the other door to his office, the one he rarely 
	uses. Puzzled, he moves toward it, works the PANEL, 
	and OPENS it to reveal Ezri in the corridor.

					SISKO
				(surprised)
			Dax...

	She peers past him to make sure no one's there with 
	him.

					EZRI
			Are you alone?

					SISKO
				(gesturing her in)
			Why are you sneaking in this way?

					EZRI
			I didn't want to go through Ops,
			in case Worf was there.

	Dejected by her predicament, Ezri comes inside, 
	making sure to stay clear of the glass doors to Ops.

					EZRI
				(continuing)
			We bumped into each other last
			night in Quark's.

					SISKO
			It didn't go well, I take it?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE      11.

9    CONTINUED:

	Ezri shakes her head.

					SISKO
				(gently) 
			You weren't expecting him to 
			accept you right away, were you?

					EZRI 
			Of course not. But he wouldn't 
			even talk to me.

	Sisko realizes it went worse than he thought, 
	wonders if there might be a simple explanation.

					SISKO 
			Maybe he's just trying to respect 
			your customs -- he knows that 
			joined Trill aren't supposed to 
			get involved with the people 
			their previous hosts were married 
			to.

					EZRI 
			That doesn't mean we can't talk
			to each other. Worf knows that.

					SISKO 
			Are you sure?

					EZRI
			I told him all about Trill 
			traditions -- Jadzia did. We 
			discussed them.
				(frustrated with the
				pronoun confusion)
			They discussed them.

					SISKO
				(it's okay) 
			I understand.

					EZRI
				(shaking her head) 
			These pronouns are driving me 
			crazy.

	Ezri cautiously leans over so she can peek out 
	through the glass doors into Ops. In the 
	background, we can see Worf at his post.

					EZRI 
			Look at him, Benjamin. He's in 
			pain.

	Sisko peeks out and studies the impassive Klingon.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE 11A-13.     

9    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO 
			How can you tell?

					EZRI 
			I was his wife. I can tell.

	Ezri moves away from the door and settles heavily on 
	the couch.

					EZRI 
			I don't want to put him through 
			any more heartache than he's 
			already going through. It's a 
			good thing I'm going back to the 
			Destiny.

					SISKO
				(wishing it weren't 
				true) 
			So you're still planning on 
			leaving?

					EZRI 
			I can't stay. I couldn't do that 
			to him. Besides, I think it 
			might be easier for me on the 
			Destiny. There are too many 
			memories here...

	As much as he doesn't want to face the fact that 
	she's leaving, Sisko has to accept it.

					SISKO 
			I'm going to miss you, old man.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE      14.

9    CONTINUED:	(3)

					EZRI
			I'm going to miss you too,
			Benjamin.

	Off the moment between the two old friends...

10   INT. QUARK'S

	where ODO, BASHIR and O'BRIEN are sitting with 
	GARAK. Garak is busy working a CARDASSIAN PADD, not 
	really paying attention to the conversation.

					BASHIR 
				(to O'Brien)
			-- no, I'm going to be Travis.
			You're Crockett.

					ODO
			And who am I going to be again?

					BASHIR
			General Santa Anna.
				(to Garak)
			When can our costumes be ready?

	Garak is so intent on his work he doesn't hear 
	Bashir.

					BASHIR
			Garak?

					GARAK
			Hmm?

					BASHIR
			Our holosuite costumes -- when
			can they be ready?

					GARAK
			I'm afraid you're going to have
			to get them from somewhere else.

	THREE STARFLEET OFFICERS approach a nearby table to 
	talk to their friends -- they end up standing right 
	behind Garak's chair, crowding the space between 
	tables.

					GARAK
			My shop's closed.

					O'BRIEN
			Still?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE     14A.

10   CONTINUED:

					GARAK 
			Starfleet Intelligence is keeping 
			me quite busy these days.

					BASHIR 
			What if we let you be Crockett?

					O'BRIEN
				(objecting) 
			Hey.

	Garak glances at the people looming behind him, 
	scoots his chair in a little.

					GARAK 
			Even if I was interested, I don't 
			have the time. Do you have any 
			idea how long it takes to decode 
			a Cardassian military 
			transmission? I invented some of 
			the basic encryption protocols 
			when I was with the Obsidian 
			Order, and it still takes me days 
			to decipher a simple sentence.

					BASHIR
			You've got to take a break sometime.

					GARAK
			I intend to. As soon as the 
			Dominion has been driven off 
			Cardassia.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE      15.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK (Cont'd)
				(turning suddenly to 
				the people behind 
				him)
			Must you stand so close?

	It comes out a little sharper than Garak seemed to 
	have meant it too, and Bashir, O'Brien and Odo 
	aren't sure what to make of it.

	The three officers Garak snapped at are a bit taken 
	aback, but they comply and move out of the way.

					BASHIR
			That was a little harsh.

					GARAK
			I don't like people looming over
			me.
				(standing)
			I have to get back to work.
				(all smiles again)
			Thank you for your company,
			gentlemen.

	And with that, Garak takes his leave. Odo watches 
	him go, and Bashir and O'Brien exchange "what was 
	that all about?" looks. Off this moment...

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE 16-17.      

13   INT. GARAK'S SHOP (VPB)

	We can see that the shop has been closed for some 
	time. The MANNEQUINS are BARE, and any CLOTHES in 
	the racks are wrapped and bound. Several WORK 
	CONSOLES have been set up in the room.

	Garak is sitting at a console, trying to decode a 
	Cardassian transmission. He seems to be having 
	trouble concentrating, and we might notice a SHEEN 
	OF SWEAT on his forehead. As he works the console, 
	we see some of the CARDASSIAN SYMBOLS change and 
	regroup into Cardassian LETTERS.

	As he studies the monitor, he tugs at his collar as 
	if it's too tight. He touches his forehead and is 
	alarmed to see how damp it is. Trying to fight back 
	a mounting sense of panic, his BREATHING starts to 
	become shallow and labored. We hear a faint 
	rhythmic SOUND that starts to build as the scene 
	progresses -- Garak's HEARTBEAT. Behind him, Odo 
	ENTERS, carrying a STARFLEET PADD.

13A NEW ANGLE - GARAK'S POV

	We see Odo's mouth move, but we can't hear anything 
	except the SOUND of Garak's breathing.

					ODO
				(mouth silently moving)
			Starfleet intercepted another
			Cardassian military transmission.

	Garak stares at him -- we hear the SOUND of his 
	BREATHING, the quickening of his HEARTBEAT.

					ODO
				(mouth silently moving)
			Are you all right?

	Garak panics, starts to hyperventilate -- as he 
	falls to the floor, we cut to --

13B  NEW ANGLE

					ODO
				(audible now)
			Garak!

					GARAK
				(gasping for breath)
			Can't... breathe...

			Odo to Infirmary -- we have a

	Off this moment, we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

14   INT. INFIRMARY

	Bashir is using a MEDICAL TRICORDER to scan Garak, 
	who's sitting on a BIO-BED. Sisko and Odo look on.

					ODO
				(to Sisko) 
			He had a claustrophobic attack in 
			his shop...

					SISKO
			His shop?
				(to Garak) 
			I don't understand. That's a 
			good sized space.

					GARAK
				(still shaken) 
			I know.
				(trying to make
				sense of it)
			I've been claustrophobic for as
			long as I can remember, but
			lately it seems to have gotten
			worse. Rooms that I once found
			completely tolerable suddenly
			feel alarmingly cramped.

	As he says this, he glances around the Infirmary, as 
	if it too were starting to feel too close for 
	comfort.

					BASHIR
				(closing tricorder) 
			I wish I had an explanation, but 
			I don't. He checks out fine.

					GARAK
				(annoyed)
			Well, I don't feel fine.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      20.

14   CONTINUED:

					GARAK (Cont'd)
				(getting off the bio-bed)
			Would you gentlemen mind terribly
			if we continued this conversation
			on the Promenade?

	Sisko and the others exchange looks, and the captain 
	gestures that they should file out.

15   INT. PROMENADE

	as Sisko, Bashir, Odo and Garak step outside. He 
	takes a breath, seems to relax a little in the 
	larger space.

					ODO
			Better?

					GARAK 
			A little.

					SISKO
			Mister Garak, as much as I 
			sympathize with your situation, 
			I'm not sure why you asked to see 
			me.

					GARAK 
			I was hoping you'd be kind enough 
			to express my regrets to 
			Starfleet Intelligence. When I 
			get like this, my concentration 
			isn't what it should be. I'm 
			afraid I'm not going to be up to 
			decoding transmissions for a 
			while.

	Sisko frowns... this is not good news.

					SISKO 
			Can I let them know when you 
			might be back on the job?

					GARAK 
			I wish I could say.
				(off Sisko's disappointment) 
			Believe me, captain, I'm not 
			happy about it either. I want to 
			see this war end as much as you 
			do.

	Sisko acknowledges with a nod.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO     20A.

15   CONTINUED:

					GARAK 
			Now if you'll excuse me, I'm 
			going to go hem some pants.
				(off their puzzled
				looks)
			For some reason, sewing seems to
			calm me down.

	Sisko and the others watch as Garak moves away.

					ODO
				(puzzled) 
			Sewing?

					SISKO
				(to Bashir) 
			We can't afford to lose Garak 
			right now. Is there anything you 
			can do for him?

					BASHIR 
			To be blunt, our friend Garak 
			needs to have his head examined.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      21.

15   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Off Sisko's reaction, we cut to --

16   INT. GUEST QUARTERS - CLOSE - EZRI

	Her face UPSIDE DOWN in FRAME.

					EZRI 
			Me? You want me to work with 
			Garak?

17   ADJUST TO REVEAL

	Sisko crouched next to Ezri, who's standing on her 
	head, her legs propped against the wall.

					SISKO
			You're a counselor, aren't you?

					EZRI 
			Assistant counselor. I'm still 
			in training.

					SISKO
			Come on, Dax. What are you going 
			to learn in the next few months 
			that you haven't already learned 
			in the last three hundred years?

					EZRI 
			How to keep from breaking into 
			tears for no reason; how to 
			resist the urge to stand on my 
			head -- things like that.

					SISKO 
			Why are you standing on your 
			head?

					EZRI 
			Emony used to do it.

					SISKO
			The gymnast?

					EZRI 
			She found it relaxing.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      22.

17   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			Do you?

					EZRI 
			Actually, it's giving me a 
			headache.

	She lets her legs fall to the ground and gets into a 
	sitting position. She and Sisko continue their talk 
	sitting on the floor.

					EZRI 
			What about Julian, can't he work 
			with Garak?

					SISKO
			Julian's a good physician, but 
			he's not a counselor --
				(before she can 
				point it out) 
			-- or even an assistant
			counselor. And besides, he 
			doesn't have eight lifetimes of 
			experience under his belt.

					EZRI 
			I bet he doesn't stand on his 
			head for no reason, either.

					SISKO
			You can do this, old man. I know 
			you can.

					EZRI
				(giving in) 
			All right. I'll try. I just 
			wish I had as much confidence in 
			me as you do.

	Off this moment...

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      23.

18   INT. QUARK'S

	as Quark sidles up to Bashir at the bar. 
	SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.

					QUARK
			So what do you think?

					BASHIR
			About what?

					QUARK
			About her.

					BASHIR
				(getting exasperated)
			Who?

					QUARK
			Dax.

					BASHIR
			Ezri? She seems... nice.

					QUARK
			Meaning what?

					BASHIR
			Meaning... nice.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      24.

18   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			Come on, Doctor. I know the way
			you felt about Jadzia.

					BASHIR
			She's not Jadzia.

						QUARK
			She's the next best thing.
				(beat)
			So are you interested?

					BASHIR
			Sounds to me like you're the one
			who's interested.

					QUARK
			It's not every day you get a
			second chance with a woman.

					BASHIR
			She's not the same woman.

					QUARK
			She's still Dax, isn't she?

					BASHIR
			More or less.

					QUARK
			That's good enough for me.
				(beat)
			Ready for a little competition?

					BASHIR
			You're insane.

					QUARK
			And you... are going to lose.

	And with that, Quark moves off, leaving Bashir with 
	his own thoughts...

19   INT. GARAK'S SHOP

	Garak has pushed the computer consoles he was 
	working with aside in order to make way for a sewing 
	TABLE. The shop is still closed, but he's pulled 
	out unfinished work to do, and we find him using a 
	handheld DEVICE to work on a pair of women's PANTS. 
	He seems much calmer now, just like he said he'd be. 
	The door OPENS and Ezri ENTERS.

					EZRI
			Am I interrupting?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      25.

19   CONTINUED:

					GARAK
				(waving her in) 
			You must be Ezri Dax. The 
			captain told me you'd be dropping 
			by to... "counsel" me.

					EZRI 
			Is that all right?

	In truth, it's Garak's intention to get her out of 
	there as quickly as possible, though he intends to 
	be polite about it.

					GARAK 
			That depends on what's involved. 
			You see, I'm a very private 
			person.

					EZRI 
			I understand. So is it helping?

	Garak isn't sure what she's talking about --

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      26.

19   CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI
				(off his look) 
			The sewing. Is it making you 
			feel better?

	Garak decides to use this as an opening to start 
	getting her out of there.

					GARAK
			Thankfully, yes. In fact --

					EZRI
				(before he can 
				continue) 
			You're lucky, nothing helps me.

	Garak just can't seem to get enough of a bead on her 
	to implement a polite eviction.

					GARAK 
			Are you claustrophobic, too?

					EZRI 
			What makes you say that?

					GARAK 
			You just said --

					EZRI
				(realizing the 
				misunderstanding) 
			No, I get spacesick. Ever since 
			I was joined. I'm very sensitive 
			to motion. I can even feel the 
			station spinning.

					GARAK
				(amazed) 
			Really?


					EZRI
				(nods) 
			It's because of what happened to 
			Torias. He died in a shuttle 
			accident.

					GARAK
				(confused) 
			Why would that make you 
			spacesick?

					EZRI 
			Because I blame myself for what 
			happened.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO     26A.

19   CONTINUED:	(3)

					GARAK 
			You were piloting?

					EZRI 
			Yes. No. Depends on how you 
			look at it. Torias was my fifth 
			host. Didn't I say that?

					GARAK 
			No.

					EZRI 
			Well, he was. And I think the 
			reason his death has stayed with 
			me for so long is that I just 
			can't seem to forgive him for 
			getting himself killed.

					GARAK 
			But you said it was an accident. 
			If he wasn't to blame, then 
			you're not to blame, either.

					EZRI 
			I know. But somehow I can't help 
			punishing myself for it.

					GARAK
				(seeing if he follows) 
			By getting spacesick.

					EZRI 
			Exactly.

	We can see that Garak is starting to feel 
	comfortable around her -- he's responding to the way 
	she's able to connect with his experiences by 
	drawing on things that happened in her many 
	lifetimes.

					GARAK 
			Don't take this the wrong way, 
			but it sounds to me like you're 
			the one that needs to see a 
			counselor.

					EZRI 
			You're probably right. But I 
			didn't come here to talk about my 
			problems.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      27.

19   CONTINUED:	(4)

					EZRI (Cont'd)
			Do you remember anything
			traumatic happening to you when
			you were young -- something that
			involved getting trapped in a
			confined space.

					GARAK 
			If I'd been that careless, my 
			father would've left me there to 
			teach me a lesson.

					EZRI
			Sounds like he was strict.

					GARAK 
			He didn't get to be the head of 
			the Obsidian Order without a 
			sense of... discipline.

					EZRI
			Did he discipline you?

					GARAK 
			He'd punish me when I misbehaved. 
			What father wouldn't?

	Ezri files Garak's response away and presses on --

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO 27A-28.     

19   CONTINUED:	(5)

					EZRI 
			Did your mother approve of his 
			punishments?

					GARAK 
			Not that it mattered. She didn't 
			have a key to the closet.

					EZRI 
			The closet?

					GARAK
				(matter of fact) 
			My father used to lock me in when 
			I misbehaved.


					EZRI
				(why didn't you tell
				me?)
			Garak, I asked you if you'd ever
			been trapped in a confined space
			when you were young.

					GARAK 
			I wasn't trapped. I knew he'd 
			let me out when I learned my 
			lesson.

	We may start to notice Garak beginning to exhibit 
	the first signs of an incipient claustrophobic 
	attack -- despite his matter-of-fact tone, all this 
	talk of being locked in a closet is getting to him.

					EZRI
				(incredulous) 
			Learned your lesson?

					GARAK
				(tugging at his 
				collar) 
			I could be very stubborn.


					EZRI 
			That's not the point. Nothing a 
			child could do justifies locking 
			him in a closet.

	Garak isn't sure if he accepts that -- after all, 
	it's how he was raised.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO     28A.


19   CONTINUED:	(6)

					EZRI 
			No wonder you get claustrophobic. 
			It's just like me getting 
			spacesick. We're both punishing 
			ourselves for things that weren't 
			our fault.

	Garak considers what she's saying for a long beat...

					GARAK 
			Are you saying that if I can stop 
			blaming myself, my claustrophobia 
			will just disappear?

					EZRI 
			Not overnight, but letting go of 
			all this misplaced guilt would be 
			a good start.

	Garak takes this in, decides to take it under 
	advisement.

					GARAK
				(dabbing his 
				forehead) 
			Well, I'll certainly give your 
			advice some thought.

					EZRI
				(noticing his face) 
			Are you all right?

					GARAK 
			To tell you the truth, I'm 
			starting to feel a little 
			claustrophobic.

					EZRI 
			Probably because we've been 
			talking about it.
				(steadying herself) 
			Actually, I'm starting to feel a 
			little spacesick myself.

					GARAK 
			If you don't mind, I think I'll 
			get back to my sewing.

					EZRI 
			Good idea.

					GARAK
				(picking up his 
				seamer) 
			Thank you for coming by.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      29.

19   CONTINUED:	(7)

					EZRI
				(dizzy)
			My pleasure...

	She heads for the door, weaving a little as she 
	walks. Garak looks up from his work for a beat, 
	then gets back to it. Off this moment...

	she bumps smack into --

22   WORF

	their eyes lock, a thousand things they have to say 
	to each other going through their heads. Finally...

					EZRI
				(softly)
			Hello, Worf.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT TWO      30.

22   CONTINUED:

	The sound of her voice snaps him out of it. 

					WORF 
			Ensign.

	With a curt nod, he starts to move past her.

					EZRI 
			Ensign? That's all you have to 
			say to me?

					WORF
			What more is there to say?

					EZRI
				(incredulous) 
			I was your wife.

					WORF
				(hard) 
			You are not Jadzia. She died and 
			went to Sto-vo-kor. I do not 
			know you, nor do I wish to.

	And with that, he moves away, leaving Ezri stunned 
	and shattered. Off this moment, we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

23   INT. GUEST QUARTERS

	Ezri is standing at the window looking out at the 
	stars, trying to decide if the station's spinning is 
	still making her spacesick. A CHIME at the door.

					EZRI
				(without turning) 
			Come in.

	The door OPENS to reveal Sisko. He studies Ezri for 
	a beat.

					SISKO 
			Dax... ?

					EZRI 
			Do you think the chief could 
			adjust the inertial dampers so 
			the station would spin a little 
			slower?

					SISKO
			I don't know. Why?

					EZRI 
			Never mind.
				(turning to him) 
			To what do I owe the pleasure?

					SISKO
			I'm not going to say I told you 
			so, but Garak dropped by Odo's 
			office this morning. He wanted 
			to pick up the latest Cardassian 
			transmissions for decoding.

					EZRI
				(surprised) 
			Really?

					SISKO
			Looks like his claustrophobia is 
			under control.

					EZRI
				(can't quite believe it) 
			I guess our talk must've 
			helped...

					SISKO
			Told you so.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT THREE    31A.

23   CONTINUED:

					EZRI 
			I thought you said you weren't 
			going to say that.

					SISKO 
			Couldn't resist.

	Ezri smiles, but Sisko can see that something's 
	still troubling her.

					SISKO 
			You all right?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT THREE     32.

23   CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI 
			I talked with Worf.

					SISKO
			How'd it go?

					EZRI 
			He doesn't want to have anything 
			to do with me.

	Sisko takes this in for a beat...

					SISKO
			Maybe I should have a talk with 
			him.

					EZRI 
			Absolutely not. You intimidate 
			him.

					SISKO
			Me?

					EZRI 
			Don't tell him I told you.

					SISKO
				(trying to get used 
				to the idea) 
			I intimidate Worf.

					EZRI 
			You like that, don't you?

					SISKO
			Of course not.

					EZRI 
			Come on. I've been a man, I 
			know.

	Sisko isn't about to admit anything, tries to get 
	back on track.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT THREE     33.

23   CONTINUED:	(3)

					SISKO 
			Look, we're not talking about me 
			and Worf, we're talking about you 
			and Worf. Now, I sympathize with 
			what he's going through, but as 
			far as I'm concerned, you have as 
			much right to be here as he does.

					EZRI
				(sensing he's taking
				this somewhere)
			What are you getting at,
			Benjamin?

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT THREE 34-35.     

23   CONTINUED:	(4)

					SISKO
			This war hasn't been good for 
			morale around here. I've been 
			thinking the station could use a 
			counselor. I can't think of 
			anyone better suited for the job.

					EZRI
				(touched) 
			Thanks for saying that. But even 
			if Worf wasn't an issue, I'm 
			still just an assistant 
			counselor.

					SISKO
			I took the liberty of contacting 
			Starfleet Medical. They're 
			willing to waive the rest of your 
			training and give you a 
			commission as a full counselor 
			with the rank of lieutenant.

					EZRI
				(amazed) 
			How'd you talk them into that?

					SISKO
			I asked them what they thought 
			you were going to learn in the 
			next few months --

					EZRI
				(finishing for him) 
			That I haven't already learned in 
			the last three hundred years.

					SISKO
			They saw my point. I wish you 
			would, too.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT THREE     36.

23   CONTINUED:	(5)

					EZRI 
			Benjamin, it means a lot to know

			can't.

					SISKO 
			Because of Worf...

					EZRI 
			Mostly.

					SISKO 
			Just say the word, and I'll go 
			intimidate him for you.

					EZRI 
			You'd like that, wouldn't you?

	Off their shared smile...

			So... here we are.

	They regard each other for a beat, and Ezri catches

					EZRI
			What was that?

					BASHIR
			What was what?

					EZRI
			That look.

					BASHIR
				(unsure if he should

			This might be the last thing you

				(off her discomfort)
			I shouldn't have said anything.

					EZRI
			Don't flirt with me, Julian.
			Please.

					BASHIR
			I'm not.

					EZRI
			I remember the way you used to
			flirt with Jadzia.

					BASHIR
				(innocent indignation)
			It was just an observation.

					EZRI
			Good. Because I'm not like her.
			She knew how to handle it.
				(come to think of

			In fact, she enjoyed it.

	As they head off...

26B  INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	as Bashir and Ezri arrive at the mouth of the 
	airlock, where TWO DEPUTIES are standing watch.

	They look inside the airlock and are stunned to see 
	Garak at the airlock door, frantically trying to 
	roll it open so he can get out into the OPEN SPACE 
	beyond.

					GARAK
			Open it! Let me out!

	He pounds on the airlock control panel, exasperated 
	that he doesn't know the access code.

26C  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	From outside the airlock door, we can see the panic 
	and desperation in Garak's face as he peers out at

30A  EXT. HOLOSUITE CLIFF - DAY (OPTICAL)

	Ezri and Garak are sitting on a LEDGE overlooking an 
	alien OCEAN. A slight BREEZE whips up occasionally 
	around them; we can hear the distant SOUND of waves 
	crashing against the shore.

	She's brought him here to calm him down, and while 
	he's no longer panicked, he's still shaken from his 
	experience. When we cut in, she's leading him 
	through some breathing exercises.

					EZRI
				(inhaling) 
			Breathe in...

	He takes a deep breath...

					EZRI
				(exhaling) 
			And out.
				(repeating the 
				process) 
			In... and out.
				(a beat) 
			Better?

	He nods slightly, but we can see that he's still 
	rattled.

					EZRI
				(trying to get him
				to take in the
				view)
			Beautiful, isn't it? Look at
			that sky. It just goes on and
			on.

					GARAK 
			No, it doesn't. It's an 
			illusion. There's a holosuite 
			wall not ten meters in front of
			us.

					EZRI 
			But you can't see it.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FOUR      41.

30A  CONTINUED:

					GARAK 
			I can feel it.

					EZRI 
			We could call up another program.

					GARAK
				(angry with himself) 
			I can't believe the way I 
			humiliated myself back there.
				(trying to make 
				sense of what he 
				did) 
			I just wanted to... get out. 
			I couldn't breathe.

					EZRI
				(wry) 
			If you were looking for fresh 
			air, you were knocking on the 
			wrong door.

					GARAK
				(trying to rally 
				himself) 
			I have to get this situation 
			under control. If I don't, I'm 
			going to be forced to leave the 
			station.
				(panic rising) 
			Where would I go? I can't go 
			back to Cardassia... I doubt I'd 
			be welcome on Bajor...

	Ezri can see that he's in danger of getting himself 
	worked up again --

					EZRI 
			You're not going to have to leave 
			the station. I'll talk to Quark 
			and tell him to make this 
			holosuite available to you twenty-
			six hours a day. 

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FOUR      42.

					EZRI (Cont'd)
			Whenever you feel like walking

			come here instead.

	Garak nods, taking some comfort in having an escape
	valve.

					EZRI
			It's going to be all right
			we're going to get this under
			control. I promise.

	A quiet moment as they look out at the water...

					GARAK 
			If you don't mind, I'd like to 
			sit here and be alone for a 
			while.

					EZRI 
			I'll check in on you later.

	Garak nods, and Ezri puts a comforting hand to his 
	shoulder. She stands, EXITING the frame as she 
	starts back across the ledge. We HOLD on Garak 
	until we hear the SOUND of the holosuite door 
	opening and closing.

32   INT. INFIRMARY

	Bashir is using some TWEEZERS to try to get 
	something out of Quark's ear. It's clearly a 
	delicate procedure, and Quark is bracing for some 
	pain.

					QUARK
			Ow!

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FOUR      43.

32   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			Hold still.
				(probing)
			I think I've got something.

	Bashir pulls the tweezers out and is surprised to 
	see that he's retrieved a small FEATHER.

					QUARK
				(frowns)
			I knew it. Never get a Tympanic
			Tickle from an amateur.

					BASHIR
			Tympanic Tickle... ?
				(before Quark can

			Never mind. I don't want to

				(crossing away)
			Sit tight. I'm going to get you

	Bashir crosses into the other room, over to the 
	dispensing closet. As he starts searching the 
	bottles, a HAND claps down on his shoulder. ADJUST 
	to REVEAL --

33   WORF

	standing at his side.

					WORF
			We need to talk.

					BASHIR
			About what?

	Worf pushes Bashir up against the wall.

					WORF
			Do not toy with me, Doctor. I
			know how you felt about Jadzia.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FOUR      44.

33   CONTINUED:


					BASHIR
			Worf, that was a long time ago.

					WORF
				(anger rising)
			I saw you with her.

					BASHIR
				(confused)
			With Jadzia?

					WORF
			You know who I'm talking about.

					BASHIR
			You've got it all wrong.

					WORF
			Stay away from her.

					BASHIR
				(indignant)
			Now wait just a minute.

	Bashir tries to free himself from Worf's grip so 
	that he can continue, but he can't do it. He 
	decides to continue anyway.

					BASHIR
			You have no right to tell me who
			I can be friends with.

					WORF
			If you dishonor Jadzia's memory,
			you will regret it.

	His point made, Worf heads for the door. When he 
	sees Quark peeking in from the other room.

					WORF
			That goes for you too, Ferengi.

	And with that, Worf EXITS.

			Why would you want to pay me for

	Quark catches sight of a figure in his peripheral

	window to the Promenade.

					QUARK
				(thinking it's Worf) 
			Ah.
				(realizing it's not) 
			Oh.

	Ezri's too busy to ask what his problem is.

					EZRI 
			Can I have a cup of coffee,

					QUARK 
			He's gone. He left about an hour

					EZRI

			Where'd he go?

	He turns to look at her and we can see that he's 
	clearly agitated, but not in the way we've seen when 
	he's feeling claustrophobic -- he's angry, 
	frustrated and fed up.

	He grabs his SEAMER and starts to flatten the torn 
	dress on his work table.

					EZRI 
			I thought you were going to stay 
			in the holosuite for a while.

					GARAK 
			I got tired of looking at a fake 
			landscape and pretending I was 
			outside. Work is the answer. 
			My father always used to say that 
			a person should throw themselves 
			into their work.
				(sewing frantically) 
			Do your chores, Elim. I told you 
			to do your chores.

					EZRI
				(sensing an opening) 
			And if you didn't? What would he 
			do to you?

					GARAK 
			Oh, no. Don't start. Spare me 
			your insipid psychobabble. I'm

			feels sorry for himself because 
			his daddy wasn't nice to him.
				(a beat; pointed) 
			You couldn't begin to understand

	Ezri tries not to be thrown by Garak's sudden attack 
	on her -- she knows patients sometimes direct 
	misplaced anger at their therapists.

					EZRI 
			I'd like to try.

	Garak tosses his work aside and approaches her, his 
	anger rising.

					GARAK 
			I'm sure you would. You'd like 
			nothing more than to pry into my

			Well, I'm not interested in

			someone to come in here and hold
			my hand, I need someone who can
			help me get back to work. And
			you, my dear, aren't up to the
			task.

	Ezri's stung... he's speaking to her greatest fears.

					GARAK
			Look at you. You're pathetic.
			A confused child trying to live
			up to the legacy left by her
			predecessors. You're not worthy
			of the name Dax. I knew Jadzia --
			she was vital -- alive. She
			owned herself. But you -- you
			don't even know who you are.
				(in her face)
			How dare you presume to help me?
			You can't even help yourself.

	Ezri has no answers for his withering criticisms.

					GARAK
				(calm)
			Now, get out of here. Before I

			What does it look like? I'm

					SISKO
			Why?

			Because I can't do my job. 
			Garak's right -- how can I help

					SISKO
			I know this has been a hard time

					EZRI
				(cutting him off) 
			Don't call me that! I'm not the

			Jadzia.

					SISKO
			No, you're Ezri. Ezri Dax. 
			You've been given eight lifetimes 
			worth of experience -- I know 
			it's confusing right now, but in 
			time you'll see it's a wonderful 
			gift.

					EZRI 
			It's a gift I don't deserve.

	Sisko slams the PADD on his desk --

					SISKO 
			If that's the way you feel, then 
			go back to Trill. Talk to the 
			Symbiosis Commission -- maybe 
			you can convince them to take the 
			symbiont out of you.

					EZRI 
			I wish they could. But removing 
			the symbiont would kill me, you 
			know that.

	Sisko stands and moves around his desk.

					SISKO 
			If you're leaving Starfleet, 
			you're going to have to find 
			something to do. Maybe you could 
			be one of those people who takes 
			care of the symbiont pools? It's 
			quiet in those caves. No one

			the rest of your life 
			underground, in the dark, 
			stirring mud. Eighty or ninety 
			years of that might be just what 
			you need.
				(beat) 
			And as for Dax? That symbiont's 
			had eight amazing lives -- so 
			what if the ninth is a waste?

					EZRI 
			Stop it, Benjamin. I thought you

					SISKO
				(cutting her off) 
			I do understand. You were right. 
			You don't deserve the Dax 
			symbiont. And frankly, you don't 
			deserve to wear that uniform.

	Ezri is speechless. Sisko picks up the PADD.

			Now, if you want to skip the

					WORF
				(getting back to his
				bat'leth)
			What do you wish to discuss?

					O'BRIEN 
			Julian swears there's nothing 
			going on between him and Ezri. 
			There's no reason for you to be 
			jealous.

					WORF
				(anger rising) 
			This has nothing to do with 
			jealousy. I know the Doctor 
			cared for Jadzia. But this woman 
			is not Jadzia. And treating her 
			as if she were dishonors her 
			memory.

					O'BRIEN 
			No, treating Ezri like a stranger 
			dishonors Jadzia's memory.

	O'Brien's words speak to the confusion Worf is 
	feeling, and in a sudden motion, he vents his 
	frustration and swings his bat'leth down to SMASH

					WORF 
			It doesn't make sense. She is

	O'Brien sees the pain in Worf's features, gives him 
	a moment to calm down.

					O'BRIEN 
			I don't have an answer for you, 
			Worf. But let me ask you this: 
			how do you think Jadzia would've 
			wanted you to treat Ezri?

					WORF
			There is no way to know.

					O'BRIEN
			Yes, there is. And the person

					GARAK 
			Kalandra?

					EZRI

					GARAK 
			Yes... the transmissions did

					EZRI 
			If the offensive goes well, 
			Starfleet will have you to thank 
			for it.

					GARAK
				(tugging at his 
				collar) 
			That's very gratifying...

					EZRI 
			I just thought you should know...

	Garak slaps his SEAMER down, turns away.

	Garak.

					EZRI 
			Let's just hope it goes well. 
			The Cardassians will put up a 
			strong fight.

					GARAK 
			Indeed they will. But in the 
			end, they'll lose.

					EZRI
			How can you be so sure?

					GARAK 
			Because they won't be expecting 
			an attack.

	He dabs at the sheen of SWEAT on his forehead,

					GARAK
				(more to himself) 
			All those Cardassians are going

					EZRI 
			I suppose that's one way to look 
			at it.

	Garak starts to pace, trying to fight back the 
	claustrophobic panic he's feeling.

					GARAK
			What other way is there?

					EZRI 
			That by helping to end the war, 
			you're saving lives.

					GARAK 
			Who will I be saving -- Humans, 
			Klingons, Romulans?

					EZRI 
			And Cardassians.

					GARAK 
			No, not Cardassians. They're

	Garak's breath catches in his throat and he has to 
	fight to regain it -- his legs give way underneath 
	him and he has to hold on to the table for support. 
	Ezri moves to him and he fiercely grabs hold of her.

					GARAK

			Don't you see? I wanted to

					GARAK

			When I first agreed to help

	where Ezri is once again standing in front of 
	Sisko's desk -- a mirror image of scene 37B.

					SISKO
				(re: the PADD in his 
				hand) 
			Now what?

					EZRI 
			It's my request to be reinstated 
			into Starfleet.

					SISKO
			I can't send this to Starfleet 
			Command.

					EZRI 
			Why not?

					SISKO
			Because I never sent in your 
			resignation.

					EZRI
				(smiles) 
			I had a feeling you didn't mean 
			all those things you said to me. 
			You were just trying to rattle my 
			cage.

					SISKO
			You've done it to me often 
			enough. I'm glad it worked. 

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE     58A.

45   CONTINUED:

					SISKO (Cont'd)
				(off her look) 
			Garak's asked that the latest 
			Cardassian transmissions be sent 
			to the Infirmary.
				(beat) 
			Well done.

	Sisko is sincere in his congratulations, but a bit
	subdued.

					EZRI
			Thanks.
				(studying him)
			Somehow I thought you'd be
			happier to hear I'm staying in
			Starfleet.

					SISKO
			I guess I'd be happier if you
			were staying here at D.S. Nine.

					EZRI
			Me, too.
				(rueful)
			But you know I can't.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE      59.

45   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO 
			I hope Captain Raymer knows how 
			lucky she is. She's getting a 
			hell of a counselor.

	Off the moment between them...

46   INT. GUEST QUARTERS

	where Ezri is packing her SUITCASE. A CHIME at the 
	door.

					EZRI 
			Yes.

	To her surprise, the door OPENS to reveal Worf. 
	Neither of them knows quite what to say.

					WORF 
			May I come in?

					EZRI 
			Of course.

	Worf ENTERS, and we can see that coming here has 
	made him very uncomfortable.

					WORF
			I understand that you are leaving 
			in the morning.

					EZRI 
			That's right.

					WORF
				(with difficulty) 
			I am not certain that I have 
			treated you the way Jadzia 
			would've wanted me to.

					EZRI 
			You'll get no argument from me 
			there.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE      60.

46   CONTINUED:

	Worf turns away as he tries to make sense of his 
	feelings...

					WORF 
			I loved her with all my heart.

	Ezri takes a step toward Worf's back, wanting to 
	hold him and make him feel better, but she stops 
	herself, knowing that she can't.

					EZRI
				(softly)
			And she loved you...

					WORF 
			Part of me is glad to know that 
			she is not gone forever... but 
			even so, in some ways it would be 
			easier if she were.

	Ezri's eyes well with tears. Though Worf's back is 
	to her, she can sense the pain underneath his stoic 
	exterior.

					EZRI 
			I know.

					WORF
			I have heard that the captain has 
			offered you a position as station 
			counselor.
				(turning to face her) 
			I would not want you to decline 
			on my account.

	Ezri is overwhelmed by Worf's gesture, but she wants 
	to be sure he means it.

					EZRI 
			Worf, I can't stay. I couldn't 
			do that to you.

					WORF
			Do you wish to stay?

					EZRI
				(admitting it) 
			Very much.

					WORF
			Then do. Jadzia would not have 
			wanted you to leave because of me.

					EZRI
				(touched) 
			Thank you.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE      61.

46   CONTINUED:	(2)

	He nods that it's settled. With a last look between 
	them, he heads for the door. Before leaving, he has 
	one last thing to say.

					WORF 
			It will be a long time before I 
			can accept that I have lost her. 
			Until then...

	Worf stops, unsure how to put it.

					EZRI
				(gently) 
			You need some breathing room. I 
			understand.

	With a last, emotionally charged look between them, 
	Worf EXITS. Off Ezri's face as she watches him 
	go...

47   INT. WARDROOM - CLOSE - A HAND

	as it pins a PIP to a collar.

	ADJUST to REVEAL that Sisko is giving Ezri her 
	lieutenant's insignia in a promotion ceremony.

	JAKE, Kira, Odo, Bashir, O'Brien, Quark, Garak and 
	Morn stand at the forefront of a SMALL CROWD. There 
	are TWO FERENGI WAITERS, a few BAJORAN DIGNITARIES 
	and the rest are STARFLEET OFFICERS -- including a 
	VULCAN and a BOLIAN. The wardroom table has been 
	moved out to make room, and Quark has set up a 
	BUFFET table along one wall. Worf is nowhere to be 
	seen.

					SISKO
			Congratulations, lieutenant.

	APPLAUSE from the gathered group.

					SISKO 
			I want you to take a good look 
			around.
				(grave) 
			Because you've just agreed to 
			take responsibility for the 
			mental health of everyone in this 
			room.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE      62.

47   CONTINUED:

					SISKO (Cont'd)
				(smiling)
			You've got your work cut out for
			you.

	LAUGHTER and smiles all around. Some people head
	for the buffet, while others gather round to
	congratulate Ezri.

					BASHIR
			It's a good thing they made you a
			lieutenant. I can't see taking
			advice from an ensign.

					O'BRIEN
			Since when do you take advice
			from anyone?

	Ezri smiles, and the pair move off to the buffet 
	table. Odo and Kira approach.

					ODO
			Why don't you join us for dinner 
			tonight?

	Ezrils sure they're just doing this to be kind.

					EZRI 
			I don't want to put you out.

					KIRA
			Please come. It'll take the 
			pressure off me. He just sits 
			there and counts how many times I 
			chew.

					EZRI 
				(smiles) 
			I'll be there.

	Kira and Odo move off, and Ezri scans the room, 
	looking for the one face that's missing -- Worf. As 
	she moves to look for him, we DROP OFF on --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE      63.

48   SISKO AND JAKE

					JAKE
				(watching Ezri pass) 
			She is cute.

					SISKO
			She's also about three hundred 
			years too old for you.

	Jake's smile falters as he remember this is true, 
	and we PICK UP Quark as he passes by, carrying a 
	PLATE of food. He approaches Ezri, who's still 
	looking to see if Worf's around.

					QUARK
				(all charm) 
			I took the liberty of putting 
			together a plate for you.

					EZRI
				(taking the plate) 
			Thanks, Quark.
				(hopeful) 
			Worf's not here, is he?

					QUARK
				(suddenly worried) 
			Good question.

	He hurries off, in case Worf is around. Ezri scans 
	the room, looking for Worf, and bumps into --

49   GARAK

	A
 moment as they regard each other.

					GARAK 
			Congratulations, quite a crowd.

					EZRI 
			I hope it's not making you 
			uncomfortable.

					GARAK
				(a beat) 
			Not at all.

	A moment between them, and he moves off. Ezri looks 
	around, catches sight of a figure in the back. It's 
	Worf, standing by himself with a TANKARD of 
	bloodwine in his hand.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Afterimage" - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT FIVE      64.

49   CONTINUED:

	When their eyes meet across the room, she breaks 
	into a smile, surprised and touched to see that he's 
	here. Worf holds her gaze, then raises his glass 
	slightly -- a gesture of goodwill that means 
	everything to her.

	The moment between them is broken when Sisko swoops 
	down on Ezri and takes her by the arm.

					SISKO 
			I need you to explain something 
			to someone.

50   WORF

	as he watches her move off with Sisko, then heads 
	for the door.

51   EZRI

	trying to explain things to Morn, as Sisko and a few 
	of the others look on.

					EZRI 
			Morn, it's me. Dax.

	Morn shakes his head -- he's not buying it. Sisko 
	and the others break into smiles, and we start to 
	PULL BACK from the group. Off the image of Ezri 
	surrounded by the people Jadzia loved, we...

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FIVE                         
                            THE END
