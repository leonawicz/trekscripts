	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	a small speck heading toward us from a great distance.

					PULASKI (V.O.)
			Medical log, Stardate 42437.5.
			Ira Graves is arguably the
			greatest human mind in the known
			universe...

	The great ship streaks by, racing toward its
	destination.

					PULASKI (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			For years he's lived in near
			isolation on a remote planet,
			devoting full time to his
			revolutionary work...

2    INT. TURBOLIFT - CLOSE ON PULASKI

	riding up alone.

					PULASKI (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			Eight hours ago, we monitored a
			message from his assistant,
			urgently requesting medical aid.
			It seems Graves' health is failing
			rapidly -- I only hope we can
			reach him in time...

3    STAY WITH PULASKI

	as the lift stops and she steps out onto the bridge.
	Before her, WESLEY is at Conn, a CREWMAN at Ops, WORF
	at Tactical. She MOVES to Command to join RIKER and
	PICARD...

					PICARD
			Any response from Gravesworld,
			Mister Worf?

        STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - TEASER        2.

3    CONTINUED:

					WORF
			Nothing sir. Not since their
			initial communication.

	Picard frowns. Riker turns to Pulaski...

					RIKER
			They send out a plea for help,
			then shut off the transmitters
			so they can't tell if help's on
			the way. Doesn't make much sense,
			does it?

					PICARD
			What's our e.t.a. at the planet,
			Mister Crusher?

					WESLEY
			Thirty-six minutes to orbit, sir.

	Picard turns to Pulaski -- his question more a
	statement.

					PICARD
			You understand the importance of
			doing everything we can for Doctor
			Graves.

					PULASKI
			Of course, Captain.

					PICARD
			Starfleet Command believes his
			work in quantum physics is
			reaching a critical stage. They
			consider this a priority one
			action.

					PULASKI
			A man is ill, Captain. Treating
			him is my priority one.
			Regardless of who he is.

	Picard raises his eyebrows in mild surprise. Is she
	sparring with him or merely stating a fact? Behind
	him, Riker is smiling, amused by her blunt way of
	saying things.

4    INT. TEN-FORWARD ROOM - CLOSE ON TROI

	downing a sea-green liquid in an exotic "chaser" glass.
	She savors the drink, her eyes lighting up as she
	slowly swallows.

        STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - TEASER        3.

4    CONTINUED:

					TROI
			It's wonderful. What is it?

5    PULL BACK

	to see GEORDI and TWO CREWPERSONS sitting next to her,
	with GUINAN behind the bar.

					GUINAN
			A year on the planet Thurasia is
			four hundred and ninety days long.
			It rains twice, and only twice.
			You're drinking Thurasian rain
			water.

					GEORDI
				(empty glass in hand)
			Water? Tastes more like...

					TROI
			Heaven.

					GEORDI
			Exactly. Where can I get some
			more of this?

	Guinan takes his glass with a smile.

					GUINAN
			'Fraid that's the last of it.
			Next rainfall in a hundred and
			sixty three days.

	Troi looks at her empty glass wistfully.

					TROI
			I'm not sure I can wait that long.

6    ANGLE TO INCLUDE DATA

	joining his friends at the bar.

					GEORDI
				(to Data)
			Hey, old friend. Any luck?

	Data looks extremely satisfied.

					DATA
			I believe my quest has ended in
			complete success.

        STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - TEASER        4.

6    CONTINUED:

	Geordi turns to the others and explains what they're
	referring to...

					GEORDI
			Data's been scouring the library,
			in search of the perfect joke.

					DATA
			I have explored seventy-six
			thousand, two hundred and
			twenty-three anecdotes thus far.

					TROI
			Why, Data?

					DATA
			It is an attempt to find the most
			humorous anecdote in recorded
			history. And I believe I have
			done just that.

					GUINAN
			This I gotta hear.

	All eyes are on Data -- everyone's primed to hear the
	anecdote to end all anecdotes. Data's eyes sparkle in
	anticipation. Just before he begins, he throws back
	his head and LAUGHS THAT PECULIAR STILTED LAUGH of his,
	as if to say "boy is this going to be funny." The laugh
	ends too abruptly, like someone pulled a plug.

					DATA
				(deliberate)
			There were twelve birds sitting
			on a fence... Six had a notion
			to fly away. How many were left?

7    ANGLE ON HIS AUDIENCE

	looking at one another, thinking this better have a
	great punchline. Geordi shrugs...

					GEORDI
			Okay, I'll bite. Six.

	Data bursts into his awkward laugh again.

					DATA
				(happy, glowing)
			No, twelve! They only had a
			notion to fly away!

        STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - TEASER        5.

7    CONTINUED:

	With quick mechanical movements, Data looks from person
	to person, a stiff smile plastered on his face. The
	smile fades, replaced by a look of complete surprise.
	He can't believe the others aren't laughing. In fact,
	the only sound WE HEAR is A SMALL GROAN emanating from
	Geordi.

					DATA
			You did not find it wildly
			hilarious?

					GEORDI
			What do you think?

	Geordi indicates the others. Some have stone-faces
	while others look like they've just been slapped.

					DATA
			Perhaps I should have described
			the interesting plumage of --

					GUINAN
			-- Data honey, I don't think it
			would've helped. That joke
			chilled my blood.

	Guinan smiles and shivers. Geordi EXITS the bar,
	patting a deeply perplexed Data on the shoulder as he
	goes.

8    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - MOVING WITH GEORDI

	as he crosses to Ops, passing Picard, Riker and Pulaski
	in the Command Area.

					WORF
			Receiving a transmission from
			Gravesworld, sir. It's unfocused.
			Not directed specifically at us.

					PICARD
			On screen, Mister Worf.

9    ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	KAREEN BRIANON a strikingly beautiful if somewhat
	frail-looking woman in her early twenties. She seems
	anxious -- nervously looking over her shoulder as she
	speaks. We join her transmission in progress...

        STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - TEASER        6.

9    CONTINUED:

					KAREEN
			... If anyone can hear me, please
			send a doctor. Things are getting
			worse --

	Kareen cuts off as she turns to look at something else
	in the room. Suddenly the screen goes dead...

					PICARD
			Try and raise her, Mister Crusher.
			Tell them we're minutes away.

					WESLEY
			It's no good, sir. I don't
			believe they're receiving us.

	Picard paces, clearly frustrated.

					WORF
			Our records show that she and
			Graves are the only ones living
			on the planet, Captain.

					RIKER
			Then what scared her?

10   MOVE IN ON PICARD

	wondering the same thing.

									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER                          

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       7.

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Same setting, same situation.

					GEORDI
			Sir, I'm picking up another
			signal... but it's not from the
			planet.

					WESLEY
			Confirmed. Point of origin...
			sector three-five mark seven.

					GEORDI
			Signal is very weak, sir. Audio
			only.

					PICARD
			Pipe it through, Mister La Forge.

	THE SOUND OF CRACKLING STATIC fills the air.

					MAN'S COM VOICE
			... Mayday! Mayday! This is
				(static)
			-- questing emergency assistance.
				(static)
			Outer hull breached
				(static)
			Environmental systems compro --
				(static)
			Need immediate

	ROLLING WAVES OF STATIC overwhelm the rest of the
	message. Picard signals Geordi to cut off the noise.
	Worf punches in a few commands at his position...

					WORF
			I show the Mary Rogers in that
			general vicinity, Captain. She's
			a transport ship, used to ferry
			settlers to new colonies. No
			other ships of any kind in this
			sector.

					RIKER
				(concerned)
			Outer hull breached -- their air
			must be leaking out.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       8.

11   CONTINUED:

					PULASKI
			There may be hundreds of colonists
			aboard that ship. We've got to
			help them!

					PICARD
			And what about Graves?

					PULASKI
			He's one man. And we don't even
			know the nature of his illness.

					PICARD
			He's the man we came to assist!
			I have my orders, Doctor.

	Pulaski stews -- silence reigns on the bridge. This is
	difficult for Picard; a tragic, no-win situation.

					WORF
			Suggestion, sir.

	Picard swivels to face Worf.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			Suggest we execute long range
			transport of away team to assist
			Dr. Graves at earliest possible
			moment. We can use the mass of
			the planet to slingshot us toward
			the stricken liner, thus making
			up most of the lost time.

					PICARD
				(nodding, thoughtful)
			Mister Crusher, make it so -- prepare
			for extended touch and go orbit.

					WESLEY
				(complying)
			Aye sir.

					PICARD
			The transport may be a bit tricky.
			I'd like you to handle it, Mister
			La Forge.

					GEORDI
			Understood, Captain.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       9.

11   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Assemble an away team, Number One.
			Include whatever medical
			assistants the Doctor deems
			necessary.

					PULASKI
			Excuse me sir, but I'd be more
			useful dealing with the Mary
			Rogers. There may be hundreds
			who'll need attention --

					PICARD
			-- Thank you Doctor, but I'll make
			those decisions.
				(pause)
			You're going to Gravesworld.

12   INT. TEN-FORWARD - ON DATA AND GUINAN

	talking, the bar between them. Data is in a daze...

					DATA
			I cannot comprehend it. It is
			beyond my ability to reason.

					GUINAN
			Don't feel too bad, Data. Humor
			is subjective.

					DATA
			But this anecdote had all the
			elements humans find so diverting!
			A play on words, colorful
			characters, deception, a lively
			setting --

					GUINAN
				(tongue in cheek)
			-- Maybe it's the birds.

					DATA
				(cocking his head)
			Interesting. How so?

					GUINAN
			Birds are considered to have
			boring personalities. They just
			sit around and eat seed all day.
			Maybe squawk once in a while.
			Boring.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       10.

12   CONTINUED:

	Data begins to consider this point seriously. Guinan
	suppresses a smile as she continues...

					GUINAN
			In fact, there's only one thing
			birds do that's funny, but you
			couldn't put that in a joke and
			keep it tasteful.
				(leans forward)
			Now chickens. Chickens are funny.

	Data is surprised. He's about to ask her to elaborate,
	when Riker steps up to the bar.

					RIKER
				(cheerful)
			Hello Guinan. Keeping this guy
			out of trouble?

					GUINAN
			It's a challenge, but I'm trying.

					DATA
			Excuse me sir, but in what way
			is Guinan attempting to restrain
			me from adversity?

					RIKER
			Never mind, Data, I was only
			joking.

	Data thinks, then suddenly explodes into a three second
	burst of LAUGHTER. Once finished, he looks from Riker
	to Guinan, uncertainty written on his face.

					DATA
			That joke was funny. Was it not?

					GUINAN
			It wasn't meant to be, Data.

	Now Data's really confused.

					GUINAN
				(to Riker)
			Are you really going down to see
			Ira Graves? The Ira Graves?

					RIKER
				(intrigued smile)
			How did you know about that?

	Guinan smiles slyly and ignores the question.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       11.

12   CONTINUED: (2)

					GUINAN
			Remember Will -- great men have
			great egos.

	Riker smiles back, wondering why this sounds like a
	warning. He slaps Data on the shoulder.

					RIKER
			Come on Data. A great man awaits.

	They nod good-bye to Guinan and head for the turbolift.
	Riker takes a last look at:

13   GUINAN

	still smiling a smile that says "I know something you
	don't know."

14   INT. TURBOLIFT - RIKER AND DATA

	ride down together.

					DATA
			May I ask a question, sir?

					RIKER
			I think you just did.

					DATA
				(thinking it over)
			Quite correct. May I ask you
			another question after this one?

					RIKER
				(chuckling)
			Sure, what's on your mind?

					DATA
			Do you think it is pointless for
			me to try and understand humor?

					RIKER
			Pointless? Not necessarily.

					DATA
			I believe that comprehending what
			is truly funny will bring me
			closer to... humanness.
				(pause)
			Until recently, I thought I was
			making progress.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       12.

15   INT. CORRIDOR - DATA AND RIKER

	exit the turbolift and head down the corridor toward
	the transporter...

					DATA
			For example Commander, do you find
			this amusing? There were
			twelve....... aquatic fowl sitting
			on a fence, and six had --

					RIKER
			-- Twelve. They only had a notion
			to fly away.

	Data stops in his tracks.

					DATA
			How did you --

					RIKER
			-- Are you kidding? That joke's
			become a legend on this ship.

16   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - WORF, PULASKI, TROI (OPTICAL)

	and a MED-TECH are joined by Riker and Data (still
	mulling over the status of his legendary anecdote).
	Geordi is at the transporter controls. Riker wastes no
	time in leading his team onto the platform.

					RIKER
			Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We
			don't know what's going on down
			there; no need to take chances.

					WORF
			Agreed, sir.

					GEORDI
			Remember folks, this is a long
			range transport. The effects will
			be a little unusual.

					PULASKI
			How do you mean?

	Riker cuts in before Geordi can reply.

					RIKER
			Understood. Energize.

	Pulaski turns to Riker just as they begin to
	transport...

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       13.

16   CONTINUED:

					PULASKI
			Wait a minute! I don't under --

	And they're GONE before the sentence is complete.

17   INT. LIVING ROOM ON GRAVESWORLD - THE AWAY TEAM
(OPTICAL)

	begins to MATERIALIZE in comfortable if somewhat
	cluttered living quarters. Behind them we can see the
	planet through the window, including the multi-colored
	rings that encircle her.

	It takes longer than usual for their materialization.
	We hear the end of Pulaski's sentence as her body
	becomes solid.

					PULASKI
			-- ssstttaaaaaannnnddd!

					RIKER
			You do now.

	All seem momentarily disoriented. Troi puts her hand
	to her head.

					TROI
			Ohh... I know this is crazy, but
			for a moment I felt like I was
			trapped inside that wall.

					WORF
			You were. For a moment.

	Troi thinks that over. Behind her, Riker signals the
	ship.

					RIKER
			Riker to Enterprise.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Go ahead, Number One.

					RIKER
			We've arrived in Graves' home.
			All's quiet so far -- on the other
			hand, no one knew we were coming.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       14.

17   CONTINUED:

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Use caution and investigate.
			Protect Graves' health at all
			cost. We're leaving orbit to
			assist the Mary Rogers. Back as
			soon as possible.

					RIKER
			Understood, Captain. Riker out.

18   ANGLE FAVORING DATA

	transfixed by something only he sees.

					RIKER (O.S.)
			Let's look around -- see if
			anybody's home.

					DATA
			Someone is home, sir.

19   WIDE ANGLE

	as the others turn to see what Data sees. Kareen
	Brianon stands in the doorway, looking even more
	ravishing than before.

					KAREEN
			You heard me. Thank God.

	Kareen moves toward them and speaks in a halting, shy
	voice.

					KAREEN
				(continuing)
			I'm Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves'
			assistant. Are you... you with
			Starfleet?

					RIKER
			Yes, we're from a ship called the
			Enterprise. We monitored your
			distress call but you never
			acknowledged our response.

					KAREEN
			I'm sorry, I... couldn't take the
			chance...

	Riker moves forward and studies her eyes. Perhaps he's
	somewhat smitten by her beauty.

       STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE       15.

19   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			What chance?

					GRAVES (O.S.)
				(stern)
			The chance that I might find out
			someone was coming.

	All eyes turn to see DOCTOR IRA GRAVES, standing behind
	them in a corner of the room (a wall door sliding shut
	behind him). He's a small man in his late seventies,
	with intense, darting eyes, and a healthy wild-looking
	shock of white hair. His skin is chalk-white, his
	torso frail. We get the impression of strong mind,
	weak body.

					GRAVES
			Kareen knew full well that I would
			not be pleased.

					KAREEN
			I had no choice. I refuse to
			stand by and watch you
			deteriorate.

					PULASKI
			What symptoms have you noticed?

					KAREEN
			He has pain, shortness of breath,
			irritability --

					GRAVES
			-- Ridiculous! I'm as healthy
			as a Rigellian ox!

					KAREEN
			We'll see about that, Ira.
				(to away team)
			I hope one of you is a doctor.

	Pulaski steps forward.

					PULASKI
			Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Call
			me Kate.

					GRAVES
			No offense, but I don't want you
			touching me in a medical way.
			It's no secret that I don't like
			people much, and I like doctors
			even less than people!

					PULASKI
			Funny, I always thought doctors
			were people.

					GRAVES
			And you were wrong. Just ask any
			patient.
				(pause)
			Although I will admit for a doctor
			you're a nice looking woman.

	Graves is giving her body a slightly lecherous
	appraisal. Pulaski looks at Riker and rolls her eyes.
	Graves sets his sights on Troi...

					GRAVES
			And what have we here?... Another
			lovely specimen of womanhood.

					RIKER
			I thought you didn't like people?

					GRAVES
			I like women. Always try to
			forget that they're people.

	Graves slides closer to Troi, never taking his eyes off
	her cleavage.

					TROI
				(a bit embarrassed)
			I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honor
			to meet you Doctor Graves.

					GRAVES
			Yes! Yes, of course it is! This
			is one of the truly great moments
			of your life! Believe me honey,
			you'll never meet anyone half as
			sagacious as me. I'm a phenom.

	Graves' bragging comes out in such an enthusiastic,
	matter of fact way, one can't really be angry with him.
	To him, his statements are simply facts; he is
	incredibly brilliant. His egotism suits him. It's
	perversely lovable, like the boastful old veteran
	reminiscing about the men he killed in the war.

			Oh there I go again -- shocking
			people with the truth. I can
			appreciate how hard it is for
			others to try and keep up with
			my mind. I don't mean to burden
			with my brilliance. It just works
			out that way.

	Over in a corner of the room, Kareen has been studying
	Worf.

					KAREEN
				(soft, uncertain)
			Excuse me sir... Are you a
			Romulan?

	Worf's face twists into a scowl, as though he smells
	something unpleasant.

					WORF
			Hardly.

20   WIDE ANGLE

					GRAVES
			He's a Klingon, Kareen.
				(to others)
			Kareen has lived here since her
			father died when she was quite
			young. Her only knowledge of
			inhuman races comes from me. I
			suppose Klingons and Romulans must
			look much alike.

	Worf snaps his head toward Riker, infuriated.

					WORF
				(low growl)
			Do I have to stand here and be
			insulted?

					GRAVES
			No insult intended, Mister Klingon.
				(to Pulaski)
			See Doctor? Nothing wrong with
			my hearing --

	At this moment Graves is overcome with a brief but
	vicious wracking COUGH. It doubles him over
	momentarily, but he quickly tries to pass it off by
	honing in on Data.

	Graves stands right in front of Data, reaching up and
	studying his face with ardent fascination.

					DATA
			Uh, Lieutenant Commander Data,
			sir --

					GRAVES
			-- Shhh!

	Graves uses both hands to swivel Data's head from side
	to side, as he examines the structure of the android's
	ears, jawline, nose, etc. Behind Graves, Pulaski is
	taking the opportunity to run a medical scanner up and
	down the scientist's back. Unaware, Graves thinks out
	loud as he continues to peruse Data...

					GRAVES
				(continuing)
			Functional... Durable... Obviously
			no concern whatsoever for
			aesthetic values.

	Data frowns -- now he's insulted. Graves releases his
	head.

					GRAVES
				(continuing)
			Looks like Soong's work.

					DATA
			Quite correct, sir! Did you know
			Soong?

					GRAVES
			Know him?!
				(raspy cough)
			I taught him everything he knows.
			You could say I was the father
			of his work...
				(smiles as thought
				 occurs)
			Which kinda makes me your
			grandfather, doesn't it sonny?

	Graves spins as he becomes aware that Pulaski has been
	scanning him. He scowls and backs away, but it's clear
	she's found out enough already.

			Damn doctors! Always sneaking

			it's going to hurt like hell!
				(pause)
			Well I'm not paying the bill for
			this!

					PULASKI
				(quietly)
			There won't be a bill, Doctor.
				(to Riker)
			May I speak with you privately?

					GRAVES
			What for! Anything you think you
			found's more my business than his!

	Riker thinks about it, then nods, giving Pulaski the
	go-ahead to speak freely. She hesitates...

					GRAVES
				(continuing)
			Go on, gorgeous! Whatever the
			hell it is, I can take it.

					PULASKI
				(uncomfortable)
			I checked twice to make certain...
			You have Varnay's disease.

	Kareen GASPS. Graves barely reacts.

			I'm sorry, Ira. You're dying,

			You wanted to see me, sir.

					PICARD
				(still staring at space)
			Yes Ensign. I assume you would

					WESLEY
				(brightening)
			Yes sir. His theories on spatial

			his work in thermodynamics is --

					PICARD
			-- Good, I get the idea.
			Providing his health is reasonably
			intact, I'm going to appoint you

				(excited)
			Yes sir. Understood.
				(pause, thoughtful)
			But why me, sir? I mean, not that
			I'm complaining --

			-- Graves has a reputation for

			Some. I could help with that but

					KAREEN

			He won't even let me get near him,

					RIKER
			Has he been... like a father to

					KAREEN
			More like a teacher.

23   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			I sense that his feelings for you
			are very warm. He's attracted
			to you in many ways.

					KAREEN
			Attracted?... I know -- I've felt
			certain feelings from him. But
			he's always been a gentleman.
				(to Riker)
			Had I been older... perhaps we
			could've been lovers. But nothing
			like that ever happened between
			us.

	She gives Riker a lingering look, then turns and walks
	away from him...

					KAREEN
				(continuing)
			Now, it's like he's afraid to face

			is your friend, Data.

24   INT. GRAVES' LABORATORY - GRAVES

	is attending to a complex computer terminal, softly
	WHISTLING THE SONG, "IF I ONLY HAD A HEART," while
	behind him Data is blowing through some of his written
	material at breakneck speed.

					DATA
			I have noticed Doctor, that you --

					GRAVES
			-- Call me Grandpa. Seems more
			touching in my final hours.

					DATA
			I have noticed Grandpa, that you
			keep repeating the same notes of
			a musical passage that I am
			unfamiliar with.

					GRAVES
			It's an ancient little tune called
			"If I Only Had A Heart." A rather
			plaintive lament sung by a
			mechanical man who longs to be
			human. It's his only wish.

	Struck by the image, Data stops what he's doing and
	MOVES closer to Graves...

					DATA
			What happens to this man?

					GRAVES
			He finds out that he is human
			after all. Always was -- just
			worried so much he never realized
			it.

					DATA
			A happy ending. The mechanical
			man got his wish.

					GRAVES
			Stories often have happy endings.
			It's life that throws you for a
			loop.

	Data seems to think deeply about what he's saying.
	Graves notes his thoughtfulness and continues...

					GRAVES
				(continuing)
			It must be hard for you... So
			close to being human and yet never
			really knowing what it's like to
			feel pain.

					DATA
			But... pain is unpleasant... is
			it not?

	Graves looks off into space -- a dying man allowing his
	mind to explore the vagaries of life. He closes his
	eyes, breathes deeply, speaks slowly...

					GRAVES
			Pain... Lust... envy...
			pleasure... desire. Do you know
			what desire is, Data?

					DATA
			Desire? It is to long for or
			crave, a wish, a request, a --

					GRAVES
				(strong)
			-- Do you know what desire is?

	Data pauses. He realizes what Graves is asking him.
	When he answers, he almost sounds sad.

24   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			No... I do not suppose I will ever
			know what it really is.

	Graves nods slowly.

					GRAVES
			I feel pity for you. Your
			existence is a kind of walking
			purgatory -- neither dead nor
			alive, never really feeling
			anything. Just existing. Just
			existing.

	Graves fights off A COUGHING SPELL. When he comes out
	of it, there's a small, ironic smile on his face...

					GRAVES
			Listen to me -- a dying man taking
			the time to mourn a man who will
			never know death. Funny, isn't
			it?

					DATA
				(softly)
			Funny?... I have... difficulty
			discerning what is funny.

	Graves turns his back on Data so that the android
	doesn't see his face turn grim.

					GRAVES
			I've had the same difficulty most
			of my life. We're much alike.

25   INT. LIVING ROOM ON GRAVESWORLD - RIKER
	ENTERS, rejoining the others.

					RIKER
			I just spoke with the captain.
			The Enterprise is minutes away;
			he'll contact us again when she

			Yes. Arrangements are being made

	Kareen pensively looks out the window...

					KAREEN
			It'll be strange to leave here.

	Troi goes to her and places a supportive arm around her
	shoulder.

					TROI
			You're a beautiful young woman,
			and there's a whole universe
			waiting for you out there.

					KAREEN
			I'll be alone. I'll be without
			Ira.

	Troi looks at her colleagues, uncertain of what to say.
	Surprisingly, it is Worf who gently approaches the
	girl.

					WORF
				(lowered tone)
			I know what it is to lose those
			closest to your heart. It will
			be hard... you will feel alone
			at first... but it will surely
			pass, as time passes. I know.

	She looks up at Worf with tears in the corner of her
	eyes. She instinctively knows that his words come from
	a place deep within him. The little girl in her comes
	forward and she embraces Worf, GENTLY SOBBING on his
	chest. The Klingon is caught off guard, initially
	uncomfortable with the situation. Slowly, awkwardly,
	he puts a protective arm around her, looking up at the
	others to make sure they're not laughing at him.

26   INT. GRAVES' LABORATORY - GRAVES

	is still intently working at the computer terminal.
	Data is beside him, obviously pondering their

			You mentioned your impending death

26   CONTINUED:

					GRAVES
			That is because I am an incredible
			man, possessing an iron will and
			nerves of steel. Two traits that
			helped me become the genius I am
			today as well as the lady-killer
			I was in days gone by.

					DATA
				(shocked)
			You condone homicide, sir?

					GRAVES
			It's an expression, Data. It
			means I was once as beautiful as
			I am smart.

	Data looks at the grizzled old man before him with
	amazement.

					DATA
			Really Grandpa?

					GRAVES
				(shrugging)
			No, not really -- but what the
			hell, I'm dying. I can remember
			my life any way I want.

	Graves fights off A COUGH and smiles at "his grandson."

					GRAVES
				(continuing)
			And I'll tell you a little secret,
			Sonny. I don't think I truly will
			be dying.

					DATA
			But... the doctor --

					GRAVES
			-- Oh I'll die, but I won't really

	Graves motions for Data to take a closer look at his

			I've invented a way of
			transferring consciousness into

			to convey my great intelligence
			into this machine, thus cheating
			the Grim Reaper of his greatest
			prize.

					DATA
			Grim Reaper... Is that a farmer
			with no sense of humor?

					GRAVES
			I speak of the personification
			of death itself.
				(coughs)
			But what do you know of death?
			It is a subject forever alien to
			you.

					DATA
			Well Grandpa, that is not
			necessarily true. I do have an
			"off button" if you like. Its
			activation robs me of all
			consciousness -- therefore
			rendering me dead for all intents
			and purposes.

	Data walks over to study an equation on a chart on the
	wall. He does not see the thoughtful expression on
	Graves' face...

					DATA
				(continuing)
			It is not something I enjoy
			contemplating.

					GRAVES
			I can understand that; still the
			analogy is a good one.

	Riker goes to him.

					RIKER
			Welcome to Gravesworld, sir. This

			I'm very sorry, Ms. Brianon. I'm

			Thank you, Captain. Your people

	Picard nods compassionately and turns to Troi.

					PICARD
			Where's Data?

					TROI
			He's been with Doctor Graves
			almost the entire time. They seem

					PICARD
			Hmm, I suppose I can understand

				(to Pulaski)
			I think we should immediately

			It's probably right. My

			I am not an "it," Doctor. You

38   PULL BACK TO SEE THE LITTLE CONGREGATION

	gathered in a respectful half-circle around him. Troi
	is speaking in a soft, peaceful tone...

					TROI
			... Although we hardly knew him,
			we certainly knew of him. His
			reputation spread throughout the
			galaxy, and his mind touched all
			who cherish science.

39   ANGLE ON KAREEN

	gaunt, sad, gazing at the casket. Slowly, she looks
	over at:

40   DATA

	who seems to be enjoying this. Unnoticed by the
	others, he is looking around, his head bobbing happily,
	a thin smile on his lips.

					TROI (O.S.)
			We gather here today, to say a
			respectful good-bye to Ira
			Ellsworth Graves. A man who --

	Data interrupts by walking in front of Troi to where
	Picard and Riker stand side by side.

40   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			This is not exactly what he
			wanted.

	Riker is annoyed. He indicates the surroundings (some
	of which are implied as being OFF CAMERA).

					RIKER
			You programmed the setting. The
			field, the mountain range --

					DATA
			-- It is not the environment that
			I question, Commander. This was
			one of his favorite places on
			Gravesworld.

					PICARD
			Well what is it then?

					DATA
			It is the tone, the pacing, the
			content of the verbal tribute.
				(to Troi)
			No offense Counselor, but Doctor
			Graves would have desired a
			slightly more personal address.

					RIKER
			And how can you be so sure?

					DATA
			Why he told me, of course.
				(to Picard)
			Perhaps I should take over, sir.

	Picard SIGHS. At last he gives a slight nod.

					PICARD
			If you promise to be brief. When
			I agreed to this, I didn't intend
			for it to interfere with our
			duties. Understood?

					DATA
			Perfectly.

	Data moves before the casket and looks pridefully at
	the old, pale, shriveled face inside. He speaks in a
	trembling voice, with tremendous pride.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Just look at that face. The face
			of a thinker, a warrior, a man
			for all seasons.

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE      37.

41   ANGLE ON WESLEY AND WORF

	each squinting to get a better look at Graves. A
	warrior?

					DATA
			Yes friends, Ira Graves was all
			that and more.

42   REACTION SHOT OF THE OTHERS

	at the sound of "Ira Graves," the temperature rises ten
	degrees and the GROUND RUMBLES for a few moments.

					DATA
			Ira Graves was a great
			humanitarian.

	Again the temperature goes up and the GROUND SHAKES AND
	ROARS. People are beginning to perspire...

					DATA
				(continuing)
			To know know know him, was to love
			love love him. But Ira Graves
			was not perfect.

	The same response, stronger now, at the sound of his
	name. The GROUND SHAKES so hard they're almost knocked
	off their feet. An angry Picard wipes a layer of sweat
	off his brow...

					PICARD
			Data...

					DATA
				(continuing, unaware)
			Perhaps his greatest fault was
			that he was too selfless. Cared
			too much for his fellow man.

					PICARD
			Data! That's enough!

					DATA
			I am almost finished sir.

					PICARD
			You are finished, you mean.

43   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - RIKER AND PICARD

	stand across from Data.

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE      38.

43   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			What's become of your judgment?

					DATA
			Perhaps I am maturing, sir.

					PICARD
			Do you consider it mature to
			program the mountains to tremble
			every time you say the name, Ira
			Graves?

	Data sheepishly looks down at the ground.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Not to mention the air warming
			at the very thought of him. We
			would've been barbequed if we'd
			stayed much longer.

	Data is even more ashamed -- suddenly incredibly down
	on himself.

					DATA
			I seem to have overdone it.

					RIKER
			To put it mildly.

					DATA
			I brought shame to this ship.
			To the good name of Starfleet.

					PICARD
			Data --

					DATA
			-- I was only trying to carry out
			his wishes. To make sure I kept
			my promise.

					PICARD
			I know that Data.

	Picard is concerned by Data's sudden melancholy. He
	somewhat awkwardly puts a hand on the android's
	shoulder in support.

43   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Look... I realize you've been
			studying the human equation with
			great alacrity, but maybe you've
			been trying just a little too
			hard. Do you know what I mean?

	A somber, doe-eyed Data nods his head. Picard
	continues, actually feeling a bit guilty...

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Try and relax a little. Don't
			try to be so... "human." Just
			be yourself. Okay?

					DATA
				(serious, just a touch
				 of sadness)
			Affirmative, sir. I will work
			on staying within myself. Now
			if you will excuse me, I am due
			on the bridge.

	Picard nods and Data begins to exit. Picard looks at
	Riker and shrugs, hoping he didn't come down on him too
	hard.

44   INT. CORRIDOR - ON DATA

	as he exits the Observation Lounge and walks straight
	toward us. His somber expression is abruptly replaced
	by a pleased, self-confident one. A remarkably sudden
	transition.

	He turns to check out an attractive CREWWOMAN as she
	passes him. When he turns around again he begins to
	WHISTLE as he walks. The tune is familiar: "IF I ONLY
	HAD A HEART."

									FADE OUT.

45   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - TRACKING PICARD AND RIKER

	walking briskly down the corridor.

					RIKER
			I'm concerned, sir. I've never
			seen him act like this.

					PICARD
			Could it be that grandfather
			analogy Graves planted in his
			head?. Data is an orphan in a
			manner of speaking. Maybe the
			loss of Graves really got to him.
			Touched him emotionally.

					RIKER
			I hope that's all it is.

	They stop at a door.

					PICARD
			It's Captain Picard and Commander
			Riker. May we come in?

46   INT. KAREEN'S QUARTERS - PICARD AND RIKER

	ENTER. Kareen sits in a form-fitting leather chair,
	looking very beautiful and very sad.

					PICARD
			We've come to pay our respects,
			Miss Brianon.

					KAREEN
			Thank you, gentlemen. That's most
			thoughtful.

					RIKER
			We're due at Starbase Six in less
			than twelve hours. We thought
			you might enjoy a quick look at
			the bridge before we arrive.

					KAREEN
			Can one see the stars from up
			there?

46   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Oh yes. Closer than you've ever
			seen them before.

	This thought brings the flicker of a smile to her
	lovely face. She stands up gracefully...

					KAREEN
			I think I'd enjoy that very much.

	Each man takes a hand and escorts her out of the room.

47   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	cruising toward Starbase Six.

48   INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

	Data at Ops, Wesley at Conn, Geordi in Command with
	Troi beside him, Worf at Tactical.

					WESLEY
				(grinning)
			That was a great speech, Data.
			To know know him is to love love
			love love love him?!

					DATA
				(dry)
			Taken from a centuries-old Earth
			composition. Your child-like mind
			cannot appreciate the timeworn
			wisdom of its words.

					GEORDI
				(teasing)
			You're not turning into a
			star-crossed artist on us, are
			you Data?

					DATA
			I am many things: artist,
			scholar, lover, genius --

	He cuts off, offended at the LAUGHTER of Geordi and
	Wesley. The two of them think his stoic delivery is
	hilarious.

					GEORDI
			You're getting funnier, I gotta
			hand it to you.
				(laughs, shakes head)
			There's something to be said for
			that deadpan delivery.

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR      42.

49   ANGLE ON THE TURBOLIFT DOOR

	as Picard and Riker ENTER, escorting Kareen. Still
	chuckling, Geordi EXITS the bridge, relinquishing the
	Command Area.

50   CLOSE ON DATA

	frowning as he sees Kareen with the two officers.

51   WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Kareen is enraptured by the bridge, especially the
	viewscreen.

					RIKER
			You're looking in the general
			direction of the constellation
			Pegasus.

	Kareen's eyes are aglow. She truly loves stargazing.
	No one notices that Data is watching them with a
	distinct glower.

	Picard gently touches her shoulder, leading her toward
	the Aft Stations.

					PICARD
			I'm aware of your interest in
			science. Perhaps you'd like to
			--

	Data interrupts with a sullen growl, spinning to face
	them...

					DATA
				(under his breath)
			-- And I am aware of your interest
			in her.

	That said, he quickly faces forward again.

					PICARD
				(sharply)
			What was that, Data?

					DATA
			Nothing sir. Nothing at all.

	Picard is about to say something else, then thinks
	better of it. He turns his attention back to the young
	lady...

					PICARD
			These are our science stations.

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR      43.

52   TWO SHOT OF DATA AND WESLEY

	at their stations. The boy is wide-eyed, having heard
	Data's comment. Data continues to simmer...

					WESLEY
				(whisper)
			What's wrong with you?!

					DATA
				(normal voice)
			I detest hypocrisy. I wish they
			would just come out and admit it.

53   WIDE ANGLE FAVORING PICARD

	who is not about to let that comment pass by.

					PICARD
				(angry)
			Admit what, Mister Data?

	Data calmly turns and addresses Riker and Picard.

					DATA
			That your interest in Kareen is
			not entirely honorable.

	Everyone is shocked.

					WORF
			Data! You are way out of line!

	Data ignores Worf and deliberately walks toward Picard
	and Riker...

					DATA
				(to Picard)
			Try as you might, you cannot win
			her heart. She does not like
			older men...
				(to Riker)
			... or men of limited intellect.

					PICARD
				(controlling his temper)
			Mister Data, you are hereby relieved
			of duty -- Worf, take his station.

					WORF
			Yes sir.

	Worf moves to Ops. Picard continues with Data...

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR      44.

53   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			You will report to your quarters
			immediately. You will not leave
			there until you hear otherwise
			from me. Is that understood?

					DATA
			Sure, I understand.
				(looks at Kareen)
			I understand all too well.

	Everyone's a bit spellbound as Data reaches out and
	gently touches Kareen's cheek before retiring to the
	turbolift. The doors open and he enters...

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Removing the competition will not
			help you, Picard.

	And the doors shut. No one knows what to say -- all
	are stunned. Kareen seems shaky and frightened.

					PICARD
				(to Kareen)
			Do you know what that was all
			about?

	Still disturbed, she shakes her head vigorously.
	Beside her, Troi is mulling something over...

					TROI
				(as a revelation)
			Jealousy... I sensed intense,
			burning jealousy. And it was
			coming from Data!

54   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - DATA

	is standing before a full-length mirror,
	narcissistically studying his own image. He turns
	sideways and goes up on his toes, shamelessly admiring
	his body.

	Geordi ENTERS in a concerned state.

					GEORDI
			I heard what happened but I just
			can't believe it.

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR      45.

54   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Do not trouble yourself, friend.
			I am sure the captain will be by
			to apologize shortly.

					GEORDI
			You expect him to apologize?

	Data doesn't even answer -- he's too enthralled with
	his own image in the glass.

					DATA
			It seems I was too harsh on Soong.
			Notice the strong chin, the finely
			chiseled features, the powerful
			torso. Do you realize that this
			body will never wear out.
				(sighs with pleasure)
			Immortality.

					GEORDI
			What the hell are you talking
			about?

	Picard ENTERS, still angry.

					GEORDI
				(continuing; to Picard)
			He's not himself, sir. I know
			him better than anybody.

	Picard's face twists into a grimace as he notices
	Data's shameless preening before the mirror.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			We're going to Sickbay.

					DATA
				(aloof)
			Oh? Are you ill, sir?

					PICARD
			I'm getting there. Come along.

55   INT. SICKBAY - CLOSE ON PULASKI

	looking displeased.

					PULASKI
			I don't oil machinery.

56   PULL BACK TO SEE

	Pulaski standing across from Picard, with Data sitting
	up on a bed behind them.

					PULASKI
			Why don't you take it down to
			Engineering?

					PICARD
			Because I brought him to you.
			I want a complete medical check
			run on him immediately.

					PULASKI
				(exasperated)
			I'll do the best I can --

					PICARD
			-- I expect nothing less.

					PULASKI
			-- But if it blew a fuse or
			something I may not pick it up.

					PICARD
			I have the utmost faith in your
			abilities, Doctor. I know nothing
			will get by you.

	Behind them, Data has been smiling -- amused at their
	conversation.

									CUT TO:

57   CLOSE-UP OF MEDICAL MONITOR

	graphs rising and falling.

58   PULL BACK TO SEE

	Data lying on a medical bed with Pulaski hovering over
	him, running instruments along his body. Data takes
	the time to leer at her body. Pulaski comments dryly
	without taking her eyes off her instruments...

					PULASKI
			I'm sure there's a reason you're
			looking at me that way.

      STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR      47.

58   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			I am simply looking. Any thought
			of ulterior motive rests with you.
			Perhaps you are projecting your
			own desires.

					PULASKI
				(derisive chuckle)
			Perhaps not. I've had three
			husbands dear, and they've all
			been flesh and blood. For some
			strange reason I like it that way.
				(pause)
			Now shut up and turn over.

					DATA
				(shrugging)
			Very well. It is your loss.

59   INT. ADJOINING ROOM IN SICKBAY - DATA

	WALKS IN as Picard, Pulaski and Troi prepare to discuss
	the results.

					PICARD
			Wait for me in the corridor, Mister
			Data.

					DATA
			What for? This concerns me more
			than it does any of you.

					PICARD
				(raising voice)
			You will wait for me in the
			corridor!

	Data SIGHS and reluctantly EXITS.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			His insubordination is growing
			by leaps and bounds. I could
			throw him in the brig but I'd
			rather try and help him.

59   CONTINUED:

					PULASKI
			Well I really don't know what to
			suggest. Physically it's fit as
			a fiddle. Granted it's not easy
			to examine a tin can the size of
			a human, but I'll be damned if
			I can find anything wrong with
			it.

	Picard begins to pace -- he's frustrated and concerned.

					TROI
			Perhaps we're looking in the wrong
			place, sir.

					PICARD
			Explain.

					TROI
			Well, Data's physical health may
			be unimpaired but it's his mental
			health that needs to be addressed.

					PULASKI
			Are you suggesting it's losing
			its mind?

	Troi thinks before answering...

					TROI
			With your permission Captain,
			there's one way to find out.

60   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - TROI (OPTICAL)

	finishes attaching a thin wire to Data's wrist. We can
	see identical wires running from his chest and head to
	a small black box. Data is sitting before a
	viewscreen, looking displeased...

					TROI
			You remember the psychotronic
			stability examination, don't you
			Data? We all had to take it
			before graduating from the
			Academy.

					DATA
			It was a waste of time then and
			it is a waste of time now.

			machine will do the rest.

	Reluctantly, Data looks up at the screen.

61   ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	a series of images begin to appear:

	A green meadow... a waterfall... fire... the Earth seen
	from space... the Enterprise... a man and woman
	embracing... a baby ... the color yellow... the
	Federation seal...

62   CLOSE ON DATA (OPTICAL)

	the images reflecting off his face.

63   BACK TO VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	images flying by faster now, dissolving into one
	another:

	The blackness of space... an old woman... the color
	red... Picard... an alien landscape... Geordi... a
	Klingon battle cruiser... Remmick... the word
	"honor"... the number 2... a barren orchard... a purple
	sunset...

64   DATA

	squirms in his seat; this is making him uncomfortable.

65   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD AND GEORDI (OPTICAL)

			It's just a guess sir, but, well
			sometimes he wants to be human
			so bad he can taste it. And
			sometimes he is more human than

					PICARD
			Yes...

					GEORDI
			I think your theory might be

			Graves' death may have been the

	Geordi cuts off as Troi appears on the VIEWSCREEN.

					TROI
			I have the results of the tests,
			Captain. I -- I ran two tests
			to make certain.

					PICARD
			Make certain of what?

					TROI
				(concerned)
			There are two distinct
			personalities within Lieutenant
			Commander Data.

					PICARD
			What?! He's an android, that's
			not possible!

					TROI
			Nevertheless it is true. The
			second personality is the
			dominant. It is unbalanced:
			brilliant but vain, sensitive yet
			paranoid. I believe it is also
			capable of extreme acts of
			violence.

66   ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)

			So that's it...

					PICARD
				(lost in thought)
			Nothing. Go on.

					TROI
			It seems to have an especially
			strong hatred of you, Captain.
			Or to a lesser degree, any

				(pause)
			And worst of all, it's growing.

			How do you mean?

69   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - KAREEN (OPTICAL)

	is back at her favorite spot, eyeing the starry sky,

	ominous quality to it.

					DATA
			Hello Kareen.

	She turns, startled.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			You know who I am, don't you?

					KAREEN
			You're -- you're Data.

					DATA
			You know who I am. Don't you.

	Data moves forward until they're face to face. He is

	frightened. Still, there's a trace of hope in her
	eyes.

			It is me, Kareen! I'm here -- I'm

					KAREEN
			How?

					DATA
			The process worked! I turned Data
			off and transferred my

	Data steps back and proudly indicates his android
	body...

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Just look at me! Sleek, powerful,

	He grabs an object off the table. His face grows grim
	as he sends his mind back in time...

					DATA
				(continuing)
			When I was a boy, other children
			knew I couldn't match them
			physically. They teased me -- bullied
			me. That's when I
			withdrew... Became an island.

	He crushes the object, letting the rubble slip through
	his fingers.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			But no one will ever bully me

			I've never been capable of

	He turns his head as the door opens and Worf ENTERS
	with TWO SECURITY GUARDS.

					WORF
			Excuse me Data, but the captain
			would like to see you.

					DATA
			Of course.
				(to Kareen)
			If you will excuse me, Miss
			Brianon.

	Data begins to go with the three of them. Just as Worf
	turns his back, Data savagely fells him with a
	two-fisted blow to the back of the head. He grabs a
	phaser from the unconscious Klingon and points it at
	the security guards.

	One of the guards goes for his phaser -- Data fires
	right into his chest, taking him out. The other guard
	makes no such move.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			You're just the type, aren't you?
			You'd beat me up if you could,

	The guard is bewildered; he looks at Kareen
	questioningly.

					KAREEN
			Ira, no.

					DATA
			Stay out of it!
				(to Guard)
			You're lucky I'm such a

	delighted. He moves to Kareen -- she takes a step back
	and looks at him with alarm in her eyes.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			There's something I must do -- something
			they're forcing me to
			do. I'll come for you when my
			task is complete.

					KAREEN
				(voice trembling)
			Ira... I don't understand...
			what's happening to you?

	He takes her hand in his. She doesn't resist.

					DATA
			Something wonderful. I feel no
			pain, no pain at all! And I'm
			immortal -- I'll never have to
			face death again. Think of the
			things I'll accomplish over the
			next thousand years!

	Kareen is horrified. Data sees her reaction but
	misreads it.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			I know what you're thinking, but
			there's no need to worry. I'll
			create an android body for you
			as well. We'll witness the end
			of infinity together.

	She begins to cry. Her tears have a curious effect on
	him; he loses some of his fiery bravado and becomes
	softer and more sensitive.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Don't cry, Kareen.
				(pause, concerned)
			Don't you see, I can love you now.
			The way I've always wanted to.
			It wouldn't have been right
			then... I was too old for you,
			too weak. But now I can be
			everything you've ever wanted.

	She grimaces and tries to pull away.

					KAREEN
			Ira -- you're hurting me!

	He's shocked to find he's unconsciously squeezing her
	hand. He lets go, realizing he could have broken it
	into a hundred pieces. Kareen cradles her wounded hand
	-- Data stares at his own hand in dull horror. His
	action seems to have taken the wind out of his sails.
	He leans over and gently wipes a tear from her cheek.

					DATA
				(softly, dazed)
			I'll be back. Wait for me.

	As he exits, he looks at the three downed men with a
	touch of alarm. Did I really do that? He carefully
	steps around them, takes one last look at Kareen, and
	EXITS.

	Kareen goes to Worf, who is GROANING, just beginning to
	revive.

					WORF
			Ohhh, what hit me?

	The doors open and Riker and Picard ENTER, rushing to
	Kareen and Worf.

					RIKER
			Did Data do this?

					KAREEN
				(nodding)
			But it's not really Data.

					PICARD
			Yes. I realize that now.

	Picard addresses the com panel.

					PICARD
				(into com)
			Security alert -- all decks.
			Lieutenant Commander Data may be armed and
			dangerous. Use extreme caution
			and subdue. All phasers on stun.

70   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - GEORDI AT COMMAND

	Troi beside him, Wesley at Conn, the rest are N.D.
	CREWMEMBERS. The turbolift doors open and Data steps
	out brandishing a phaser.

					DATA
			Well hello there. You all look
			like you could use a little
			vacation.

71   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PULASKI (OPTICAL)

	has arrived and is treating and reviving the security
	guards. Picard and Riker are helping Worf to his feet
	when the viewscreen activates. We see Data holding a
	phaser to Geordi's head.

					DATA
			Captain Picard -- I have ordered
			your people to vacate the bridge
			and they have refused. In an
			effort to save insignificant lives
			I will give you the opportunity
			to issue the same order.
			Otherwise, I will remove them my
			way.

					RIKER
				(softly, to Picard)
			That phaser's set to kill,
			Captain.

					PICARD
			Data. That's your best friend
			you're threatening. That's
			Geordi. You wouldn't harm him
			for the world, would you?

	Data looks at Geordi and begins to soften. It becomes
	clear that there is a struggle going on inside him.

					DATA
				(uncertain)
			Geordi?

					GEORDI
			Yes Data. It's me.

	For a moment it looks like Data is about to release
	him. Then something kicks in and he violently presses
	the phaser against Geordi's head again.

					DATA
			He's no friend of mine! I should
			kill him on the spot -- put him
			out of his blind misery.

71   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			You win -- no need to act rashly.
			Mister La Forge, you and the rest
			of the bridge crew will vacate
			immediately.

					DATA
			I'll blast anyone who attempts
			to reenter.

					PICARD
			You will make no attempt to
			recapture the bridge. Is that
			clear, Geordi?

					GEORDI
			Yes sir. Evacuating now.

	Data seems to think about it before letting Geordi move
	OFF SCREEN. Suddenly there's an evil glint in his eye.

					DATA
			Maybe I should shoot one in the
			back just to let you know I mean
			business.

	There's a horrible, helpless moment of silence as
	Picard and company watch Data take aim on someone about
	to exit.

					PICARD
			What is it you want? Tell me!

	Data grins and deliberately begins to squeeze the
	trigger.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Kareen is with us! You want to
			talk to Kareen.

	Slowly Data lowers the gun and turns to face Picard.

					DATA
			Kareen? Are you there?

	Picard motions with his head for Kareen to approach the
	viewscreen.

					KAREEN
			Yes -- yes Ira. I'm here.

	Once again Data goes through a radical mood change. He
	becomes somber, paranoid.

71   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			They're all against me, Kareen.
			They want to drive me out of this
			body. To kill me!

	Kareen looks to Picard and Riker, uncertain of how to
	react.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			We're going to a new world, my
			darling. A place where no one
			can ever touch us. Just hang on,
			and trust in me.

	The viewscreen goes dead. Riker tries to reactivate
	it...

					RIKER
			Riker to bridge, Riker to bridge.
				(pause, to Picard)
			It's no good. He deactivated the
			monitor.

	Picard grimly looks at the frightened girl, trying to
	figure a way to recapture the bridge.

72   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - LATER - PICARD

	has convened an emergency meeting. Troi, Wesley,
	Geordi, Worf, Riker, Pulaski, and Kareen attending.

					PULASKI
			We must remember that we're
			dealing with an unhealthy mind,
			ravaged by Varnay's disease as
			well as the strain of assimilating
			into a new body.

					WORF
			And that "unhealthy mind" is in
			total control of this ship.

					GEORDI
			Yet he seems to have a purpose.
			He said something about going to
			a new world.

					RIKER
				(to Kareen)
			Do you know what he meant by that?

	She shakes her head.

72   CONTINUED:

					TROI
				(to Kareen)
			Is there anything you can tell
			us about Ira Graves that will help
			us to understand?

					KAREEN
				(distraught)
			He's a wonderful man. He's not
			like this --

					PICARD
			-- He's taken over my ship! And
			I want her back!
				(pause)
			Are you going to help me?

					KAREEN
			How can I help?

					PICARD
			By rejecting him! By deflating
			his ego.

					TROI
			Yes, he said he was doing this
			for you. Saying you want nothing
			to do with him might distract him
			long enough --

					KAREEN
			-- I won't hurt him! He's sick,
			I won't help to destroy him.

					PICARD
			It might be our only hope! He
			controls all life-support systems
			on this ship. He could start
			killing us like flies.

					KAREEN
				(yelling, distraught)
			I can't do it, don't you
			understand?

	Picard leans back in his chair. He slowly nods his
	head...

					PICARD
			Yes, I suppose I do understand.

	The captain rises.

72   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			Where are you going, Captain?

					PICARD
				(grim, determined)
			To the bridge.

					RIKER
			I can't let you do that, sir.

					PICARD
			You have no choice, Number One.
			Should I fail to return I want
			you to attempt an external bridge
			separation. Get all of our people
			as far away from him as possible.

					PULASKI
			You can't just walk in on him!
			He won't hesitate to kill you.

					PICARD
			There's still some of Data inside.
			I know there is. If I can reach
			him, maybe we've still got a
			chance.

73   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DATA (OPTICAL)

	sits at Command, watching the viewscreen, phaser in
	hand. He spins as the turbolift doors open, and fires
	a shot that barely misses Picard's head.

	The captain stands there calmly, then slowly walks onto
	the bridge.

					DATA
			I could've killed you. You know
			that, don't you?

					PICARD
			I do know that. I also know you
			haven't killed anyone so far.
			I don't think you really want to.

	Data doesn't say anything; he simply watches the
	captain through narrowed eyes. Picard indicates the
	viewscreen.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Where are we going?

           STAR TREK: "Schizoid Man" - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE          62.

73   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			To the Aldebaran system. There's
			a planet there that suits my
			purpose.

					PICARD
			Which is?

					DATA
			Why should I tell you?

					PICARD
			Because you're lonely. Because
			you want someone else to share
			your plans.

					DATA
			I'll tell you... because I'm
			bored. I plan on building a
			fortress, with a laboratory of
			course. Those of your crew that
			I do not exterminate shall live
			there as our slaves. Kareen will
			never want for anything.

					PICARD
			And what of Data? Your
			"grandson."

					DATA
				(chuckles)
			What of him?

					PICARD
			You took advantage of him.

	Data angrily rises and moves toward Picard.

					DATA
			I did him a favor! I gave him
			life!

					PICARD
			You killed him! You're nothing
			but a two-bit murderer!

	Data lunges at Picard and grabs his throat with both
	hands. Picard strains to free himself but the android
	hands are incredibly strong. Picard is beginning to
	turn blue.

					DATA
			You call me a murderer?! I'll
			show you what murder is.

73   CONTINUED: (2)

	Picard is gasping for air -- on his last legs.

					KAREEN (O.S.)
				(screaming)
			Stop it!

	Surprised, Data turns, releasing his grip. Kareen
	steps onto the bridge...

					KAREEN)
				(continuing)
			You've become a monster.

					DATA
				(worried, nervous)
			Don't say that, Kareen. He
			attacked me --

					KAREEN
			-- And a liar as well.

	Breathing hard, Picard watches as she goes up to Data
	with fire in her eyes...

					KAREEN
				(continuing)
			I hate you. I despise you.

					DATA
				(shocked, weak)
			Kareen... don't...

					KAREEN
			You're not a man anymore! You're
			a pathetic little pile of
			machinery!

					DATA
			Stop... please...

					KAREEN
			The thought of ever living with
			something like you makes me sick.

	Data is weakening by the moment. The fury of her
	verbal assault is bringing out all of his insecurities
	and paranoia, making him a basket case.

					KAREEN
				(continuing)
			I'd rather live alone! I'd rather
			make love to a computer!

	Data is overcome by a moment of pure fury. He hauls
	back and prepares to slap her...

					KAREEN
				(continuing)
			Are you going to kill me too?

	The thought of what he was about to do terrifies Data.
	His hands begin to shake, he bows his head in nervous
	shame...

					DATA
			You hate me... What can I do, what
			can I do?

					KAREEN
			Leave that body. It doesn't
			belong to you.

	Data looks her in the eye. He is emotionally
	devastated. He gives her just the ghost of a smile (is
	he relieved?) and then hurries to the turbolift.

	Alone with Kareen, the recovering Picard gives her a
	hug. We can see by her eyes that this experience was
	just as devastating for her. Her hatred was a forced
	hatred.

76   REVERSE ANGLE

	on the inert form of Data lying by the computer
	terminal. Riker is the first to reach him, shaking his
	limp form by the collar.

					RIKER
			Data! Data, can you hear me?

	Data's eyes pop open. They are clear and inquisitive
	-- we sense it's the old Data once again.

76   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			May I ask you a question,
			Commander?

	Riker smiles up at the others. He happily senses the
	same thing.

					RIKER
			I think you just did.

					DATA
			Quite correct. May I ask you
			another question after this one?

					RIKER
			No questions. Just tell me a
			joke. The funniest joke in
			history.

					DATA
			All right. There were twelve...
			starship captains, sitting on a
			fence --

77   CLOSE ON PICARD

	his eyebrows arching in surprise.

					PICARD
			-- I've heard more than enough
			to know you're you again.

	Data has no idea what that means. As the others help
	the android to his feet, Picard notices that Kareen is
	standing away from the others, staring at the computer
	terminal. He goes to see what she sees...

78   ANGLE ON COMPUTER VIEWSCREEN

	It simply reads: "GOOD-BYE KAREEN. I'M SORRY."

	Picard puts his hand on her shoulder...

					KAREEN
				(sad half-whisper)
			He's in there. Ira put himself
			in the computer.

					PICARD
			No Kareen. The real Ira Graves
			never left the planet.
