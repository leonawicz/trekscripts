	FADE IN:

1    INT. QUARK'S

	The usual crowd, perhaps just a bit lighter. BASHIR
	and EZRI are seated at a table, laughing amiably and
	innocently enjoying each other's company.

					QUARK (O.S.)
			Have you ever seen anything so
			disgusting?

	ADJUST TO REVEAL QUARK and ODO at the bar, watching
	the doctor and the counselor.

					QUARK
			The way he's undressing her with
			his eyes... and look at his
			hands!

					ODO
			What about them?

					QUARK
			Those gestures -- they're
			obscene. You should arrest him.

					ODO
			You can't be serious...

					QUARK
				(re: Bashir)
			He's pitiful. Doesn't he realize
			she loves me?

					ODO
			Actually, I don't think he
			does... and to be perfectly
			frank, I don't think she does
			either.

					QUARK
				(dismissive)
			Oh, what do you know -- you don't
			even recognize an obscene hand
			gesture when you see one.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER     2.

1    CONTINUED:

					ODO
			Maybe not. But I recognize
			deluded fool when I see one..
				(looking directly at
				Quark)
			... and I'm seeing one now.

					QUARK
			Thanks for the support.

1A   NEW ANGLE

	as an agitated ROM rushes into the bar.

					ROM
			Brother! I just talked to
			Moogie. She says Grand Nagus Zek
			has disappeared.

					QUARK
			What do you mean, "disappeared?"

	Quark's attention is still mainly focused on Bashir
	and Ezri.

					ROM
			He left her a note saying he was
			going on a business safari to
			open new territories for
			financial exploitation.

					QUARK
			That's our Nagus.

					ROM
			He said held be back in five days
			-- that was twelve days ago!

	That gets Quark's full attention.

					QUARK
			Twelve days?

					ODO
			Has he done this before?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER    2A.

1A   CONTINUED:

					ROM
			Not for this long.
				(to Odo)
			Moogie did some checking -- no
			one's heard from him. He could
			be hurt -- or even dead. We have
			to do something!

					QUARK
			He probably stopped off on Risa --
			you know, for a little rest and
			relaxation.

					ROM
				(shocked)
			Risa? With all those gorgeous
			women... he wouldn't do that to
			Moogie!

					QUARK
			Have you looked at our mother
			lately? She's not getting any
			younger.
				(a beat)
			Now do us both a favor and stop
			worrying about Zek. He'll show
			up.

					ROM
			Are you sure?

					QUARK
			Good-bye, Rom.

	And with that, Rom EXITS and Quark turns his
	attention back to Bashir and Ezri. But to his
	surprise they're nowhere to be seen.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER    2B.

1A   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
				(alarmed)
			Where'd Ezri go?

					ODO
			She slipped out the back. With
			Doctor Bashir.

					QUARK
				(appalled)
			They left together?

	Quark looks at Odo, trying to figure out if the
	changeling is pulling his leg.

					ODO
				(nodding, amused)
			I believe they were holding
			hands.

	And off Quark's look of consternation --

2    INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS

	Later that night. CLOSE ON a latinum bust of a
	venerable-looking Ferengi being ceremoniously set on
	a table. Adjust to reveal Quark in nightclothes.

					QUARK
			Blessed Exchequer, whose greed is
			eternal... whose wealth is as vast as
			the cosmos...

	Quark turns his back to the bust so as not to be
	seen by it, and takes out several slips of latinum
	from a box on the table. After a momentary thought,
	he takes two of the slips and returns the rest to
	his pocket. He turns back to the bust, offering it
	his best sycophantic smile --

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER     3   

2    CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			Allow this humble bribe to open
			your ears and hear this plea from
			your most devout debtor.

	Quark then places the two slips into the Exchequer's
	ear.

					QUARK
			Continue to bless my bar with a
			steady stream of thirsty
			customers whose pockets are lined
			with latinum and whose skills at
			dabo are shaky at best...

	Quark leans forward to whisper another request in
	the bust's ear.

					QUARK
			And while you're at it, see if
			there's anything you can do about
			Doctor Bashir... don't hurt him
			or anything, just get him off the
			station for a couple of months.
			Oh, and one other thing...

	Quark reaches into the box and takes out two more
	slips of latinum which he places in the bust's ear.

					QUARK
			I opened "negotiations" with Ezri
			three months ago, but I can't
			seem to close the deal. Anything
			you can do --

	He then places one last slip of latinum into the
	blessed ear. Just then the door CHIMES.

3    NEW ANGLE

	as Quark covers the bust with a cloth before going
	to answer the door.

					QUARK
			Come in.

4    ANGLE ON THE DOOR

	as it OPENS to reveal Ezri, dressed in Road-Warrior
	black.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER     4.

4    CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(with happy surprise)
			Ezri...

	But as Quark turns back to Ezri, she grabs him by
	the collar and throws him up against the wall.

					EZRI
			Anyone else here?

					QUARK
			Just you and me.

	Ezri twists his arm and pushes him forward.

					EZRI
				(indicating the only
				other door)
			Is that the bedroom?

	Quark nods and his eyes light up -- it looks like
	his fantasy is about to come true.

					QUARK
				(to the bust)
			I owe you.

	Ezri keeps the pressure on Quark's arm.

					QUARK
			Does it have to be so rough the
			first time?

	Ezri shoves Quark face-first into the wall and takes
	out a long knife.

					EZRI
			I don't know what you think is
			going on here... but think again.

					QUARK
				(disappointed)
			Don't tell me this is some new
			kind of therapy? Am I suppose to
			start talking about my childhood
			or something?

					EZRI
			I hope not.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER     5.

4    CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
			Good, because I'd rather talk
			about us. Dax -- you're the most
			fascinating woman I've ever met
			I love you. There -- I said it!

					EZRI
			My name's not Dax.

					QUARK
			Oh, I get it. Your clothes...
			the knife... this aggressive
			attitude... it's all role-
			playing.
				(getting an idea)
			Call me Shmun.

					EZRI
			Shmun?

					QUARK
			And I'll call you T'lana -- you
			know, from "Vulcan Love Slave"
			Volume Three.

					EZRI
			You're a very confused man,
			aren't you?

	Ezri lets go of Quark, steps back and sheathes her
	knife.

					EZRI
			If your friend Zek is depending
			on you, he's in bigger trouble
			than he thinks.

					QUARK
			Zek? What does he have to do
			with any of this?

	Ezri takes out an isolinear rod.

					EZRI
			I'll let him explain.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER     6.

4    CONTINUED:	(3)

	She then places the rod in Quark's monitor.

5    ANGLE ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	as the face of GRAND NAGUS ZEK fills the screen.
	(Note: When Zek speaks, it should be clear this is a
	recorded message and not a two-way communication.)

					ZEK
				(on the monitor)
			Hello, Quark -- it's me. Your
			Grand Nagus. You'll never guess
			where I am.

					QUARK
			Risa?

					ZEK
			If you said Risa -- guess again.
			I'm in the Alternate Universe!

	Quark looks over at Ezri.

					QUARK
			You're not Ezri -- you're from
			over there.

               EZRI                                 ZEK
     You're catching on.                  You're probably wondering
                                          how I got here

					ZEK
			... well, you're going to have to
			keep on wondering, because I don't
			have time to tell you. You see,
			I'm in a bit of trouble. I'm
			being held prisoner by the
			Alliance and I'm going to need
			you to help me regain my freedom.
			The Regent is willing to send me
			home in exchange for a ship's
			cloaking device.
				(a beat)

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER   7-8.

5    CONTINUED:

					ZEK (Cont'd)
			They don't have them in this
			universe. If only I'd known that
			before I got here... I could've
			saved myself a lot of aggravation
			and made a nice profit at the
			same time. Oh, well...
				(back to business)
			My fate is in your hands, Quark.
			I need a cloaking device and I
			need it now. You're the only one
			I can count on. Do this for me
			and I promise I'll be eternally
			grateful. And don't forget to
			tell your mother I love her. Good-bye.

	And with that, the screen goes dark.

6    WIDER

					QUARK
				(more to himself)
			He should've gone to Risa...

					EZRI
			The Regent wants the cloaking
			device in three days.

					QUARK
			That's not much time. Cloaking
			technology isn't easy to come by.

					EZRI
			You'll find a way...

					QUARK
			And if I don't?

					EZRI
				(simple)
			The Nagus will die.

	And as Quark considers her words, we:

								FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)

7    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)

	to see a Klingon Bird of Prey docked at the station.

8    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	As the airlock door OPENS and Quark pokes his head
	out, looking up and down the corridor.

					ROM (0.S.)
			Anyone out there?

					QUARK
			Not that I can see.

					ROM (0.S)
			Then let's do it.

	Quark hesitates, then reluctantly his head
	disappears back inside the airlock.

					QUARK (O.S.)
			All right, together now -- lift!

	We hear Quark and Rom GRUNTING with effort as they
	lift an object.

					ROM (0. S.)
			It's heavy...

					QUARK (O.S.)
			I noticed.

	Quark leads the way out down the steps leading into
	the corridor. Rom follows. They strain under the
	heavy load they're carrying. Just what it is
	they're holding, we can't see. Why? Because it's
	invisible. That's right... they're carrying a
	cloaked cloaking device.

					QUARK
			Watch the steps...

					ROM
				(looking down)
			I see them, brother.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   10.

9    NEW ANGLE

	as they slowly inch their way down the corridor.

					ROM
			I told you cloaking the cloaking
			device was a good idea.

					QUARK
				(straining)
			Brilliant. But couldn't you have
			done something about its weight?

					ROM
				(seriously
				considering the
				notion)
			Uh... nope. But if it makes you
			feel any better, the cloaking
			device on the Defiant is a lot
			heavier.

					QUARK
			Tell that to my hernia.

					ROM
			You know what's bothering me...
			it seems wrong to be stealing a
			cloaking device for the Alliance.

					QUARK
			We're not stealing it for them,
			we're stealing it to save Zek.

					ROM
			But what about this other Ezri?
			She's a Trill.

					QUARK
			So?

					ROM
			So shouldn't she be with the
			rebels fighting against the
			Alliance?

					QUARK
				(dry)
			Be sure to point that out when
			you meet her. Just don't forget,
			she carries a knife.

	Suddenly Quark stops in his tracks --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE  10A.

9    CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(listening)
			Shh. Someone's coming...

	They both listen to something we can't hear.

					QUARK
				(re: the cloaking
				device)
			Quick -- put it down!

	Rom instantly lets go of the device, which then
	slips out of Quark's grasp and lands on the floor
	with a THUD.

					QUARK
			Act normal.

	Quark and Rom rush over to the bulkhead which they
	pretend to study with great curiosity, just as
	CAPTAIN SISKO and GENERAL MARTOK come into view.

					MARTOK
			I'm telling you, captain --
			we have to find a way to expand
			our lines beyond the Kalandra
			System.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   11.

9    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			I agree. If we don't move soon,
			the ionic storms will isolate our
			positions.

	Sisko and Martok pass by Quark and Rom, still
	studiously examining the bulkhead.

					MARTOK
			And allow the Dominion to flank
			us.

	Suddenly, Sisko and Martok are struck by the same
	thought -- what are those Ferengis doing?

					SISKO
			Something wrong, gentlemen?

					QUARK
				(thinking fast)
			It's the bulkhead.

					MARTOK
			What about it?

					QUARK
			Rom's thinking about painting his
			quarters this color.

					SISKO
			They already are that color.

					QUARK
				(to Rom)
			I told you!

					ROM
			No wonder I like it.
				(to Sisko)
			It's a very soothing shade of
			gray.

					SISKO
			Glad you approve.

	And with that, Martok and Sisko make their way up
	the steps into the Airlock.

10   ANGLE ON QUARK AND ROM (OPTICAL)

	No sooner do Sisko and Martok EXIT, than Quark and
	Rom face each other in panic.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   12.

10   CONTINUED:

					ROM
			They're going into the Klingon
			ship! What if they discover the
			cloaking device is missing?

					QUARK
			Let's get out of here!

	They both turn and look -- but of course, they can't
	see the cloaking device.

					QUARK
			Where is it?

					ROM
			I'm not sure.

					QUARK
			Well, find it.

	They bend over and start groping around the corridor
	for it, flailing their arms about. Suddenly Quark's
	hand touches something that ZAPS him with an
	electrical charge.

					QUARK
			Oww!

					ROM
				(gleeful)
			Good job, brother. But I
			wouldn't touch those induction
			coils if I were you.

					QUARK
				(dry)
			Thanks for the warning.

	They position themselves to once again lift the
	device.

					ROM
			Up we go...

	With a GRUNT, they lift their burden.

					QUARK
			C'mon! Ezri's waiting in Cargo
			Bay Fourteen.

	After a few difficult steps, something occurs to
	Rom.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   13.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ROM
			Brother -- I just thought of
			something...

					QUARK
			Not now.

					ROM
			It's just...

					QUARK
				(annoyed, giving in)
			Just what?

					ROM
			Isn't Cargo Bay Fourteen the
			other way?

	Quark and Rom stop for a beat, look at each other
	silently, then begin moving in the opposite
	direction.

11   INT. DEEP SPACE NINE - CARGO BAY FOURTEEN

	Ezri is running her multidimensional transporter
	unit over the console of a transporter pad.

11	ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	As Rom's hand taps some keys on the invisible
	cloaking device. A moment later it DECLOAKS.

12   WIDER

	to see Rom and Quark standing on the transporter pad
	with the now-visible cloaking device.

					EZRI
				(re: the cloaking
				device)
			As soon as I give that to the
			Regent, he'll release Zek.

					QUARK
			Then what happens?

					EZRI
			Then you get him back.

	Rom gazes intently at Ezri.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE  13A.

12   CONTINUED:

					EZRI
			Would you stop doing that?

					ROM
			Doing what?

					EZRI
			Staring at me.

					ROM
			Sorry. But you look just like
			our Ezri, except you're a lot
			taller.

					QUARK
			What are you talking about?
			She's exactly the same height!

					ROM
			I don't think so...

					QUARK
			Don't be an idiot. I'm telling
			you they're identical.

					EZRI
			Do I have to throw you off that

					ROM
			How do we know the Regent will
			keep his word and send Zek back
			to us?

					EZRI
			You don't. But there's not much
			you can do about it, is there?

					ROM
			Yes, there is.
				(to Quark)
			Brother, I think we should go
			with her.

					QUARK
			I was afraid you were going to
			say that...

					EZRI
				(a warning)
			I don't think you'd like it on
			the other side...

					QUARK
			That, I believe.
				(steeling himself)
			But my idiot brother is right --
			we're coming with you.

	Just then, the Cargo Bay doors OPEN to reveal a very
	angry Martok.

					MARTOK
			Ferengis -- I'll have you hanging
			by your ears.

					QUARK
				(to Ezri)
			Well, what are we waiting for?

	And with that --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   15.

13   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Ezri doesn't want them along but has no choice but
	to tap her transporter unit and the three of them,
	along with the cloaking device, DEMATERIALIZE.

14   INT. TEROK NOR - CARGO BAY FOURTEEN (OPTICAL)

	Quark, Rom, Ezri and the cloaking device MATERIALIZE
	on the transporter pad.

					ROM
			It didn't work...

					EZRI
			Yes it did. We're on Terok Nor.

					ROM
				(puzzled)
			It looks like Deep Space Nine to
			me.

					QUARK
			I suppose a cargo bay is a cargo
			bay no matter what universe you're in.

					ROM
			But this is an alternate
			universe. Shouldn't everything
			be different?

					QUARK
			It's different enough. Remember
			what Captain Sisko once told us --
			in this universe, we're both
			dead.

					ROM
			That's so sad. I would've liked
			to meet myself.

					EZRI
			We better get moving. I've got a
			ship waiting for us at Landing
			Pad "C."

					ROM
			What's the rush?

					EZRI
			This is a rebel base and we're
			working for the Alliance.

	But as they step off the Transporter pad --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   16.

15   ANGLE ON THE CARGO BAY DOORS (OPTICAL)

	bursting OPEN to reveal VIC FONTAINE, dressed in
	rebel attire, a phaser in each hand, backing into
	the room as he BLASTS away at some unseen pursuers.

					ROM
			Vic?

	Vic whirls around and points his phasers at the
	Ferengis.

					VIC
			I thought you two were dead...

					ROM
				(happy to confirm the truth)
			We are!

					QUARK
				(to Vic)
			You're not a hologram...

					VIC
			A what?

16   ANGLE ON THE DOOR

	as CAPTAIN BASHIR and some REBEL N.D.s ENTER.

					BASHIR
			Fontaine -- put down those
			phasers!

17   ANGLE ON VIC (OPTICAL)

	as he spins --

					VIC
			I'll see you in hell first.

	-- then FIRES at Bashir.

18   ANGLE ON EZRI

	as she grabs Quark and Rom and pushes them out of
	harm's way. This is not their fight.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE   17.

19   ON BASHIR (OPTICAL)

	as he and the N.D.s duck for cover and return FIRE.

20   ON VIC (OPTICAL)

	catching a fatal phaser BLAST in the chest.

21   ANGLE ON QUARK AND ROM

	crouched behind some cargo crates as Vic's body
	falls alongside them. They stare into his vacant
	eyes.

					QUARK
			I don't believe it... Julian just
			shot Vic Fontaine.

					ROM
			I thought Vic was his favorite

				(a beat)
			No wonder they call it the

22   INT. TEROK NOR - CARGO BAY FOURTEEN

	As before, Quark and Rom are crouched near Vic's
	body. Ezri is nearby.

					BASHIR (O.S.)
			You, behind the crates -- come
			out. Now!

	Quark and Rom look to Ezri, who calmly nods.

					EZRI
			Do as he says.

23   WIDER

	as Quark and the others step out from their cover.
	They are met by Bashir and the N.D.s who keep their
	weapons on them.

					BASHIR
			Well, well... look who we have
			here.

					QUARK
			I'll bet you're surprised to see
			us... but I can explain --

	But Bashir doesn't seem interested in his
	explanation. Instead, he strides up to Ezri.

					BASHIR
			You worthless piece of space trash.

	With the back of his hand he SLAPS her across the
	face.

					QUARK
				(instinctively)
			Leave her alone!

	Quark makes a move towards Bashir but he doesn't get
	very far before one of the REBELS knocks him over
	the head with the butt of a phaser rifle. Quark is
	out cold.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO  18A.

23   CONTINUED:

					ROM
				(puzzled, to Bashir)
			Hey, you're supposed to be the
			good guys...

	As if in answer, the rebels turn their weapons on
	Rom, who sheepishly holds up his hands.

					ROM
			My mistake...

24   INT. TEROK NOR - HOLDING CELLS

	CLOSE ON Quark rubbing the back of his head. ADJUST
	to include Rom and Ezri, in the same cell. Bashir
	and CAPTAIN SMILEY O'BRIEN stare at them from the
	other side of the forcefield.

					ROM
				(to Smiley and
				Bashir)
			-- but you don't understand, you
			have to give us back the cloaking
			device -- we need it to rescue
			the Nagus.

					BASHIR
			That's not who you should be
			worried about right now. You
			know what we do to Alliance
			sympathizers?

					O'BRIEN
			Give it a rest, Julian.

					BASHIR
			I'll give it a rest... as soon as
			these three get what's coming to
			them.

					ROM
				(to Quark)
			I don't know about you, but I
			like our Bashir better.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Quark and Rom,
				re: Bashir)
			You have to forgive him.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO  18B.

24   CONTINUED:
					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)
			He's had a rough go of it lately.
			Lost a close friend in a skirmish
			with some Alliance troops.

					BASHIR
				(defensive)
			This isn't about Jadzia. Do you
			know what would happen to us if
			the Alliance got its hands on a
			cloaking device?

					O'BRIEN
			It wouldn't be pretty.

					BASHIR
			They could wipe us out in a
			matter of weeks!
				(looking at Ezri)
			Besides, there's nothing I loathe
			more than traitors.

					EZRI
			I'm not a traitor.

					O'BRIEN
			She's right.
				(to Ezri)
			You have to believe in something
			before you can betray it. And
			you don't believe in anything.

					EZRI
			I believe in getting paid for my
			work -- and you still owe me for
			the last job I did for you.

					O'BRIEN
			We're fighting for our freedom
			here... for our very lives. And
			all you care about is money?

					EZRI
			Like you said, you've got to
			believe in something.

					BASHIR
			Let me ram those words down her
			throat.

	Bashir looks ready to charge right through the
	forcefield to get at Ezri, but O'Brien restrains
	him.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   19.

24   CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			You're forgetting something,
			Julian. The Alliance didn't get
			the cloaking device, we did. And
			that gives us the edge...
				(re: the Ferengis)
			And we have these gentlemen to
			thank for it.

					BASHIR
			What do you want to do -- give
			them medals?

	O'Brien takes a step towards Quark and Rom.

					O'BRIEN
			I don't think your Captain Sisko
			would be too pleased to know that
			you were over here interfering
			with our affairs.

					ROM
			That's why we didn't tell him.

					O'BRIEN
			I suspected as much...
				(to Bashir, re: the
				Ferengis)
			I say we send the Ferengis back
			to their universe. Let Sisko
			deal with them.

					QUARK
			We can't go back. Not without
			Zek.

					O'BRIEN
			The way I see it, you've got two
			choices. You can either go back
			where you belong or you can head
			for Alliance territory and try to
			rescue your friend without the
			cloaking device.
				(a beat)
			You have 'til morning to decide.

					BASHIR
				(to Ezri)
			Either way -- you're staying with
			us.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   20.

24   CONTINUED:	(3)

	And with that, O'Brien and Bashir EXIT. We hold on
	Rom looking at Ezri sympathetically.

					ROM
			Tough break.

					EZRI
			I'll live.

					QUARK
			You sure?

					EZRI
			Don't worry about me. But
			Smiley's right about one thing
			if you're found in Alliance
			territory without the cloaking
			device, you're dead.

					QUARK
			Are you suggesting we go back
			home?

					EZRI
			It's the smart move.

	Quark and Rom exchange a grim look, but after a
	beat, they steel their resolve. Quark looks over to
	Ezri.

					QUARK
			Do we look smart to you?

	And off this moment --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   21.

5    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) 

	To establish the Klingon flagship. (The same one we
	saw in "Shattered Mirror," only with a couple
	million kilometers more on the odometer.)

6    INT. KLINGON HOLDING CELL

	CLOSE on GRAND NAGUS ZEK, his eyes closed, his head
	resting on a black leather-clad lap, while a
	feminine hand is gently rubbing his ear lobes.

					ZEK
			My dear, you have such nimble
			fingers.

	ADJUST to include the INTENDANT -- she of the
	leather-clad lap -- concentrating on giving Zek the
	best oo-mox of his life. MAIHAR'DU is standing in
	the holding cell with them, embarrassed to be
	witnessing this intimate moment between his Nagus
	and the Intendant.

					INTENDANT
				(re: her fingers)
			How many times have I heard
			that...

					ZEK
			I don't think I could survive
			this incarceration without them.

					INTENDANT
			I'm so glad I could be of help.

					ZEK
			I only wish I could return the
			favor. After all, you've been
			suffering here a lot longer than
			I have.

					INTENDANT
			Oh, it hasn't been too bad. I
			always find a way to amuse
			myself. Besides, the worst is
			almost over... as soon as your
			people bring the Regent the
			cloaking device, we'll both be
			free.

					ZEK
				(more to himself)
			If Quark and Rom don't screw
			things up...


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   22.

26   CONTINUED:

	With a flash of anger, the Intendant twists his ear
	viciously. Zek SCREAMS, sitting up to rub his ear.

26A  ANGLE ON MAIHAR'DU

	as he moves toward the Intendant, determined to
	protect his Nagus. But the Hupyrian is no match for
	the Intendant, who knees him in the groin.

					INTENDANT
			Have a seat, lover boy.

	Maihar'du -- all seven feet of him -- scrunches in
	silent pain and he slowly sinks out of frame.

					INTENDANT
				(to Zek, re: Maihar'du)
			Fragile isn't he?
				(all business)
			You said your people could
			deliver the cloaking device. You
			guaranteed it.

					ZEK
			So I did. And so they shall.

					INTENDANT
				(suddenly all
				sweetness and
				light)
			Then we have nothing to worry
			about.

	Then Intendant sits back down and rests Zek's head
	back into her lap.

					ZEK
			That's quite a temper you have,
			my dear.

					INTENDANT
			It's one of my best features.
			Now where were we?

	She begins rubbing his lobes again.

					ZEK
			You mind tugging at my ear hairs
			again?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   23.

26A  CONTINUED:

28   INT. TEROK NOR - HOLDING CELLS

	CLOSE ON Rom, curled up into a ball on one side of
	the cell bench, snoring softly. ADJUST to include
	Quark and Ezri, seated side-by-side. Quark is lost
	in thought, his mind working a mile a minute.

					QUARK
				(more to himself)
			We have to find a way out of
			here.

					EZRI
				(unconcerned)
			And then?

					QUARK
			Then we get our hands on the
			cloaking device and finish what
			we started.

					EZRI
			All right. Let's say you manage
			to save this Grand Nagus of
			yours. Then what?

					QUARK
			Then we go home. And never come
			back here again.

					EZRI
			That's it?

					QUARK
			Isn't it enough?

					EZRI
			Quark, don't play dumb with me.
			You're risking your life for him
			-- there has to be a reason.

					QUARK
			He's the Nagus. The man my
			mother loves.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO  23A.

28   CONTINUED:

					QUARK (Cont'd)
			Not to mention, the head of the
			Ferengi Alliance.

					EZRI
			In other words, he's rich.

					QUARK
			They don't come any richer.

					EZRI
			I see. How much do you expect to
			get out of him?

					QUARK
			Knowing the Nagus... I'd say a
			pat on the head and a fistful of
			empty promises.

	Now Ezri's puzzled again.

					EZRI
			I don't understand.

					QUARK
			There's nothing to understand.
			He's my Nagus. And when your
			Nagus gets in trouble, you're
			supposed to do something about it.

					EZRI
			Why?

					QUARK
				(thinks it over)
			I don't know... loyalty?

					EZRI
				(skeptical)
			You're kidding me, right? You're
			doing this out of loyalty?

					QUARK
			Would you stop looking at me like
			that -- you're making me feel
			like an idiot.

					EZRI
			I hope so.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   24.

28   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Suddenly, Rom sits up on the bench, startled.

					ROM
			Brother! I just realized
			something...

					EZRI
				(to Quark)
			This should be good.

					ROM
			This is suppose to be an
			alternate universe, but their
			Captain O'Brien seems as nice as
			our Chief O'Brien.

					QUARK
			So?

					ROM
			Don't you see? It doesn't make
			any sense! It's not "alternate"...

	Quark just stares at his brother for a beat.

					QUARK
			Go back to sleep, Rom.

					ROM
			Right.
				(to himself)
			But it's all very confusing...

29   NEW ANGLE

	as we suddenly hear a SCUFFLE coming from the next
	room.

					ROM
			What was that?

					QUARK
			How would I know?

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT TWO   25.

29   CONTINUED:

	Suddenly BRUNT, a phaser rifle in hand, comes
	striding into the room.

					ROM
				(fearful)
			Brother -- look out! It's Brunt!

	But Ezri shows no signs of alarm.

					QUARK
			I don't think that's our Brunt.

					EZRI
				(to Brunt)
			What took you so long?

	Brunt quickly moves over to the wall panel and
	starts working the control pad.

					BRUNT
				(good-humored)
			Sorry, but I've been a little
			busy... I had to break into the
			cargo bay, steal back the cloaking
			device you lost and get it onto our
			ship. And on top of that --

					EZRI
			Quit complaining and get us out
			of here.

					BRUNT
			I'm working on it.

30   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	as Brunt FIRES at the wall panel. The forcefield
	FRITZES OFF, allowing Quark, Rom, and Ezri out of
	the cell.

31   WIDER

	as Ezri gives Brunt a quick hug.

					BRUNT
				(to Quark and Rom)
			You two must be hungry. I've got
			food and drink waiting for you on
			the ship.

					ROM
				(to Quark)
			He's so thoughtful.

			Scary, isn't it?

	And with that, Quark and Rom follow Ezri and Brunt

33   INT. FERENGI SHIP

	Quark and Ezri are in the pilot seats, while Rom is
	behind them in the middle chair, eating from a bowl.
	We hear a low engine RUMBLE as the ship VIBRATES
	momentarily.

					QUARK
			What was that?

					EZRI
			Brunt modified the dilithium
			matrix to maximize the power
			output.

					QUARK
			He did, did he?

					EZRI
			He's a very good engineer.

					ROM
			He's also a very good cook.
			These fried tube grubs are
			delicious.

					QUARK
			Better hope he didn't poison
			them.

					ROM
			Maybe in our universe he'd do
			something like that -- but not
			over here. Over here,
			everything's "alternate" -- so
			he's a nice guy.
				(a sudden concern)
			Which means the tube grubs here
			should be poisonous, because
			they're not poisonous on our
			side.
				(thinking it through)

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  28.

33   CONTINUED:
					ROM (Cont'd)
			But if Brunt gave us poisonous

			because our Brunt isn't...

					QUARK
			Rom, you're driving me crazy.

					ROM
			It's not me, brother -- it's this
			alternate universe. It just
			doesn't make any sense.

	Brunt emerges from the back room carrying a tray of
	food.

					BRUNT
				(to Rom)
			More tube grubs?

					ROM
			Yes, please.
				(changing his mind)
			No.
				(a wild guess)
			Yes?

	Brunt hands him a bowl and places another one near
	Quark.

					BRUNT
				(to Quark)
			In case you get hungry.
				(to Ezri)
			I put a cup of hot tea by your

	Ezri stretches her back.

					EZRI
			It has been a long day...

					ROM
				(yawning)
			You're telling me.

	Ezri and Rom get out of their chairs. Rom quickly
	EXITS, off to catch a nap, as Ezri turns to look at
	Brunt.

					EZRI
			We're not due to rendezvous with
			the Regent's ship for another
			forty-six hours.

					BRUNT
				(dry)
			I'll wake you long before that.

	Ezri then heads for the back, as Brunt slips into
	the pilot's seat and begins working the console.

34   ANGLE ON QUARK

	as he studies Brunt for a beat.

					BRUNT
			I'd like to see the look on Bashir's
			face when he discovers we've stolen
			back the cloaking device.

					QUARK
			You think he and Smiley will come
			after us?

					BRUNT
				(nodding)
			They can't let the Regent get his
			hands on that technology.

					QUARK
			Sounds like your sympathies are
			with the rebels.

					BRUNT
				(simply)
			I hate the Alliance.

					QUARK
			Then why help them get the
			cloaking device?

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  30.

34   CONTINUED:

					BRUNT
			Ezri and I are partners. More
			than that... she's the closest
			friend I've ever had.

					QUARK
				(with a little edge)
			And just how close is that?

	Brunt suddenly understands what Quark is getting at.

					BRUNT
			Not as close as I'd like.

					QUARK
				(feigning sympathy)
			Too bad.

					BRUNT
			I'm not her type.
				(glancing at him)
			And I don't think you are either.

					QUARK
			What makes you say that?

	Brunt works his console a bit before answering.

					BRUNT
			Let's just say that when it comes
			to men, she's very particular.
			Now if you don't mind, I need to
			concentrate on remodulating the

	Worf then turns to his right-hand man, GARAK,
	standing nearby.

					WORF
			See if the Ferengi has any more of

					GARAK
			Certainly. But first, my Regent,
			I must talk to you about the

					WORF
			I will deal with the Intendant in

			But first, I want that cloaking

					BRUNT
			It's a little late to back out

42A  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	to see the very small Ferengi ship enter an open
	docking port on the overwhelming Klingon vessel.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  35.

43   INT. KLINGON FLAGSHIP - BRIDGE

	The Regent is standing by the Captain's Chair, his
	arms stretched out at his sides as TWO SERVANTS
	place open-fingered, studded gauntlets on his hands.
	Once the gloves are in place, he clenches his fist
	to test the comfort.

44   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the Regent looks around the room for an apt
	subject, his eyes coming upon one of the KLINGON
	WARRIORS.

					WORF
			You. Come here. Your Regent
			needs you.

	The Klingon dutifully obeys, standing before Worf.
	The Regent then rears back and punches him in the
	face. The Klingon goes down with a thud. The
	Regent flexes his gloved hand.

					WORF
			Nice fit.

45   NEW ANGLE

	as Garak ENTERS.

					GARAK
			Our visitors from the other
			universe are here... and I'm
			happy to report they're not 
			empty-handed.

	Garak gestures to someone off screen. Moments
	later, Quark, Ezri, Rom and Brunt ENTER, followed by
	another KLINGON carrying the cloaking device.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  36.

45A  ANGLE ON ROM

	who stares at the Regent with disbelief.

					ROM
			It can't be... look who the
			Regent is!

					QUARK
				(bigger problems on
				his mind)
			So?

					ROM
			So who's president of the
			Federation? Morn?

					QUARK
			There is no Federation here.

					WORF
			Is there a problem, Ferengi?

					QUARK
				(to Worf, re: Rom)
			Just ignore him. Now if you'll
			give us the Nagus... we'll be on
			our way and you can go on with
			your plans for mass destruction,
			genocide and all those other
			good things...

	But the Regent ignores Quark, concentrating on the
	cloaking device.

46   CLOSE ON WORF

	caressing it gleefully.

					WORF
			Victory is finally in my grasp.
				(to Garak)
			I want it operational within the
			hour.

					GARAK
			And so it shall be, exalted one.

					QUARK
				(sensing trouble)
			We have a deal, right?

					WORF
			Do we?

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE 36A.

46   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(to Ezri)
			Tell him.

					INTENDANT (O.S.)
			Yes, my dear, why don't you tell
			him.

	All eyes turn to --

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  37.

47   ANGLE ON THE DOOR

	to see the Intendant being led into the room by a
	GUARD, who quickly EXITS.

					INTENDANT
			I knew you wouldn't disappoint
			me.

	And with that, the Intendant gives Ezri an
	appreciative kiss.

					ROM
			Uh-oh.

					QUARK
				(to the Regent)
			You're not going to give us the
			Nagus, are you?

	The Regent simply shakes his head.

					QUARK
				(to Ezri)
			You knew about this all along.

					EZRI
				(re: the Intendant)
			What can I say? I'm loyal to my
			friends.

					INTENDANT
				(to Quark)
			Isn't she the best?

	Garak is also surprised by this turn of events.

					GARAK
				(to Worf, re: the
				Intendant)
			I don't understand... you're
			letting her go?

					WORF
			She's earned it. Getting them to
			bring us the cloaking device was
			her idea.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  38.

47   CONTINUED:

					INTENDANT
				(to Worf, re: Garak)
			I think you've hurt his feelings.
			He's probably never had a good
			idea in his life.

					GARAK
			I'm having one now... and I don't
			think you'd find it very
			pleasant.

					WORF
			Enough.
				(to Garak, re: Quark
				and Rom)
			Get rid of these two.

					BRUNT
				(to the Regent)
			Is that really necessary? They
			may come in handy.

					GARAK
			If the Regent wants your opinion,
			he'll ask for it.

					WORF
				(to Garak)
			Don't kill them just yet...

					GARAK
			But your magnificence --

					WORF
			You heard me, lock them up.

	After a beat, Garak nods reluctantly, turns and
	shoves Quark and Rom toward the door.

					GARAK
			Let's go.

48   ANGLE ON QUARK AND ROM

	as they stop in front of Ezri and the Intendant.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT THREE  39.

48   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(to Ezri, dry)
			I hope you two are very happy
			together.

					INTENDANT
			We will be.

	And with a baleful of glare, Quark follows Rom out
	the door.

49   ANGLE ON EZRI

	watching them go. The Intendant, already having
	forgotten the Ferengis, turns her full attention on
	Ezri, offering her a dazzling smile.

					INTENDANT
			It's so good to see you.

	And off this moment, we:

								FADE OUT.

51   INT. KLINGON HOLDING CELL

	ON three unhappy Ferengi and a sympathetic
	Maihar'du.

					ROM
			Our Ezri would never betray us,
			which means --

					QUARK
				(cutting him off)
			Don't start with that again.

					ZEK
			You're not going to tell your
			mother about the Intendant and
			me, are you?

					ROM
			It would break her heart.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR   41.

51   CONTINUED:

					ZEK
			In a million pieces. She
			worships me, you know. And I
			worship her right back. Besides,
			this is all your fault. If it
			weren't for you, I never would've
			been able to get to this
			universe. Remember the last time
			you came home to visit your
			mother?

	Rom nods.

					ZEK
			Well, one night while you were
			sleeping, I got up to get a bite
			to eat. And there, on the
			kitchen table, was a Starfleet
			PADD.

					ROMM
			My engineering notebook?
				(realizing)
			With the schematics for the multi-
			dimensional transporter that
			Chief O'Brien gave me to study.
				(a beat)
			You stole it...

					ZEK
			I'm your Nagus, you have no
			secrets from me.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR   42.

51   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
			I still don't understand why
			you'd want to come here in the
			first place?

					ZEK
			Simple, really. I came to find
			new financial opportunities for
			the Ferengi people.

					ROM
			In the Alternate Universe?

					ZEK
			It seemed like a good idea at the
			time...

					QUARK
			If you say so.
				(a beat)
			Right now, it would be a good
			idea for us to find a way out of
			here...

	And off that --

52   INT. KLINGON FLAGSHIP - QUARTERS

	Brunt is talking to Ezri, seated on a bunk. There's
	a plate of uneaten food beside her.

					BRUNT
			I just don't feel right about
			this. Quark and Rom deserve
			better.

					EZRI
			Forget about them, okay?

					BRUNT
			That's just it -- I can't. I
			like them and so do you.

					EZRI
			Don't tell me who I like.

					BRUNT
			Talk to the Intendant -- she
			listens to you. Tell her the
			Ferengi kept their part of the
			bargain, we should do the same.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR   43.

52   CONTINUED: 

					INTENDANT (O.S.)
			What a novel idea...

	Brunt and Ezri look up to see the Intendant stepping
	into the room.

					INTENDANT
			I can't recall the last time
			I kept my word.

					BRUNT
				(refusing to be
				intimidated)
			Maybe now's a good time to start.

					EZRI
				(a warning)
			Forget it, Brunt.

					BRUNT
			No, not this time.

					INTENDANT
				(to Ezri, re: Rom)
			Let the man speak, my dear. He
			obviously feels very passionate
			about this... and you know how
			responsive I am to passion.

	The Intendant moves closer to Brunt until her body
	is literally flat against his.

					INTENDANT
			Go on.

					BRUNT
			What do we gain by their deaths?
			Nothing. On the other hand, if
			we let them live, they may come
			in handy.

					INTENDANT
			I never thought of that...

					BRUNT
			The Regent will give them to you.
			All you have to do is ask.

					INTENDANT
				(considering the idea)
			Maybe, but why waste a favor on
			those little trolls? I'm afraid
			I don't like your suggestion.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR   44.

52   CONTINUED:	(2)
					INTENDANT (Cont'd)
			And now that I think about it, I
			don't much care for you either

	Suddenly, Brunt grimaces with pain -- the Intendant
	has driven a knife into his stomach. Brunt
	collapses to the ground.

53   ON EZRI

	as she leaps to her feet --

					EZRI
			No!

54   WIDER

	as the Intendant grabs Ezri by the waist and pulls
	her to her.

					INTENDANT
			He was going to betray me. I
			could see it in his eyes.
				(looking hard into
				her eyes)
			You wouldn't do that, would you?
			Of course not.

	And with that, she smiles seductively and releases
	her.

					INTENDANT
			I've suffered so much
			disappointment in my life.
			Brunt, Sisko, Bareil... the list
			just goes on and on.
				(looking down at
				Brunt's body)
			Dispose of that, will you? It
			depresses me.

					EZRI
			It's your mess. You clean it up.

DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR     45  

54   CONTINUED:

	And with that, Ezri walks out. We hold on the
	Intendant watching her leave. She smiles and turns
	her attention to Brunt's dead body.

					INTENDANT
			She's not afraid of anything, is
			she? Not even me.
				(a beat)
			I find that very exciting. Don't
			you?

55   INT. KLINGON FLAGSHIP - BRIDGE

	Garak is supervising a pair of Klingons working on
	an open panel. Ezri stands nearby, watching them
	work. The Regent sits in the Captain's Chair as a
	HELMSMAN reacts to something off his console.

					HELMSMAN
			Regent, long-range sensors have
			detected an enemy ship.
				(a beat)
			It's the Defiant.

					WORF
			Excellent.
				(to Garak)
			It's time to test the cloaking
			device.

					GARAK
			I'm afraid it's not operational
			yet.

					WORF
				(anger flaring)
			And why is that?

					GARAK
			It's a very complicated piece of
			equipment.

					EZRI
			One of the Ferengi seemed to know
			how it worked.

					WORF
				(an order)
			Then why isn't he here?

	Ezri's halfway out the door already.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR   46.

	CLOSE ON Rom.

			Getting the cloaking device

	FORCEFIELD.

					EZRI
			Good.
				(to a Klingon guard)
			Lower the forcefield.

	But before the Klingon can obey the order --

					QUARK
			Hold on a second.
				(to Ezri)
			Why should we help the Regent --
			or you for that matter?

					EZRI
			I'm trying to save your lives.

					ZEK
			That's a very worthy goal.

					QUARK
			Since when do you care about what
			happens to us?

					EZRI
				(not about to answer that)
			All right, forget it.

	Ezri turns to leave --

					ROM
				(coming to a decision)
			I don't want to forget it.

	Ezri turns back.

					ROM
				(to Quark)
			I'm sorry, brother.

DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FOUR     47  

56   CONTINUED:

			Maybe you want to die in this

			don't.

					ZEK
			Neither do I.
				(to the Klingon)
			Lower the forcefield!

	Ezri nods to the Klingon, who lowers the field.

					QUARK
			I suppose we have nothing to
			lose...

	Quark, Zek and Maihar'du start to follow Rom out of
	the holding cell, but Ezri stops them, allowing only
	Rom to step out.

					EZRI
			Where do you think you're going?

					QUARK
				(indicating Rom)
			With him. He needs my help.

					EZRI
			You're a bartender, Quark. What
			are you going to do? Mix him a
			drink?

	The Klingon raises the forcefield, locking Quark,
	Zek and Maihar'du in the cell.

					ROM
			Don't worry, brother. I'm not
			thirsty.

					EZRI
				(to Quark)
			I don't expect you to believe

					QUARK
			You're right, I don't believe it.

	And off this moment...

57   INT. KLINGON FLAGSHIP - BRIDGE

	CLOSE ON Rom working the open panel on the Bridge,

57   CONTINUED: 

					ROM
			Isodine coupler...

	Garak hands him one of the tools. Rom looks at the
	tool he's been handed and waves it at Garak.

					ROM
			Does this look like an isodine
			coupler to you? I don't see how
			anything gets fixed around here.

	One of the Klingons hands him the coupler.

					GARAK
			I'd advise you to watch your tone
			of voice, Ferengi.

					ROM
			Or what? You won't let me
			install the cloaking device?

					GARAK
				(through clenched teeth)
			I'm sorry if I upset you. Now
			would you please get back to work.

					ROM
				(cheerful)
			Don't mind if I do.

	As Rom works, Garak watches him very closely, trying
	to understand what Rom's doing.

58   ANGLE ON THE REGENT

	sitting in the Captain's Chair, the Intendant by his
	side, speaking softly into his ear. We can't hear
	what she's saying, but the Regent breaks into a
	saucy smile.

					WORF
			Really?

					INTENDANT
			Absolutely.

					WORF
			I've never tried that before.

					WORF
			And what do you expect in return?

					INTENDANT
			Terok Nor, what else?

					WORF
			I plan to destroy that station.

					INTENDANT
			Plans can be changed.

			I'll consider it.

					INTENDANT
			What more can I ask?

			Uh, Mister Regent...

	Worf turns to see --

				(to Rom)
			Well done.

					INTENDANT
			You mean no one can see us? How
			deliciously deceitful.

					WORF
				(to Garak)
			Do you know how to operate the

					GARAK
			What I don't know, I'll learn.

					ROM
			It's pretty simple -- once you

				(to the Regent)
			Now what about my brother and the
			Nagus?

					WORF
				(to Garak)
			Do we have any further use for

					GARAK
			Not that I can think of.

					WORF
			Then get rid of them.

				(pleased)
			You mean we're going home?

					GARAK
			No, he means you're going to die.

			That settles it. I'm never

			Excuse me?

					QUARK

					GARAK
			Like what?

75   CONTINUED:

					INTENDANT
				(a realization)
			That Ferengi -- he caused this!

					HELMSMAN
				(working the console)
			I can't get anything back on-line.

	Worf GROWLS with anger.


   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE   57.

76   INT. KLINGON HOLDING CELL

	As Garak flings Zek, Maihar'du and Rom off of him,
	he pins Quark to the bulkhead, still holding the
	hypo.

					GARAK
			You taught me something about
			sabotage... now I'm going to
			teach you something about pain.

	As Garak inches the hypo at Quark's neck, the
	Ferengi begins to SCREAM with fear.

77   CLOSER ON THE HYPO

	as it moves inexorably towards Quark. Suddenly, a
	woman's hand comes into frame, twists Garak's hand,
	and plunges the hypo into Garak's neck.

78   ON GARAK

	as his eyes widen.

					GARAK
			Ow.

	Garak turns to see his assailant, Ezri. Behind her,
	the Klingon guard lies dead on the ground.

					GARAK
				(through clenched
				teeth)
			That hurts...

	And with that, Garak's knees buckle, and he
	collapses.

79   ANGLE ON QUARK

	as he catches his breath.

					QUARK
			How much is this going to cost
			us?

					EZRI
			I'm not doing this for money.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE  57A.

79   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			Then why?

					EZRI
			You want to get out of here or
			not?

					ZEK
			Of course we do.

					EZRI
				(to Quark)
			Then stop asking questions and
			let's go.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE   58.

79   CONTINUED:	(2)

	And with that, Ezri leads the Ferengis and Maihar'du
	out the door.

79A  OMITTED

79B  INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	as Bashir stares at one of the consoles, surprised
	by what he sees.

					BASHIR
			They're not coming after us...

					SMILEY
			Why not?

					BASHIR
			They can't. Their power grid is
			off-line...

					SMILEY
				(to Bashir)
			Then what do you say we give the
			Regent a proper greeting?

					BASHIR
				(good idea; to helm)
			Reverse course.

80   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	To see the Defiant swoop in and begin firing at the
	Klingon flagship.

81   INT. KLINGON FLAGSHIP - BRIDGE

	ROCKED by a series of phaser blasts. The Regent has
	to struggle to keep from being tossed from his seat.

					WORF
			We must raise shields.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE  58A.

81   CONTINUED: 

					HELMSMAN
			We can't.

	Another violent SHAKE.

					INTENDANT
			I don't know how much more of
			this the hull can withstand.

	Yet another HIT.

					HELMSMAN
				(off his console)
			Captain Smiley would like a word
			with you...

	Worf GROWLS again, wishing there was something else
	he could do. After a beat, he nods.

82   ANGLE ON THE VIEWSCREEN

	as the triumphant faces of Smiley and Bashir appear.

					SMILEY
			That's a very nice ship you have
			there, Regent. I'd hate to see
			it destroyed.

					BASHIR
			But of course, if you insist...

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE   59.

83   ON THE REGENT

					WORF
			What are your terms?

					SMILEY
			A simple unconditional surrender
			should do the trick.

					INTENDANT
				(to the Regent)
			I'm afraid you've run out of
			options.

					WORF
				(this costs him)
			The victory is yours.

	Smiley and Bashir can't help but relish the moment.

					SMILEY
			Prepare to be boarded.

84   ANGLE ON WORF

	as the viewscreen goes dead. The Regent stands up,
	rips his chair out of the floor and lifts it up over
	his head. Then with an ear-splitting Klingon YELL,
	he tosses it away.

85   INT. KLINGON FLAGSHIP - CORRIDOR

	Ezri, Quark, Rom, Zek and Maihar'du make their way
	through the hallway, only to come upon the
	Intendant, coming the other way. The Intendant and
	Ezri instinctively draw phasers on one another.

					INTENDANT
				(to Ezri)
			What a surprise. I've been
			looking all over for you.

					EZRI
			Here I am.

					INTENDANT
				(re: the phaser)
			Is that really necessary?

					EZRI
			I was about to ask you the same
			question.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE  59A.

85   CONTINUED:

	The Intendant smiles and lowers her phaser. Ezri
	does the same.

					INTENDANT
			There, that's better. You and I
			have to get to one of the escape
			shuttles.

					EZRI
			You go. I'm staying here.

					INTENDANT
			You're not serious, are you?

					EZRI
			You shouldn't have killed Brunt.

					INTENDANT
			Isn't it a little late to develop
			a conscience?

					EZRI
			I hope not.

	And with that, the Intendant rushes off.

DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE     60  

85   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ZEK
				(good news)
			Brunt's dead?

					ROM
				(patting him on the
				back)
			Sorry, wrong Brunt.

					QUARK
			We're not going to let her get
			away, are we?

					EZRI
				(nodding)
			I owe her that much.

					ZEK
			Oh, let her go.
				(rubbing his ear
				absentmindedly)
			I can't quite put my finger on
			it, but there's something about
			that woman I find...
			intoxicating.

	Quark, Rom and Maihar'du look at the Nagus as if
	he's stark, raving mad. And off that image...

86   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing Terok Nor.

87   INT. TEROK NOR - CARGO BAY

	as Smiley and Bashir step out an airlock, a manacled
	Regent between them. They are met by a CHEERING
	CROWD of rebels.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE   61.

88   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Quark, Ezri, Rom, Zek and Maihar'du come out the
	airlock and make their way through the crowd.

					ROM
				(to the Nagus)
			Glad to be going home?

					ZEK
			You bet I am. But that doesn't
			mean I won't be coming back.

					ROM
				(surprised)
			Here? What for?

					ZEK
			There's a fortune to be made in
			the Alternate Universe. I can
			feel it in my lobes.

					QUARK
			Well don't expect us to come
			chasing after you again.

					ZEK
			Don't worry, I won't. Next time,
			I'm bringing you along with me.

	Quark isn't thrilled by the prospect.

					EZRI
			In that case, I won't bother
			saying good-bye.

	Looking at Ezri, the notion of coming back doesn't
	seem so unappealing to Quark.

					QUARK
			You know, coming back isn't such
			a bad idea... if I knew I was
			going to see you again.

					EZRI
			I'm not going anywhere.

					QUARK
				(emboldened)
			In that case... maybe I should
			stick around a couple of days.
			You could show me the station...

					EZRI
			I don't think that's such a good
			idea...

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE  61A.

88   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			I could help you work on that
			conscience of yours.

					EZRI
			I think I can take it from here.

	Just then, from off screen, a female voice cries out:

					LEETA (O.S.)
			Excuse me.

	They all turn to see --

89   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as LEETA approaches. This Leeta is dressed in rebel
	clothes, but she still manages to look very
	enticing.

					ROM
			Leeta?

					LEETA
			Do I know you?

					ROM
			We're married.

					LEETA
				(you must be joking)
			I don't think so.

	Leeta turns to Ezri.

					LEETA
			You're Ezri, right?
				(off her nod)
			Captain Smiley wants me to
			debrief you.

					EZRI
			Must be my lucky day.

	And with that Ezri and Leeta walk off together.

   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Emperor's... " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE   62.

90   ANGLE ON THE FERENGIS

	watching them leave.

					ZEK
			Quite a fascinating place, don't
			you agree?

					ROM
				(sullen)
			I want to go home.

					QUARK
			Me, too.

	And off this moment, we:

								FADE TO BLACK.

                        END OF ACT FIVE                         
                            THE END
