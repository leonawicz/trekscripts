	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Runabout Mekong moving through space.

					KIRA (V.O.)
			First Officer's Log, Stardate 48521.5.  
			Odo and I are returning to Deep Space 
			Nine after reviewing security 
			procedures at Prophet's Landing, the 
			Bajoran Colony closest to the 
			Cardassian Border.

2    INT. MEKONG

	KIRA and ODO are at the controls of the Mekong.

					KIRA
			Those orbital sensor platforms should 
			give the colonists plenty of advanced 
			warning in case the Cardassians ever 
			decide to violate the new treaty.

					ODO
				(distracted)
			Hopefully.

					KIRA
			How did your meeting with Security 
			Chief Bemar go?

					ODO
			Fine.

	Odo seems preoccupied and maybe a little grumpy.

					KIRA
				(joking)
			I assume he was properly impressed 
			by the depth of your expertise.

	Odo just harumphs.  Kira studies Odo for a beat, wondering 
	why he's not making any effort to keep up his end of the 
	conversation.

           STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - TEASER           2.

2    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Odo, is something bothering you?

					ODO
			What makes you say that?

					KIRA
			For one thing, you haven't said more 
			than five words to me since we left 
			Prophet's Landing.

	Odo harumphs again.

					KIRA
			Look, if I've done something to offend 
			you I wish you'd tell me what it is.

	Odo looks at her for a beat.  For a second it seems like 
	he's going to open up, but then he thinks better of it.

					ODO
			It's nothing.

					KIRA
			No.  It's something.  So you might 
			as well talk about it.  It might 
			make you feel better.

	Odo harumphs again.

					KIRA
			Nevermind.  Forget I asked.

	There's an awkward silence, then...

					ODO
			It's not important.

					KIRA
			Whatever you say.

					ODO
			It's certainly not worth making an 
			issue about.

					KIRA
			I'm glad to hear it.

					ODO
			It's just... when Governor Avesta 
			invited us to dinner at his house...

 STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - TEASER           3.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA
			Go on.

					ODO
			You said no.

					KIRA
				(still not getting it)
			And?

					ODO
				(uncomfortable)
			You never bothered to ask me if I 
			wanted to go.

	Kira looks at Odo.  She can't believe that that's what's 
	troubling him.

					KIRA
			You wanted to go to dinner at the 
			governor's house?

					ODO
			Not particularly.

					KIRA
			Then what's the problem?

					ODO
			The problem is... you never asked 
			what I wanted.

					KIRA
			I'm sorry... I just thought that you 
			wouldn't want to go.

					ODO
			How could you know for certain if 
			you never asked?

					KIRA
			Odo... you don't eat!
				(beat)
			Besides, you hate socializing with 
			people you don't know.

					ODO
			That's beside the point.  I would've 
			liked to have been consulted, that's 
			all.

					KIRA
			You're right.
				(joking)
			Next time we're invited to dinner, 
			I'll let you be the one to say no.

           STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - TEASER           4.

2    CONTINUED:	(3)

					ODO
			I'd appreciate that.

	Kira can't help but smile.  Suddenly, the moment is broken 
	by a signal from the control panel.

					KIRA
				(off readouts)
			Hold on, I'm picking up a wide band 
			subspace transmission from a Lissepian 
			supply ship.  They were just attacked 
			by a Maquis interceptor.

	Odo quickly consults the runabout controls.

					ODO
			Long range sensors are detecting a 
			modified Peregrine Class courier 
			ship, lightly armed, one man crew, 
			bearing two-six-eight mark three-oh-
			one.

					KIRA
			The Maquis use Peregrine Class courier 
			ships.
				(off Odo's nod)
			The Lissepians didn't sustain any 
			serious damage.  I'm going after 
			him.

					ODO
			Right.

	And as Kira works the controls...

3    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Mekong goes to warp.

									FADE OUT.

4    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	SISKO is working at his desk, retrieving information from a 
	PADD.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			O'Brien to Sisko.

					SISKO
			Go ahead.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			Commander, there's... someone here 
			to see you.

					SISKO
			Who is it?

5    INT. OPS

	Intercut as necessary.  O'BRIEN'S at his station.  He looks 
	down at Sisko's visitor.

					O'BRIEN
				(can't believe it 
				himself)
			It's... Nog, sir.

	NOG looks up at O'Brien and smiles nervously.  He's carrying 
	a small bundle wrapped in a bar rag.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE
				(surprised)
			Nog.

					NOG
			Tell him it's urgent.

					O'BRIEN
				(dubious)
			He says it's urgent.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE
				(resigned)
			Send him in.

					NOG
				(self satisfied)
			I told you he'd see me.

	Nog marches into...

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT ONE           6.

6    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	Where he finds Sisko at his desk.

					NOG
			Commander, first let me express my 
			most sincere thanks for allowing me 
			to speak with you.

	He sticks out his hand for Sisko to shake.  After a beat, 
	Sisko takes it and shakes it.

					SISKO
			You're welcome.  Now what's this all 
			about?

					NOG
			I wanted to give you... this.

	Nog places the bundle on Sisko's desk.  Sisko looks at the 
	bundle, and then looks at Nog.

					NOG
			Open it.

	Sisko looks at Nog for a beat, then cautiously unwraps the 
	bundle.  It's a large stack of latinum.

					SISKO
			What's this?

					NOG
			It's latinum.

					SISKO
			I know it's latinum.  Why are you 
			giving it to me?

					NOG
			Yesterday I completed the Ferengi 
			Attainment Ceremony.
				(with pride)
			I'm an adult.

					SISKO
			Congratulations.

					NOG
			Thank you.

					SISKO
				(re: the latinum)
			But that still doesn't explain this.

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT ONE           7.


6    CONTINUED:

					NOG
			It's my life's savings.  According 
			to Ferengi Bylaws, section one-oh-
			five, subparagraph ten, upon reaching 
			adulthood, Ferengi males must purchase 
			an apprenticeship from a suitable 
			role model.
				(a beat)
			I choose you.

					SISKO
			You want to be my apprentice?

					NOG
			That's right.  I want to be the first 
			Ferengi in Starfleet.  Now who do I 
			see about getting a uniform?

					SISKO
			Nog, I'm afraid it doesn't work that 
			way.  We don't just give Starfleet 
			uniforms to anyone.

	Nog was half expecting this.

					NOG
			I understand.

	He reaches into his coat and pulls out two more handfuls of 
	latinum and plops them on the desk.

					NOG
			But a man of your stature could 
			undoubtedly arrange something.  One 
			day, I plan on being a commander 
			just like you.

					SISKO
			Nog, if you want to be a Starfleet 
			Officer, you have to attend the 
			Academy.

					NOG
				(thinks about it for 
				a beat)
			All right.  Where do I sign up?

					SISKO
			It's not that simple.  As a non-
			Federation citizen, you need a letter 
			of reference from a command level 
			officer before you can even take the 
			entrance exam.

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT ONE           8.

6    CONTINUED:	(2)

					NOG
			A command level officer?  You mean, 
			like you?

					SISKO
			Yes.  Like me.

					NOG
			Perfect.  Is it a form letter or 
			would you like me to help you write 
			it?

					SISKO
			Tell me Nog... why do you want to 
			join Starfleet?  Why not serve aboard 
			a Ferengi ship?

					NOG
			Are you saying that, as a Ferengi, 
			I'm not good enough to join Starfleet?

					SISKO
			Not at all.

					NOG
			Then you'll write the letter.

					SISKO
			I'll think about it.

					NOG
			Thank you, Commander.  I know you'll 
			make the right decision.

	He sticks out his hand for Sisko to shake again, and Sisko 
	shakes it.  Nog turns to leave.

					SISKO
			Hold on.

	Nog stops and turns back.

					SISKO
				(re: the latinum)
			Aren't you forgetting something?

					NOG
			Keep it.  Consider it a token of my 
			appreciation.

	And Nog EXITS, leaving a puzzled and slightly suspicious 
	Sisko behind.

        STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - REV. 11/28/94 - ACT ONE        9.

7    EXT. SPACE - THE MEKONG (OPTICAL)

	at warp.

8    INT. MEKONG (VPB)

	Kira and Odo continue their pursuit of the Maquis interceptor.  
	There's a graphic representing the fleeing ship on one of 
	the monitors.

					KIRA
			I don't know what the Maquis have 
			done to that ship's engines, but 
			it's fast.

					ODO
			Not fast enough.  We're closing on 
			him.

					KIRA
			We'd better catch him soon.  We're 
			entering the Badlands.

					ODO
			Clever.  He probably knows this 
			territory a lot better than we do.

					KIRA
			Now aren't you glad I didn't accept 
			that dinner invitation.  If I had, 
			we would've missed all this 
			excitement.

					ODO
			That would've been a pity.
				(a beat, off monitors)
			Wait a minute... I've lost him.  The 
			Badlands' plasma fields are disrupting 
			our sensors.

					KIRA
			Increase the sensor bandwidth.  That 
			should compensate for the 
			interference.

	Odo follows her instructions.

					ODO
			I hope you're right.

					KIRA
			He couldn't have gotten far. He's 
			probably somewhere in this solar 
			system.

        STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - REV. 11/28/94 - ACT ONE       9A.

8    CONTINUED:

					ODO
				(as he works)
			There he is.  It looks like he's 
			headed for one of the moons orbiting 
			that gas giant.

					KIRA
			I'm following him in.

        STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - REV. 11/28/94 - ACT ONE       10.

8    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			Something's wrong with his ship.  It 
			looks like his attitude stabilizers 
			have failed.

					KIRA
				(urgent)
			Can we get a transporter lock on 
			him?

					ODO
				(off monitors)
			There's too much interference.

	On the monitor, the graphics show the Maquis ship moving 
	toward a planetary surface.

					ODO
			He's trying to land on that moon.

	The symbol representing the Maquis ship disappears.

					ODO
			We've lost him.

					KIRA
			Did he make it?

					ODO
			I don't know.  Something in the moon's 
			atmosphere is jamming our sensors.

					KIRA
			Then I guess we'll have to land and 
			see for ourselves.

	Kira begins piloting the runabout in for a landing.

9    EXT. SPACE - THE MEKONG (OPTICAL)

	alters course at impulse speed.

	TIME CUT:

10   INT. LUNAR CAVERNS

	Odo and Kira round a bend in the cavern.  Kira is armed with 
	a Bajoran phaser and both she and Odo carry tricorders and 
	palm beacons.  (The beacons are the only source of light).

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT ONE          11.

10   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			The tricorders are useless.  The 
			atmospheric ionization is jamming 
			their transponders.

					KIRA
			You're sure he's in these caverns?

					ODO
			He wasn't in the wreckage of his 
			ship.  And given the weather 
			conditions on the surface, there's 
			no way anyone could survive out there 
			very long.  So that leaves...

	Suddenly, a violent tremor shakes the caverns.

					KIRA
			That's the third quake since we 
			landed.  This moon must be seismically 
			unstable.

					ODO
			The sooner we find our fugitive, the 
			better off we'll be.

	They come to a split in the cave.  Two likely looking 
	corridors branch off into the darkness.

					KIRA
			Finding him isn't going to be easy.  
			These caverns could go on forever.  
			And given all this seismic activity, 
			I don't want to stay here any longer 
			than we have to.
				(a beat)
			I say we split up.  We can meet back 
			here in twenty minutes.  If we haven't 
			found him by then, we may have to 
			leave without him.

					ODO
			If he's smart, he'll let us find 
			him.  A Federation prison would be 
			paradise compared to this place.

					KIRA
			Let's hope he's smart.

					ODO
			I'll see you in twenty minutes.

	Kira nods and she and Odo separate.

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT ONE          12.

11   INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAVERN

	Time cut.  Odo is searching his corridor.  Suddenly his 
	combadge chirps.  The signal is full of static.  Only 
	underlined words can be heard clearly.

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Kira to Odo.  Odo, do you hear me?

					ODO
				(to com)
			This is Odo.  I can barely hear you.

					KIRA
			Odo, I'm trapped and I need your 
			help.  Come quickly.  Odo, do you 
			read me?  This is Kira...

					ODO
			Stay where you are, Major.  I'll be 
			right there.

	Odo immediately heads back up the corridor in the direction 
	he came.

12   INT. LUNAR CAVERN

	Odo reaches the branch in the cave.  He goes down the branch 
	that Kira took.

13   INT. CAVERN CORRIDOR

	Odo moves down the corridor.  Kira's voice can be heard in 
	the distance.

					KIRA'S VOICE
			Odo... Odo is that you?

	Odo hurries and emerges into...

14   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER

	Odo ENTERS a large more open chamber in the cavern.  Multiple 
	corridors lead away from the chamber deeper into the system 
	of caves.  There's also a large amount of rubble in the cave, 
	the result of the high level of seismic activity.

					ODO
			I'm right here, Major.

        STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - REV. 11/18/94 - ACT ONE       13.

15   NEW ANGLE


	Kira is leaning against an outcropping of wall.  Her beacon 
	is in the middle of the room as if she'd dropped it and it'd 
	rolled away.

					KIRA
			Odo, am I glad to see you.

					ODO
			What's wrong?

					KIRA
				(embarrassed)
			You're not going to believe this... 
			my foot is stuck.

					ODO
			Stuck?
				(makes his way over 
				to her)
			How?

					KIRA
			I don't know.  I must've stepped 
			into a fissure or something.  I can't 
			get it loose.

					ODO
			Let me take a look.

	Odo kneels down and shines his beacon on Kira's foot.

16   CLOSE ON KIRA'S FOOT (OPTICAL)

	In the beacon light, we can see that Kira's foot has been 
	encased in some kind of crystalline formation.  The crystals 
	sparkle in the beacon light.  As Odo watches, the crystal 
	spreads, almost imperceptibly, up to Kira's ankle.

17   CLOSE ON ODO

	As he reacts to this strange sight.

					ODO
			It's not a fissure.

					KIRA
			Then what is it?

					ODO
			Your foot's been encased in some 
			kind of crystal.  And from the look 
			of things...

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT ONE          14.

17   CONTINUED:

					ODO
				(he looks up at Kira)
			The crystal's spreading.

18   CLOSE ON KIRA

	As she reacts to her bizarre situation.  Hold on her 
	expression for a beat, then...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

19   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

	As before.  Kira is still trapped and the crystal formation 
	has encased her foot.  There's another minor tremor.

					ODO
			You're sure you can't pull it loose?

					KIRA
				(still tugging at it)
			Believe me, I've tried.

					ODO
			Maybe if you slipped your foot out 
			of your boot.

					KIRA
			I can barely feel my foot, the crystal 
			is pressing against it so hard.  
			There's no way I can get my boot 
			off.

	Odo considers the situation for a beat, then...

					ODO
			Hold on.

	Odo goes and picks up a large chunk of rock that's been shaken 
	loose by one of the tremors.

					ODO
			This might hurt a little.

					KIRA
			Go ahead.

	Odo uses the rock to hammer on the crystal formation.  After 
	a couple of medium hard blows, which have no effect, Odo 
	hauls off and really smashes the crystal.

	The rock he's using as a bludgeon cracks and shatters in his 
	hand.  Kira can't help herself; she shakes her head and 
	chuckles.

					ODO
			I fail to see the humor in this 
			situation.

					KIRA
			Oh come on, Odo.  You have to admit, 
			it's pretty ridiculous.
				(joking)
			The two of us outsmarted by a chunk 
			of crystal.

	Odo is not nearly as amused by the situation as Kira.

					ODO
			I'm not giving up just yet.

	Kira thinks about it for a beat, then...

					KIRA
			Neither am I.  Hand me my phaser.

	Odo looks around.

					KIRA
			It's over there.  By the palm beacon.

	Odo dutifully retrieves the phaser, but he's not enthusiastic 
	about Kira's solution.

					ODO
			You're sure this is a good idea?  If 
			you're not careful...

					KIRA
			I'll blow my foot off and Julian 
			will have a chance to prove what a 
			wonderful doctor he is.
				(smiles)
			Don't worry, I have no intention of 
			giving him the opportunity.  Now 
			stand back.

	Kira adjusts the setting on her Bajoran phaser.

20   CLOSE ON KIRA'S LEG (OPTICAL)

	As Kira fires the phaser at the crystal formation.  The 
	crystal is bathed in energy from the phaser, but instead of 
	shattering, it grows, rapidly spreading until it reaches a 
	point just above Kira's knee.

					KIRA
			I guess that wasn't a very good idea 
			after all.

					ODO
				(examining the crystal)
			The crystal formation seems to have 
			somehow fed off the energy from the 
			phaser.

	Suddenly, the cavern is rocked by another tremor, this one 
	severe.  After the tremor subsides, Odo looks around at the 
	cavern with concern.  Odo hits his combadge.

					ODO
				(to com)
			Odo to Mekong.  Two to beam out.  
			Energize.

	There's a long pause with no answer.

					ODO
				(to com)
			Odo to Mekong.
				(gives up, to Kira)
			I can't contact the runabout.  There's 
			too much interference.  I'll have to 
			walk back to the landing site and 
			try to transport you from there.

	But Odo hesitates.

					KIRA
			You're worried about leaving me here?

					ODO
			Now that you mention it, yes.

					KIRA
			I'll be fine, Odo.
				(smiles)
			I promise not to go anywhere.

					ODO
			What about our Maquis fugitive?

	Kira holds up her phaser.

					KIRA
			If he shows up, I'll make sure he 
			waits here until you get back.

	Odo nods and leaves.

			Yeah, kind of.

			I'm saying it now.

					JAKE
			So what brought this on?

					NOG
			I have my reasons.

					JAKE
			Okay.  Name one.

					NOG
			Why should I?

					JAKE
			Cause I'm your friend.  And friends

			I see you've put in a request to

			I thought it'd be for the best.  
			Given his condition, I don't want

					SISKO
			His condition?

					SISKO
			You mean... he's pregnant?

					BASHIR
			Twins.

			Not exactly.

					NOG
			What does that mean, "not exactly?"

					SISKO
			Look, Nog, I have to be honest with 
			you, when I think of candidates for 
			Starfleet Academy, yours is not the

					NOG
			Why not?  Because I'm a Ferengi?

			My reaction exactly.

					DAX
			I've always thought it would be 
			interesting to have a Ferengi in

					SISKO
			I know it seems unlikely, but before 
			I make up my mind, I want to give

					DAX
			Commander, there's a lot of valuable 
			equipment in Cargo Bay Twelve.

					SISKO
			I know.

					DAX
			Maybe I'd better assign a couple of 
			crewmembers to... assist him.

	Meaning she doesn't trust Nog for a second.

					SISKO
			No.  I want him to do it alone.  No

			crystalline webbing that they use to 
			construct their buildings.  A band 
			of Nausicaan raiders broke into their 
			central museum by using a high 
			frequency ultrasonic generator to 
			create a sympathetic vibration in 
			the webbing and shatter it.

					KIRA
				(joking)
			So all we have to do is find some 
			Nausicaan raiders and ask them to 
			give us a hand.

					ODO
			I might be able to put together a 
			makeshift generator using the 
			covariant oscillator from the 
			runabout.  The trick will be finding 
			the right frequency to create a 
			sympathetic vibration inside this 
			crystal.
				(a beat)
			I'll have to go back to the runabout

					ODO
			Next to his work and his family, 
			"shooting the rapids" is his favorite 
			activity.  He's had the holo-program 
			since he was on the Enterprise.

					KIRA
			So how long do these boat trips 
			usually take?

					ODO
			That depends.

					KIRA
			On what?

					ODO
			On how many times we capsize.
				(a beat)
			The truth is, Major, Chief O'Brien's 
			never completed the entire program.

					KIRA
			Not once?

					ODO
			Not in seven years of trying.

					KIRA
			It must be a very difficult program.

			half dozen times trying to make it 
			down those rapids.

					KIRA
			Then why does he keep doing it?

					ODO
			Because he loves it.  And it's been 
			my observation that you humanoids 
			have a hard time giving up the things 
			you love... no matter how much they 
			might hurt you.

			I never read any of those books.

			There must be some humanoid platitude

			I'm afraid I don't have much use for

			I feel the same way.

			You're sure he didn't have any help?

					DAX
			According to the internal sensors,

			I guess he learned a few things

			I assume all our equipment is still... 
			where it's supposed to be?

					DAX
			If you're asking if he stole anything, 
			the answer is no.  He even found 
			some items we missed during our last

					SISKO
			Okay, so we know he's a hard worker, 
			but the question remains: Why does

					DAX
			I have no idea.

				(to Rom)
			Isn't that right?

					ROM
			Well, I...

					QUARK
				(interrupting)
			You see.  He can barely speak he's

			Lieutenant, please, this is between

					SISKO
			Actually, that's not true.  Your...

			You see, brother, I told you.

				(to Quark)
			And as for the latinum, must I remind

46   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER

	The crystal formation has reached the middle of Kira's chest.  
	Her breathing is noticeably strained and shallow.  Odo is 
	working on the ultrasonic generator.  He looks grim.

					ODO
			I don't understand it.  I've run 
			through the entire harmonic spectrum 
			and none of the frequencies have had 
			an effect on the crystal.  It's almost 
			as if the structure of the crystal 
			is mutating to keep us from finding 
			the right frequency.

					KIRA
			Odo.

	Odo turns to see Kira grimacing in pain.

					ODO
			Yes, Major.

	He hurries over to her.  She grabs hold of his hand as if to 
	fight down the pain.

					ODO
			I wish there was something else I 
			could do...

					KIRA
			Just keep talking to me.

	There's a slight tremor, but it has no effect on the cave.  
	Both Odo and Kira try to ignore it.

					ODO
			What do you want me to say?

					KIRA
			Anything.  Tell me a story.

	You can almost see the wheels turning in Odo's mind as he 
	tries to come up with something to talk about.

					ODO
			A story?

46   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			I know.  Tell me how you got your 
			name.

					ODO
			My name?  Come to think of it, that 
			is an amusing story.

					KIRA
			Tell it to me.

					ODO
			Well, as you know, when Doctor Mora 
			first brought me to his laboratory, 
			it was under Cardassian supervision.  
			All specimens had to be clearly 
			labeled in Cardassian, so that the 
			overseers would always know what the 
			scientists were working on.  Since 
			no one could decide exactly what I 
			was, Mora labelled me "Unknown 
			Sample," which the overseer translated 
			into Cardassian as "Odo'ital."

					KIRA
			So your name is "Unknown Sample?"

					ODO
			No.  "Odo'ital" literally means 
			"Nothing."  Even after it became 
			clear that I was sentient, the Bajoran 
			scientists kept calling me that.  As 
			a joke, they split it into two words, 
			like a Bajoran name: "Odo Ital."  
			Which eventually got shortened...

					KIRA
			To Odo.

	There's yet another tremor, this one strong enough to knock 
	some dirt from the ceiling.

					ODO
				(nods)
			But the thing is, for the longest 
			time, when anyone spoke my name, the 
			first thing I'd think of was what it 
			meant: "Nothing."  What better way 
			to describe me?  I had no family, no 
			friends, no place where I belonged.

				(covering)
			And the others.  Sisko, Dax, even

			myself as... me.

	There's a pause as Kira and Odo both ponder the meaning of 
	Odo's story.

					ODO
				(with a wry smile)
			I'm sorry, Major.  I guess that story 
			wasn't as amusing as I'd hoped it 
			would be.

					KIRA
			No.  I liked it very much.

	There's another awkward silence, then...

					KIRA
				(softly)
			The ultrasonic generator isn't going 
			to work, is it?

					ODO
			No, I'm afraid it's not.

					KIRA
			I don't suppose you have any other 
			ideas.

					ODO
			I wish I had.

					KIRA
			If it makes you feel better, I don't 
			have any either.

					ODO
			It just doesn't make sense.  The

			Odo, you've done your best.  Now I

				(continues)
			There's no way someone standing here 
			could've hit those rocks without 
			hitting you first.

					KIRA
			Maybe he was standing somewhere else.

					ODO
			Maybe.  Or maybe you were lying to 
			me.  Which makes two times you've 
			lied to me today.

					KIRA
			What are you talking about?

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE         53.

53   CONTINUED:	(3)

					ODO
			You lied when you said you were shot 
			at by the Maquis.  And you lied when 
			you said you loved me.

					KIRA

			But I do love you.

					ODO
			I wish you did.  But you don't.
				(a beat)
			Remember Major, I pride myself on my 
			ability to observe human nature.  
			And I've watched you for the past 
			three years.  In all that time, I 
			never saw the slightest indication 
			that you had those kinds of feelings 
			for me.  You like me.  You think of 
			me as a close friend... but love?  
			I'm afraid not.

	There's a long beat as Kira wrestles with how to reply.

					KIRA
			Maybe I said I loved you because I 
			thought it'd make you feel better.  
			Because I thought it was what you 
			wanted to hear.

					ODO
			You're lying again.  The Kira I know 
			values our friendship far too much 
			to lie to me, even for the best of 
			reasons.

					KIRA
			Odo... I can explain...

	The cavern is hit by another tremor.  Odo picks up Kira's 
	Bajoran phaser and aims it at her.

					ODO
			Good.  You can start by telling me 
			who you are and what you've done 
			with Kira.

	There's a long beat, and then Kira smiles.

54   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	As Kira and her crystalline prison both MORPH into the FEMALE 
	CHANGELING we met in "THE SEARCH."

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE         54.

54   CONTINUED:

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			Well done, Odo.  You really are quite 
			a skillful investigator.

					ODO
			And you're quite a skillful 
			changeling.

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			You still have much to learn.

					ODO
			If you want to share your wisdom 
			with me, you can start by telling me 
			where Major Kira is.

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			Close by.

					ODO
			You were the fugitive we were chasing, 
			weren't you?

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			That's correct.

					ODO
			How'd you get your hands on a Maquis 
			ship?

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			Now, Odo, you can't expect me to 
			give you all the answers.

					ODO
			But why did you lead us here?  And 
			why replace Kira?

	The ground shakes again.

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			I needed to understand why you chose 
			to live with the Solids rather than 
			your own people.  I suspected it had 
			something to do with Major Kira.
				(a beat)
			And now I'm certain of it.

					ODO
			So your plan was to let me think she 
			died.  You thought that would take 
			away my link to the Solids.

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE         55.

54   CONTINUED:	(2)

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			And then you would return to us.

					ODO
			I assure you, nothing will ever make 
			me do that.

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			I wouldn't be so sure.

					ODO
				(still aiming the 
				phaser)
			Tell me where she is.

					FEMALE CHANGELING
			And if I don't, then what?  You'll 
			shoot me?
				(smiles)
			No changeling has ever harmed another.

					ODO
			There's a first time for everything.

	The Female Changeling studies Odo for a beat, then comes to 
	a decision.

					FEMALE CHANGELING
				(points)
			Major Kira is down that tunnel, two 
			hundred meters south of here.  Save 
			her if it suits you.
				(pointedly)
			But it won't make any difference.  
			She's never going to love you.  How 
			could she?  You're a changeling.

	And with that...

55   ANGLE ON THE FEMALE CHANGELING (OPTICAL)

	The Female Changeling disappears in a Dominion Transporter 
	beam.

56   CLOSE ON ODO

	As he reacts to her beam out.

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE        55A.

57   INT. SIDE CORRIDOR

	A tremor shakes the caverns.  It's one of the most violent 
	ones yet.  Odo bends down into frame and pulls the cover off 
	a coffin-like containment chamber.

	Kira is inside.

					ODO
				(urgent)
			Major.  Wake up.

					KIRA
				(groggy)
			Odo, what happened?  How did I get 
			here...

	The tremor continues.

					ODO
			It's a long story.  Right now we 
			have to get you to the Mekong.

	And as Odo helps Kira up and the two of them retreat down 
	the quaking corridor...

									CUT TO:

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE         56.

58   EXT. DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

59   INT. PROMENADE

	As Odo and Kira step out of the airlock.

					KIRA
			There's one thing I still don't 
			understand.  If that Founder wanted 
			to test your allegiance to the Solids, 
			why did she impersonate me?

	There's a long beat as Odo searches for an answer.

					ODO
			I suppose it's because you happened 
			to be with me in the runabout.  It 
			could just as easily have been 
			Commander Sisko... or Doctor Bashir.

					KIRA
			So what finally made you realize the 
			truth?

					ODO
			Eventually she made a mistake.  She 
			said something I know you would never 
			say.

					KIRA
			And what was that?

					ODO
			Just a slip of the tongue.  Nothing 
			important.

	And as they pass out of frame, the camera moves into...

60   INT. QUARK'S

	Where Quark is railing against the injustice of Sisko's 
	decision while Rom and Nog continue work at the bar.

					QUARK
			I tell you, I won't stand for it.  
			No nephew of mine is going to disgrace 
			our family name by joining Starfleet.

					NOG
			But Uncle Quark...

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE        56A.

60   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			My mind is made up.  I forbid it.

	Suddenly Rom decides he's had enough of this.

					ROM
			No you don't.

          STAR TREK: "Heart of Stone" - 11/17/94 - ACT FIVE         57.

60   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
			Rom, stay out of this.

					ROM
			I will not.  When it comes to the 
			bar, you may be in charge, but when 
			it comes to my son, I make the 
			decisions.

					QUARK
			Then you tell him he can't go.

					ROM
			I'll do no such thing.

					QUARK
			What?

					ROM
				(to Nog)
			Nog.  Good luck.  I would be proud 
			to have a son in Starfleet.

					QUARK
			You're both insane.

	Nog and Rom smile at each other.

					NOG
			Like father, like son.

	And the two of them walk away, leaving Quark alone at the 
	bar.  Hold on his exasperated face for a beat, then...

									FADE OUT.
