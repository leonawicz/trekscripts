	FADE IN:

1    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	Close on an alien woman in casual clothes... she has a 
	terrific body... but is intelligent, not a ditz, though a 
	little nervous here... she's holding a small PADD...

					MISS SARDA
			I'm not what a lot of people think...

	Moving to reveal Sisko... uncomfortable at being put in this 
	situation...

					MISS SARDA
				(continuing)
			I mean if you're a dabo girl, you 
			know, you get a reputation...

					SISKO
			Miss Sarda, why don't tell me exactly 
			what happened?  When did you start 
			having trouble with Quark...

					MISS SARDA
			About five minutes after I got off 
			the ship...

					SISKO
			He immediately made sexual advances.

					MISS SARDA
			He said it was part of the job.

	A beat.  Sisko frowns that special frown he reserves for 
	Quark.

					SISKO
			And what did you say?

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/23/92 - TEASER         2.

1    CONTINUED:

					MISS SARDA
			I told him I'd wear the costume and 
			entertain the gamblers... but to 
			keep his Ferengi knuckles to 
			himself...

					SISKO
			But that didn't stop him... ?

					MISS SARDA
			No, he said again that it was part 
			of the job.

	She hands the PADD to Sisko so he can see the contract for 
	himself, moves beside him and points to a section of small 
	print that we don't need to see...

					MISS SARDA
				(continuing)
			He showed me my employment 
			agreement... see?  There it is in 
			the Ferengi print, on page twenty-
			one, sub-section twelve... paragraph 
			"D"...

					SISKO
				(hard to believe)
			You're telling me the contract you 
			signed requires you to...

					MISS SARDA
			I guess I should have read it more 
			carefully... I'm not a legal expert, 
			Commander...

					SISKO
				(beat)
			I'm not a legal expert either, but I 
			can assure you, after I talk to Quark, 
			he won't hold you, or anyone else, 
			to this provision of...

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Commander, sensors are picking up 
			elevated neutrino readings.  
			Something's coming through the 
			wormhole...

					SISKO
				(reacts)
			Are any of the transports due back?

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Not according to our logs.

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/28/92 - TEASER         3.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			Put us on yellow alert.
				(to Sarda)
			Excuse me...


	She acknowledges, EXITS out the side door... he EXITS into 
	Ops...

2    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	The wormhole illuminates... a small VESSEL of radical design 
	is jettisoned out, careening through space.

3    INT. OPS

	KIRA, DAX and O'BRIEN at their stations... various 
	Supernumeraries at others... they're looking at the O.S.  
	viewscreen...

					DAX
				(checking monitors)
			It doesn't match anything in Starfleet 
			files.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm getting readings of a massive 
			energy flux.  It could be damaged.

					DAX
			Sensors indicate a single humanoid 
			lifeform onboard.

					SISKO
			Hail it.

					O'BRIEN
				(hitting a panel)
			Aye, Sir.
				(beat)
			Hail acknowledged.  Response coming 
			in.

					SISKO
			On screen.

DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER         4.

4    ANGLE - INCLUDING VIEW SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Shows the image of the alien face of TOSK -- a humanoid, but 
	just barely; reptilian skin and bizarre facial features... 
	His ship shakes lightly during the following...

					SISKO
			Welcome to the Alpha Quadrant.  I'm 
			Commander Benjamin Sisko of the United 
			Federation of Planets.

	There is an alert intensity in the alien's eyes and a manner 
	that seems on guard... nervous... on edge...

					TOSK
			Alpha quadrant?

					SISKO
			You have passed through a wormhole 
			into a new part of the galaxy...

					TOSK
			I saw a small ship disappear... I 
			followed it...

					SISKO
			That was one of our patrol vessels... 
			you've travelled almost ninety-
			thousand light years.  What planet 
			do you come from?

					TOSK
				(ignoring the question)
			How long does it last -- this anomaly?

					SISKO
			The wormhole?  It's stable... you 
			can return whenever you want to.  In 
			the meantime, you're welcome to dock 
			here and we'll try to answer all 
			your questions...

					TOSK
				(quick)
			No.  No time...

	The ship suddenly begins vibrating more seriously.  Tosk 
	holds on, steadies himself as he checks his instrument panel.

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/28/92 - TEASER         5.

4    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Inertial stress is overloading his 
			structural capacity.

					SISKO
			Prepare to transport him off his 
			ship.

					TOSK
			I will not abandon my vessel.

	The ship begins vibrating again.

					SISKO
			Sir, your ship is in danger of...

					TOSK
			I will not leave!

					O'BRIEN
			We can use a tractor beam to tow him 
			in.  The beam's graviton field should 
			shore up the structural integrity.

					SISKO
			Do it.

					O'BRIEN
				(to viewscreen)
			Cut your engines.

	With the suspicion of a fox --

					TOSK
			Why?

					O'BRIEN
			So I can save your ship, friend.  
			We'll bring you in... try to fix you 
			up good as new...

	Tosk feels his ship shudder again, decides to cut his 
	engines...

					O'BRIEN
				(soothing, talking 
				him down)
			Good... engaging tractor beam... 
			steady now... you feel the graviton 
			field taking hold?

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/23/92 - TEASER         6.

4    CONTINUED:	(2)

	The shuddering stops...

					TOSK
			Yes.

					O'BRIEN
			You'll be fine now... just relax and 
			enjoy the ride...

	Tosk does not relax for a second... and is unhappy about 
	being in anybody else's hands... O'Brien switches off the 
	viewscreen...

					KIRA
			I'd say that's a man who doesn't 
			know how to relax...
				(to Dax, joking)
			He could use some of your meditation 
			exercises, Lieutenant...

					DAX
				(smiles dryly)
			So could you, Major.  Benjamin, I 
			think we might want to skip formal 
			first contact procedures for now...

					SISKO
			Agreed.
				(to O'Brien)
			Why don't you meet him by yourself 
			at the airlock, Mister O'Brien... he 
			might find that a little less 
			intimidating...

					O'BRIEN
			Aye, sir...

					SISKO
			... And if you can, find out what 
			he's so... nervous about...

	O'Brien acknowledges and as he EXITS on the Turbolift... a 
	beat on Sisko and...

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

8    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	The alien ship has docked.

9    INT. ALIEN COCKPIT

	It's a single pilot vessel.  The hatch opens and O'Brien 
	enters... looks around... there's no one there... O'Brien 
	reacts, hits his combadge...

					O'BRIEN
			O'Brien to Ops...

									INTERCUTTING:

10   INT. OPS

					SISKO
			Go ahead, Chief.

					O'BRIEN
			You didn't beam this fellow out when 
			I wasn't looking, did you?

					SISKO
			Negative.

					O'BRIEN
			Well, he's not in here.

	Sisko reacts, glances at Dax...

					DAX
			The sensors say he's still on board, 
			Chief.

11   INT. ALIEN SHIP

	O'Brien reacts, looks around... his hand goes to a small 
	hand phaser on his hip... but then he thinks again... He 
	again uses the tone of his voice to communicate friendship 
	and non-threat... Throughout their relationship, it's not 
	what O'Brien says that bridges the communication gap, but 
	how he says it...

					O'BRIEN
			Friend, if you're in here... you've 
			got nothing to worry about from me... 
			you understand?

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/27/92 - ACT ONE          8.

11   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)
			I'm just going to look at your ship... 
			see what the problem is, okay... ?

	No response.  It's eerie.  O'Brien takes a beat and moves to 
	a forward section and finds a control on a panel below the 
	pilot's seat... he presses it and it slides open... during 
	the action --

					O'BRIEN
			Now, just so you know... I'm an 
			engineer... I know a little bit about 
			ships... well, more than a little 
			bit actually...

	He slides himself head first into the dark insides of the 
	ship...

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
				(reacting to what he 
				sees)
			Though to be sure, I've never seen 
			anything close to this...

12   ANGLE - ON A WALL AWAY FROM O'BRIEN (OPTICAL)

	Tosk shimmers into view... he moves closer to O'Brien's 
	legs... during the action --

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
			All right, not... is that some sort 
			of plasma injector there... okay... 
			then that would have to be an off-
			axis field controller of some kind... 
			uh-huh... uh-huh...

	Leaning down --

					TOSK
				(casual)
			The coladrium flow has been 
			damaged.

	Startled, O'Brien's legs react and we hear a bump of a head 
	inside the panel...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT ONE          9.

12   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
				(pain)
			Ah!

	He slides out...

					O'BRIEN
			You can't go sneaking up on someone 
			like that, friend... it's an Alpha 
			quadrant rule...

	Tosk examines him with curious alien eyes...

					TOSK
			Can it be fixed?

					O'BRIEN
			Well, that depends...

					TOSK
			Depends?

					O'BRIEN
			On what exactly a coladrium flow 
			is...

					TOSK
				(frustrated)
			On my world, it would be simple... 
			with proper materials I could do 
			this myself...

					O'BRIEN
			Now, hang on, I didn't say we couldn't 
			figure it out... you're just going 
			to have to teach me as we go... I'm 
			sure that...

					TOSK
			I have no time!

					O'BRIEN
			I know... everybody's in a hurry 
			these days... we'll get you on your 
			way as soon as it's humanly 
			possibly...
				(beat)
			Oh, that's me, by the way... human 
			species, name of O'Brien...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT ONE         10.

12   CONTINUED:	(2)

					TOSK
			Oh.  Brien.

					O'BRIEN
			Miles O'Brien, Chief of Operations.  
			How about you?

					TOSK
			I am... Tosk.

					O'BRIEN
			That's your name?  Or you... 
			species... ?

					TOSK
				(confused)
			I am Tosk.

					O'BRIEN
			Tosk, it is.
				(moving toward the 
				exit)
			Come on, then...

	Tosk hesitates...

					O'BRIEN
			There's nothing to be worried about 
			out there.  We've got to let your 
			reactor cool down before we can do 
			anything else anyway...

	Tosk still hesitates.

					O'BRIEN
			Now, Tosk, you know you've got a 
			broken... uh, coladrium flow... and 
			those aren't fixed overnight are 
			they...

	Tosk acknowledges with a slight change of his eyes...

					O'BRIEN
			No reason to just sit in here.  We've 
			got a room for you.  Probably not as 
			nice as you're used to.  But it'll 
			do for now...

	O'Brien moves out the door... turns back... Tosk, like a 
	hesitant dog, doesn't know what to do...

					O'BRIEN
			C'mon... I have work to do...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT ONE         11.

12   CONTINUED:	(3)

	After a beat, Tosk finally follows...

13   INT. AIRLOCK

	Tosk looks around warily as they ENTER from the ship... 
	O'Brien directs him toward the exit...

					O'BRIEN
			So what happened to you, anyway?  
			Looks like you took some sort of 
			shot to your hull.

					TOSK
				(evasive)
			The passage... through the anomaly 
			was very rough.

					O'BRIEN
				(doesn't buy it)
			Yeah, the wormhole can shake you up 
			all right.

14   INT. PROMENADE (OPTICAL)

	As they ENTER from the airlock, they pass through a sensor 
	field... Tosk reacts as the optical flash occurs...

					O'BRIEN
				(explaining)
			Security sensor... screens for 
			weapons... it's just picking up my 
			phaser... you're fine...

					TOSK
			You wear a weapon?

					O'BRIEN
			Defensive purposes only.  It may not 
			seem hospitable.  But going into an 
			alien ship for the first time, you 
			never know what might be inside... 
			may even be someone who can turn 
			himself invisible... know what I 
			mean?

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/29/92 - ACT ONE         12.

14   CONTINUED:

	Tosk studies him... there is no sense of humor there, but 
	he gets the joke and as slight as it is, there is a step 
	forward in the connective process with the simple honest 
	reaction --

					TOSK
			I understand.

15   NEW ANGLE - MOVING WITH THEM

	Tosk reacts to the sights and sounds of the busy Promenade... 
	as they walk, Tosk doesn't just look around, he studies the 
	environment... As they pass the Infirmary, the door is open 
	and Bashir is visible inside... Tosk looks inside...

					TOSK
				(concluding)
			A health center... ?

					O'BRIEN
			Yeah.  That's Doctor Bashir... he 
			looks after all our medical needs...

	As they continue walking...

					TOSK
			How many live here?

					O'BRIEN
			Oh, three hundred more or less...

					TOSK
			What is its purpose?

					O'BRIEN
			Purpose?

					TOSK
			Defense?  Surveillance?

					O'BRIEN
			Well, sometimes when I walk along 
			here, I think we're the flea market 
			to the sector... I guess you could 
			say our real job is to keep an eye 
			on the wormhole... traffic goes in 
			and out all the time now...

					TOSK
			Many ships dock here?

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/27/92 - ACT ONE        12A.

15   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Well, five or six a week... sometimes 
			we get a whole convoy on its way 
			through the wormhole...
				(beat)
			But you have the honor of being the 
			first visitor from the other side...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/27/92 - ACT ONE         13.

15   CONTINUED:	(2)

					TOSK
				(thoughtful)
			Others will detect ships from your 
			quadrant as I did... and follow them 
			here...

					O'BRIEN
			We hop so.
				(off Tosk's reaction)
			Our mission as Starfleet officers... 
			is to seek out new lifeforms... so 
			we can learn about one another...

16   NEW ANGLE

	They come to Quark's... the door is open... Quark is escorting 
	an alien women from the gambling tables toward the door...

					QUARK
			Madame, I distinctly saw you move 
			your wager to the green line after 
			the play was completed... I will 
			return your currency but you will 
			promptly leave the establishment... 
			you are no longer welcome...

17   ANGLE - TOSK

	reacts curiously...

					O'BRIEN
			Well, there are a few things to learn 
			about us that can wait...

	They continue walking...

					O'BRIEN
			How about you?
				(off Tosk's reaction)
			Are you... an explorer... a 
			scientist... ?

					TOSK
			I am Tosk.

					O'BRIEN
			Right.

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/28/92 - ACT ONE         14.

18   INT. TOSK'S QUARTERS (VIDEO PLAY BACK)

	As they enter...

					O'BRIEN
			Computer, lights...

	The lights come on...

					O'BRIEN
			I wasn't the decorator.

					TOSK
				(impatient)
			I wish to begin work on my ship.

					O'BRIEN
			We'll get started as soon as we can... 
			Now, why don't you get some rest...

					TOSK
			I require only seventeen minutes of 
			sleep per rotation.

					O'BRIEN
			Seventeen... no kidding... if I don't 
			get a good eight hours a night, I'm 
			not the same man... are you hungry?

					TOSK
			Hungry?

					O'BRIEN
			You know, do you want something to 
			eat, take in sustenance...

					TOSK
			Liquid nutrients have been stored in 
			plasmic fibers throughout my body...

					O'BRIEN
			Well, the food replicator is over 
			here if you change your mind... we've 
			finally got it making a pretty good 
			bowl of oatmeal.  Just ask the 
			computer for anything else you need.

	Tosk studies him a beat...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/28/92 - ACT ONE         15.

					TOSK
			Oh Brien.
				(beat)
			Thank-you.

					O'BRIEN
			As the Vulcans say, we're here to 
			serve.

	He exits.  We stay a beat on Tosk.  He looks around for a 
	beat, still nervous, still on edge...

20   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	O'Brien reporting back to Sisko on his impressions...

					O'BRIEN
			It's hard to say, sir... he is an 
			alien and you hate to prejudge 
			anyone...

					SISKO
			What're you thinking, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			Well, there's an old saying back 
			home... "a man who's always lookin' 
			over his shoulder is waiting for 
			trouble to find him." (Research: a 
			real Irish saying to replace this 
			would be nice.)

					SISKO
			You think he's on the run... ?

					O'BRIEN
				(shrugs)
			I'll tell you this -- he wasn't 
			telling the whole truth about the 
			damage to his ship... it sure wasn't 
			caused by the wormhole.  Somebody 
			took a shot at him... came in at a 
			45 degree angle to the hull... sliced 
			through two propulsion systems... 
			I'll know more when I get a better 
			look...

					SISKO
				(nods, thoughtfully)
			Stay with him as much as possible 
			while he's here... I'll tell Odo to 
			keep an eye on him too...

					O'BRIEN
			Aye, sir...

	He EXITS...

			No... the coladrium flows through

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
			Uh-uh... and where's that...

					TOSK (O.S.)
			The Arva Nodes... here...

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
			These coils... ?

23   INT. HULL - DARK TIGHT TWO SHOT

	surrounded by dark engine equipment... O'Brien uses a palm 
	beacon to look at what they're talking about... we may not 
	even need to see, it's so tight...

					O'BRIEN
			What are they... some kind of high-
			energy magnetic coils?

	Tosk reacts like he's listening to a foreign language...

					TOSK
			Ah... for fuel replenishment... 
			fuel... ?
				(you understand?)

					O'BRIEN
			Like a ramscoop...

					TOSK
			Ramscoop... ?

					O'BRIEN
			To capture stellar gases and convert 
			them into usable fuel...

23   CONTINUED:

					TOSK
				(connection made)
			Yes!  The Arva Nodes convert space 
			matter into fuel!

					O'BRIEN
			Gotcha.  Piece of cake.

					TOSK
				(with misplaced 
				confidence)
			Pieceofcake.  Ramscoop.  Arva Nodes.

					O'BRIEN
			Ah, "piece of cake" - it's just an 
			old human expression.  Means they'll 
			be easy to fix.

					TOSK
			They will be easy to fix?

					O'BRIEN
			Sure, we'll just get my crew to remove 
			your Arva Nodes, then we'll take 
			them over to the replicator center 
			and make new ones...

					TOSK
				(pleased)
			Piece of cake.

24   INT. TOSK'S SHIP

	As they crawl out...

					TOSK
			How long?

					O'BRIEN
			Maybe a day or two.  We'll want to 
			run some tests after we have the 
			replacement unit in...

					TOSK
			No.  No time for that.

					O'BRIEN
			Hey, I let you take this unit out 
			without proper testing...

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/23/92 - ACT TWO       19.

24   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			it breaks down and you blame me... 
			next thing I know my work has a bad 
			reputation in the Gamma quadrant...

					TOSK
			I would not blame you.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm joking, Tosk.

					TOSK
				(beat)
			I cannot tell.  Oh Brien.

					O'BRIEN
				(beat, smiles)
			Sorry.  It's just in my nature.  And 
			you're the most natural straight man 
			I've met in ages... c'mon, while the 
			fellas are working here, I'll buy 
			you a drink... and you can tell me 
			why you're in such a rush...

25   INT. QUARK'S ESTABLISHMENT

	O'Brien and Tosk ENTER... taking in the atmosphere of the 
	activities...

					TOSK
			Nothing like this exists on my world.

					O'BRIEN
			This is where we do most of our R 
			and R...

					TOSK
			What is R and R...

					O'BRIEN
			Rest and relaxation.  You know, down 
			time.  When we're not working.

	They sit at the bar...

					TOSK
			You sleep a full third of your 
			rotation.  You rest and relax while 
			you are awake.
				(beat)
			The Alpha quadrant has too much... 
			"down" time.

25   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			My wife would laugh at that.  She's 
			barely seen me in the last three 
			weeks.

					TOSK
			We are very different, Tosk and Oh 
			Brien.

					O'BRIEN
			I've noticed.  Hey barkeep!

	Quark reacts, comes over...

					QUARK
			Don't call me "barkeep."  I am not a 
			barkeep.  I am your host, the 
			proprietor, a sympathetic ear to the 
			wretched souls who pass through these 
			portals...

					O'BRIEN
				(to Tosk)
			... And a man who will exploit any vice 
			you may have.  Two synthales, barkeep.

					TOSK
			I am sorry, I have no vices for you 
			to exploit.

					QUARK
				(glances to O'Brien)
			A challenge.

					O'BRIEN
			Tosk is our first guest from the 
			Gamma Quadrant, Quark.  I'd take him 
			at his work.

					QUARK
				(never give up)
			Perhaps a short adventure in a 
			holosuite...

					TOSK
			Holosuite... ?

					QUARK
			A fantasy encounter with danger, 
			romance, thrills... created for your 
			personal entertainment by the Quark 
			Brothers...

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/23/92 - ACT TWO       21.

25   CONTINUED:	(2)

					TOSK
			I have no use for fantasy adventure.  
			I live the greatest adventure one 
			could ever desire.

	O'Brien raises an eyebrow at that.  Quark exchanges a glance 
	with him.

					QUARK
			Then, I envy you, Mister Tosk.

	He moves away.

					O'BRIEN
			What are you talking about, Tosk... 
			what is this adventure you're on?

					TOSK
			I cannot discuss it.

					O'BRIEN
			Oh.  Sure, of course.
				(long beat, 
				irresistible)
			I mean, by the way you act, it's 
			some kind of dangerous adventure, am 
			I right?

					TOSK
			I cannot discuss it.

					O'BRIEN
			Sure.  Sorry.

	A beat.  Tosk glances at O'Brien... feeling an equally 
	irresistible impulse to share the experience with his new 
	friend...

					TOSK
				(the answer to your 
				question)
			Yes.

					O'BRIEN
			Dangerous.

					TOSK
				(shrugs, of course)
			I am Tosk.

26   INT. OPS

	Sisko, Kira, Dax, Bashir... O'Brien is struggling to put 
	into context what he knows... maybe sitting at the Ops 
	table...

					KIRA
			Sounds like you've changed your mind 
			about him, Chief...

					O'BRIEN
			Not exactly.  I mean, he's running 
			from something... that's for sure... 
			and he's in danger... and he can't 
			or won't talk about it...

					BASHIR
			People tell doctors things they never 
			tell any one else... if you could 
			talk him into having a routine medical 
			examination, maybe I could...

					O'BRIEN
				(ignoring and 
				interrupting Bashir)
			The thing is... I kind of like the 
			guy... I'm not even sure why... in a 
			way, he's almost naive... I guess 
			any one would be in an alien 
			environment... but... I don't sense 
			a thread of criminal intent or 
			dishonesty about him...

					SISKO
			I thought you said he lied about the 
			damage to his ship...

					O'BRIEN
			Well, he didn't exactly lie...

					DAX
			But he didn't exactly tell the truth 
			either...

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/27/92 - ACT TWO       23.

26   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			He keeps the truth pretty much to 
			himself.

					SISKO
			When will his ship be ready?

					O'BRIEN
			Tomorrow.

					SISKO
			I don't see that we have much of a 
			choice.  We can't hold him.  If he 
			wants to tell you the truth, fine.  
			If not, wish him well... and send 
			him on his way...

	O'Brien acknowledges, still unsettled about this curious 
	visitor and...

	down the corridor where...

36   ODO

					ODO
			When you get tired of bouncing off

36A  ANGLE

	At both ends of the corridor, Bajoran deputies arrive behind 
	the forcefields...

37   ANGLE

					TOSK
			I've done nothing to you.

        DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/27/92 - ACT TWO       25.

37   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			It's that security junction I'm 
			curious about.

					TOSK
			I must prepare.

					ODO
			For what.

					TOSK
			I cannot discuss it.  I am Tosk.

					ODO
			I'm sure you are.  Why don't we go 
			down to my office while your friend 
			Chief O'Brien takes a look to see 
			just what you were doing in there...

					TOSK
			Oh Brien.

					ODO
			Right.  I'm going to release the 
			forcefields now... I don't need a 
			fight from you... understand?

					TOSK
			I will not fight you...

					ODO
			Good.  Computer, release the security

	We hear the sound of the release... The deputies move in at 
	Odo's signal and escort Tosk away... On Odo's look...

	Tosk is in a holding cell behind a forcefield... Sisko 
	questions him... Odo in the background... O'Brien ENTERS 
	early in the scene, waits to be acknowledged by Sisko... 
	Tosk, in his cell, paces like a trapped animal -- this is 
	the worst possible thing that can happen to a Tosk...

					TOSK
			I cannot discuss it.

					SISKO
			... And I can't accept that as an 
			answer...

					TOSK
			I did nothing to you.

	In his fervor, he accidentally bumps into the forcefield 
	creating an optical flash.

					SISKO
			You were tampering with the security 
			grid... I consider that a threat...

	He turns to see O'Brien, asks him what he knows with his 
	eyes... O'Brien moves forward, looks at Tosk as he talks...

					O'BRIEN
			I think he was trying to shut down 
			the lock-outs to Section Three...

					ODO
			The weapons locker...

	Sisko frowns, looks back at Tosk...

			What were you going to do with the

	Tosk looks away.

			Are you wanted by authorities

					TOSK
			Wanted?

					ODO
			Have you committed crimes?

					TOSK
				(shocked at the 
				accusation)
			Never.  I am Tosk.

					SISKO
			What does that mean?  Is that supposed 
			to explain all this?

					TOSK
			It is all I can say.

					O'BRIEN
			Tosk, don't you think we deserve 
			some answers?

	Tosk looks at O'Brien, but offers nothing more... Sisko sighs, 
	shakes his head, moves way...

					ODO
			What should I do with him?

					SISKO
			Hold him for now.  We'll wait to see 
			if someone shows up looking for him.

	Sisko EXITS.  Odo glances back at O'Brien, moves to leave 
	them alone...

					O'BRIEN
			Enough of this craziness, Tosk... 
			tell me what the hell you were 
			doing...

					TOSK
			Oh Brien.  You must let me out.

					O'BRIEN
			Tell me!

			Allow me to die with honor.

	Off O'Brien's reaction...

40   INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	As O'Brien comes out of the holding area... Odo looks up, 
	sees the disturbed look on O'Brien's face... O'Brien slumps 
	down in a chair across from Odo's desk...

					O'BRIEN
			He's climbing the walls... like a 
			trapped animal...

					ODO
			Sorry our jail cells aren't to his 
			liking.

	A beat...

					O'BRIEN
			Somehow, I feel responsible.

					ODO
			You do... ?

					O'BRIEN
			Yeah.  I guess I kinda adopted him.  
			Talked him into coming on board...

					ODO
			You didn't talk him into breaking 
			into the security system...

					O'BRIEN
			I just feel sorry for him.  Somehow, 
			I don't think he means us any harm.

	He stands up... to himself more than Odo --

			I have Tosk... alive.

71   INT. PROMENADE (OPTICAL)

	The aliens lower their weapons, no longer attempting to move 
	forward.  The firing has stopped.  With their faces still 
	covered by helmets, they glance at each other, reacting with 
	shock to the word "alive."

					THE HUNTER'S COM VOICE
			It is over.

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/27/92 - ACT FOUR        37.

71   CONTINUED:

	Kira and the others react as the aliens hit their 
	communicators and DEMATERIALIZE.

72   INT. HOLDING AREA

	The Hunter addresses the Tosk directly with contempt...

					THE HUNTER
			What a disappointment... after such 
			an entertaining beginning...

					SISKO
				(furious)
			Entertaining... ?

					THE HUNTER
				(ignoring him)
			These aliens gave us a great deal of 
			resistance... we wondered how you 
			got their cooperation without 
			violating your oath of silence...

					TOSK
				(small satisfaction)
			I told them nothing.

					THE HUNGER
			But, to see you here, caged and 
			helpless... how could you allow this?

	Tosk just hangs his head... O'Brien studies the incredible 
	exchange...

					THE HUNTER
				(continuing)
			It is a disgrace to all Tosk.  And 
			the most disappointing hunt in 
			memory...

	That's too much for Sisko to bear... he steps forward between 
	Tosk and the Hunter...

					SISKO
			You're saying that this whole thing... 
			is a hunt... and Tosk is the prey...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT FOUR        38.

72   CONTINUED:

	The Hunter studies this minor lifeform and finally 
	addresses it directly...

					THE HUNTER
			You are right... this Tosk is unworthy 
			of such a noble description.
				(to Tosk)
			For this dishonor, you will endure 
			the greatest humiliation Tosk can 
			know... to be captured and brought 
			home alive.  You will live out your 
			existence on public display... where 
			children will make fun of you and 
			toss you scraps of food...

	He turns to Sisko...

					THE HUNTER
			Release him.

	And now Sisko takes charge... moves to confront the alien...

					SISKO
			You've disrupted life on this 
			station... for the pleasure of your... 
			"hunt"... I'm not inclined to take 
			any orders from you.
				(to Odo)
			Odo, watch the prisoner while our 
			"guest" and I discuss this matter in 
			private...
				(to The Hunter)
			... unless you intend to take him by 
			force... in which case I am prepared 
			to give orders to open fire on your 
			ship...

	The alien looks at this group with incredulity --

					THE HUNTER
			Over this Tosk?

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT FOUR        39.

72   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Sisko gives him a look that says that's right... and 
	EXITS... The Hunter looks at the other two who stare him 
	down evenly... and after a beat he follows Sisko out... Tosk, 
	miserable, avoids O'Brien's look...

73   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	The Hunter follows an enraged Sisko into his office... they've 
	already been talking on the way...

					THE HUNTER
			... Have you nothing like this in 
			your own society?

					SISKO
			Centuries ago, people on my world 
			engaged in bloodsports... killing 
			lower species for pleasure.  A few 
			cultures still do.  But even they 
			wouldn't consider hunting a sentient 
			being...

					THE HUNTER
				(casual, obvious to 
				him)
			He is only sentient because we have 
			made him sentient.  He has been bred 
			for the hunt.  His entire reason to 
			exist is the hunt... to make it as 
			interesting, as exciting as he can.
				(off Sisko's look)
			Obviously, you do not comprehend...

					SISKO
			I comprehend just fine.  I have no 
			tolerance for the abuse of any 
			lifeform.

					THE HUNTER
			Abuse?  We honor Tosk.  They are the 
			symbol of all that is noble and 
			courageous.  They train and condition 
			themselves all their lives for this 
			event.  They are proud of their role 
			in our culture.

	A beat... and this is the Starfleet training coming out in 
	him... he backs off a little... he really has to...

					SISKO
			I can't judge what is right and wrong 
			for your world.  But on this 
			station...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/27/92 - ACT FOUR        40.

73   CONTINUED:

					THE HUNTER
			In the future, passage through the 
			anomaly will be considered out of 
			bounds for the hunt... will that 
			satisfy you?

	Sisko studies him evenly.  It will have to satisfy him.

					THE HUNTER
			Now, you will arrange for the release 
			of the Tosk.

	Sisko has nothing more to say than a nod... the alien 
	acknowledges and hits his communicator and DEMATERIALIZES.

74   INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS

	Sisko walks out of his office...

					SISKO
			I've agreed to release him.

					O'BRIEN
				(reacts)
			But sir, Tosk is a living, intelligent 
			being...

					SISKO
			This is their custom, Chief... under 
			the prime directive, we have no right 
			to interfere...

					KIRA
			What if Tosk were to request asylum?

	Sisko takes a long beat to think... looks back at O'Brien...

					SISKO
			If he asks for it...

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT FOUR        41.

74   CONTINUED:

	That's all he has to say... O'Brien understands, nods and 
	then EXITS...

75   INT. HOLDING AREA


	O'Brien ENTERS, slightly out of breath... Tosk looks up...

					O'BRIEN
			All right, I have a way out for you...

					TOSK
			A way... out.  Of here?
				(meaning the cell)

					O'BRIEN
			Request asylum.

					TOSK
				(unclear)
			Asylum.

					O'BRIEN
			Ask for the protection of the 
			Federation.  Do you understand?  My 
			Commander is willing to protect you.

	Tosk looks disappointed... into O'Brien's eyes... don't you 
	understand?  --

					TOSK
			Oh Brien.  I am Tosk.  I cannot hide 
			here behind the protection of your 
			Federation.  It is against everything 
			I believe.

					O'BRIEN
			You'd rather go back and live in a 
			cage on public display... ?

					TOSK
			To stay would be a greater dishonor.  
			I am Tosk, the hunted.

         DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" - 10/23/92 - ACT FOUR        42.

75   CONTINUED:

					TOSK
			I live to outwit the hunters... for 
			another day... to survive until I 
			die with honor.
				(beat)
			Now that will not be my fate.  But I 
			will not deny my existence as Tosk.  
			Thank-you, Oh Brien but I cannot 
			request... asylum.

	On O'Brien's reaction...

77   INT. QUARK'S ESTABLISHMENT

	O'Brien frustrated, moves into the bar... Quark moves over...

					QUARK
			So far, I'm not impressed with the 
			tourist trade from the Gamma 
			Quadrant... not one of them has bought 
			a single drink...

	Clearly in a lousy mood --

					O'BRIEN
			Shut up, Quark.

	As he serves O'Brien an ale --

					QUARK
				(beat, a sympathetic 
				shoulder)
			More trouble with the little woman...

	O'Brien reaches across the bar and grabs him by the lapels... 
	pulls him against the bar...

					O'BRIEN
			What's that supposed to mean?

					QUARK
			Nothing... nothing... I just thought 
			you might want to talk...

					O'BRIEN
			... there's nothing wrong between me 
			and my wife and if there was, I sure 
			as hell wouldn't talk about it to 
			some barkeep...

	O'Brien pushes him away with disdain...

					QUARK
			Sorry.  My mistake.

       DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/23/92 - ACT FIVE       44.

77   CONTINUED:

	Quark stays and studies O'Brien as he takes a drink... 
	O'Brien glares at him.

					O'BRIEN
			What?

					QUARK
			Your face gets very pink when you're 
			aggravated... much more so than most 
			other hew-mans...

					O'BRIEN
			Then stop aggravating me!

					QUARK
			No... no... no... no... not me.  You 
			came in the door this way.

					O'BRIEN
			Fine.  You're right.  I'm... 
			aggravated.

					QUARK
				(pleased with himself)
			I'm a keen observer of behavior.
				(beat)
			Want to talk about it?

					O'BRIEN
			No.

					QUARK
			Why not?

					O'BRIEN
			Because talking to you won't help 
			anything.

					QUARK
			Try me.

					O'BRIEN
			Forget it.  It's just the rules of 
			the game.

					QUARK
			Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Rules of the game.  
			Go on.

       DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/27/92 - ACT FIVE       45.

					O'BRIEN
			It's a damn hunt, didja know that... 
			they're chasing Tosk in a hunt... 
			and everybody's playing by the 
			rules... they're playing by their 
			rules, we're playing by ours... and 
			he gets caught in the middle...

					QUARK
				(has no idea what 
				O'Brien is talking 
				about)
			Uh-huh.

					O'BRIEN
			Of course, I suppose when the Ferengi 
			don't like the rules... they just 
			change them...

	O'Brien takes a swallow and the thought hits him as the ale 
	hits his throat as Quark fumbles on...

					QUARK
			Well, rules... rules are always 
			subject to inter--...

					O'BRIEN
				(interrupting)
			Of course... change the rules... why 
			didn't I think of that...

	He plops the mug on the bar with an exclamation point...

					O'BRIEN
			Thanks, barkeep.

	And EXITS... Quark looks after O'Brien a beat and then moves 
	a few meters down the bar to another depressed customer...

					QUARK
			So what's bothering you today?

	A quick beat and...

	As a neck manacle is snapped into place around Tosk's neck... 
	connected to a metal tether... moving back to find Odo and 
	the Hunter without his helmet on... but carrying his crossbow 
	across his shoulder...

					ODO
			That isn't necessary.

					THE HUNTER
			Our ritual requires it when a Tosk 
			is captured alive.

	O'Brien ENTERS wearing a large phaser, Tosk looks up to see 
	him...

					ODO
			All right... let's go...

					O'BRIEN
			I'll be escorting the prisoner to 
			the transporter station.

					ODO
				(the hell you are)
			This is a security matter...

					O'BRIEN
				(overriding)
			This is a Starfleet matter.  Orders 
			from Sisko.

					ODO
				(reacts)
			We'll see about that.

	And EXITS... the Hunter is bored with all of this --

       DEEP SPACE: "Captive Pursuit" REV. 10/27/92 - ACT FIVE       47.

83   CONTINUED:

					THE HUNTER
			Do not trouble yourself.  My ship 
			can transport us.

					O'BRIEN
			Nossir, that won't be necessary.  
			Good relations with other cultures 
			is our highest priority.  Commander 
			Sisko wants to make sure you 
			understand we're sorry we interfered

			Very well.

	As they leave, O'Brien casually tosses his combadge on Odo's

			I'm talking about your ordering

86   INT. PROMENADE

	As the Hunter walks with customary pride with his Tosk at 
	the end of the chain... the few people around glance oddly 
	at him... O'Brien leads them to one of the exits...

					O'BRIEN
			This way...

	And we may recognize the security check point with the 
	screening device that O'Brien and Tosk went through earlier 
	in the show just ahead...

87   ANGLE ON THE HUNTER'S WEAPON

	on his shoulder... and as O'Brien allows him to move through 
	the screening device, this time there is...

88   WIDER (OPTICAL)

	A huge optical flash that we will assume O'Brien has 
	programmed... that stuns them... The Hunter drops the chain.  
	O'Brien, prepared, steadies himself, and then as The Hunter 
	reacts, O'Brien swings a fist that connects with his jaw and 
	he crumples down... the crossbow falling to his side...

					O'BRIEN
			Glass jaw.  Now, I know why you wear 
			a helmet.

	He stamps on the crossbow, smashing some component, then pushes 
	Tosk toward a nearby staircase...

					O'BRIEN
			Up there!

	As they run up the stairs...

89   ANGLE ON THE HUNTER

	dazed, rubbing his chin... hits his communicator...

					THE HUNTER

			The hunt has resumed!

	And he smiles as he gets back on his feet...

			C'mon... your ship is ready...

	He leads Tosk ahead at a fast clip when one of the hunters 
	MATERIALIZES in front of them, raising his weapon.  Before 
	O'Brien has a chance to draw his phaser, Tosk does an 
	incredible leap, several yards long, into the alien as the 
	weapon discharges up in the sky and the alien falls over the 
	railing...

90A  LOW ANGLE

	chooses not to make eye contact...

98   INT. CARDASSIAN ACCESS TUBE (OPTICAL)

	O'Brien and Tosk in the cramped area... out of breath... 
	O'Brien takes a beat to fire his phaser at close range, 
	freeing the neck manacle from Tosk's neck... Tosk looks at 
	O'Brien with appreciation...

					TOSK
			You are Tosk as well now, Oh Brien...

	O'Brien gives him a short grin as he leads the way, they 
	begin to scramble forward... getting grimy and dirty as they 
	go...

	Suddenly, several yards directly ahead a huge charge explodes

					O'BRIEN
			... until now.

	They turn back to retreat, but another charge explodes at 
	their rear... They scramble to their left into another leg 
	of the tube, moving into a cube where they see a hatch 
	below... they look down... begin to remove the hatch...

99   INT. CORRIDOR NUMBER ONE

	Another alien arrives on foot as Tosk drops down on him from 
	the ceiling, followed immediately by O'Brien... the alien is 
	dazed and drops his weapon and Tosk picks it up... as O'Brien 
	scrambles to his feet and they run down the corridor and 
	EXIT...

100  INT. CORRIDOR NUMBER TWO (OPTICAL)

	As they ENTER, out of breath... see a clear path to freedom...

	But as they take their first jogs in that direction... three

			No.  He's mine.

			The hunt goes on.

	He moves to get into his seat... pauses as he has an 
	additional thought --

					TOSK
			You wish to come?

					O'BRIEN
			No... no... I don't think so... one 
			day as a Tosk is enough for me... 
			and I have a wife and kid that

					TOSK
			Will your Federation punish you for 
			helping me?

					O'BRIEN
			Maybe.  But if I know my Commander...
				(beat)
			Hell, those guys wanted a hunt.  I 
			just gave them one.

	They exchange a smile.

					O'BRIEN

			Go on, you better get out of here

					O'BRIEN
			The weapons' sensors must have

					O'BRIEN
			Well, sir... I'm not one to say.  
			But you know, these... hunters weren't

			You ignored your duty to Starfleet...

					O'BRIEN
			I understand.

	Sisko nods... the conversation is over.  O'Brien rises, 
	pauses, curious...

					O'BRIEN
			I was surprised by one thing, sir.

					SISKO
			What's that?

					O'BRIEN
			I knew I couldn't override all the

			figured once you and the Constable 
			located us... well, that it would be

					SISKO

			I guess that one got by us.
