Title: The Killing Game, Part 2
Stardate: 51715.2
Original Airdate: April 3, 1998


[Corridor] JANEWAY: Looks like the Hirogen have been busy. This entire
section has been equipped with holo-emitters. Let's get to Astrometrics.

[Astrometrics]

SEVEN: There are eighty five Hirogen on board concentrated on decks two
through nine.
JANEWAY: What about the bridge?
SEVEN: Four Hirogen and Ensign Kim.
JANEWAY: At least he's alive. The neural interfaces, you said they're
controlled through Sickbay.
SEVEN: Yes. There's only one Hirogen in Sickbay with the Doctor, but the
corridors outside are heavily guarded.
JANEWAY: That's our first objective, disable the interfaces. But we'll
need help.
SEVEN: We did have allies in the World War two simulation. The French
Resistance.
JANEWAY: It's time we mount a resistance of our own.

[Bridge]

KIM: The damage is concentrated here, on Holodeck one, but the fighting
has spilled out onto decks five and six and it looks like a group of
holographic Americans is invading deck seven.
ALPHA: Show me the breach in the hologrid.
KIM: I've lost the visual link. It was the last active circuit connecting
the Bridge to the Holodecks. There's only one way to stop this. I need to
go to Engineering and initiate a power surge across the holo-emitter
network. It'll blow out the entire system.
ALPHA: No. That would destroy both the holodecks.
KIM: Look, simulation or not, if this battle keeps going we could all be
killed.
ALPHA: I want that technology preserved.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Commander.
ALPHA: Status.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: I was able to reach deck five but holographic forces
are massing near the breach. If I'm to get into the holodeck I'll need
help.
ALPHA: Take the hunters from the Klingon simulation.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: When I find Captain Janeway, should I kill her?
ALPHA: No. Bring her to me.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: This is no longer a game. This hunt is real. We
should kill the Prey.
ALPHA: The Voyager crew must remain alive to make repairs, or we could
lose everything! This vessel, it's technology! You said that you
understood the importance of what we're doing here.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: I'll get the hunters.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

CHAKOTAY: We think it's a secret compound the Nazi's built after they
took over the city. What I don't understand is how they managed to
camouflage it so well.
TUVOK: Indeed. We've been scruitinising German troop movements since the
Occupation. We knew nothing of this installation.
PARIS: Don't sweat it. Our recon planes missed it too. Any idea what
they're hiding in there, Captain?
CHAKOTAY: We saw all sorts of scientific equipment. Strange metals,
instruments we can't identify. I've relayed the findings to Military
Intelligence. They believe this could be an advanced munitions
laboratory, designed to build some kind of super-weapon.
PARIS: We've got to put it out of business.
CHAKOTAY: I've already sent three squads in, but the Nazi's are putting
up one hell of a fight. I've requested additional troops. Lieutenant,
this restaurant will serve as our command post. Set up the transmitter
and post guards around the perimeter.
PARIS: Yes, sir. CHAKOTAY: You've done a bang-up job, but we'll take it
from here. Tell your people to lie low and that the Americans said thanks.
TORRES: This is our city. We have no intention of lying low.
CHAKOTAY: Listen, honey, the time for sneaking messages back and forth is
over. This is war, and you aren't soldiers.
TUVOK: He's right. We have weapons hidden throughout the city. Brigitte
will tell you where they are.
CHAKOTAY: Sounds good. Lieutenant, take care of it.
PARIS: I can see you haven't changed.
TORRES: Bring me one of those street maps. Most of the guns we stole from
the German army, the explosives we bought on the black market.
PARIS: We could use both.
TORRES: Our biggest stockpile is buried here, two metres below the last
row of seats of the Cinema Mystere. You remember it, don't you?
PARIS: Hmm. I'm No Angel with Mae West. There's heavy fighting in that
area. What's the best way in?
TORRES: We dug a tunnel that leads directly to the stockpile. Here, I'll
show you. Incidentally, we saw Death Takes a Holiday.
PARIS: It was the Mae West movie, I'm sure of it. She was singing Sister
Honky Tonk, and I put my arm around you. And during the courtroom scene,
I kissed you.
TORRES: You know, I think you're right.
PARIS: I guess the experience wasn't exactly burned into your memory.
TORRES: Not the movie, but I do remember the kiss.
PARIS: So, did you get my last letter?
TORRES: You mean the one asking me to leave France?
PARIS: Germany was about to invade. I thought you'd be safer back in the
States with me, but, I guess you found someone else to take care of you.
TORRES: There's never been anybody else.
PARIS: Then who?
TORRES: He's second in command of the Sainte Claire occupation. The first
time he saw me, he said I was pretty. I took advantage of his interest.
He doesn't know I'm in the Resistance. The child is his.
PARIS: I'm sorry.
TORRES: So am I.
JANEWAY: Hold your fire.
TUVOK: Katrine, you survived.
JANEWAY: Are you surprised?
TUVOK: Very. Nazi headquarters was destroyed. We assumed you were killed
in the explosion.
TORRES: What is that? Some kind of an escape tunnel?
SEVEN: That's precisely what it is.
CHAKOTAY: You're the leader of the local Resistance.
JANEWAY: That's right.
CHAKOTAY: Captain Miller, Fifth Armoured Infantry. This is Lieutenant
Davis. I take it you've seen the German bunker we uncovered.
JANEWAY: I just came from there.
CHAKOTAY: We suspect it's a munitions lab. Can you confirm that?
JANEWAY: Yes. A munitions lab.
CHAKOTAY: Then this is it. We're calling in an air strike. Contact the
RAF.
JANEWAY: Hold on, Captain. There's an easier way to do this with the
minimum of casualties.
CHAKOTAY: Let's hear it.
JANEWAY: I've located the generator that powers the entire complex. It's
heavily guarded but with your help I can get close enough to set off some
explosives.
CHAKOTAY: My orders are to blow the entire compound before the Germans
send in reinforcements.
JANEWAY: I saw technology in there you can't begin to imagine. Warheads
powerful enough to destroy this entire valley if they're accidentally
detonated. Call for an air strike, it may be the last call you make.
CHAKOTAY: How can you get close enough?
JANEWAY: This tunnel. I've been watching this compound for several
months, and I've got a man inside.
PARIS: The place is crawling with Krauts.
JANEWAY: And that's why I need your help. If your men can clear these two
corridors it'll give us access to this entryway. Get me there, and I can
take care of the rest.
CHAKOTAY: C Company. What's there status?
PARIS: They're holding position about two hundred yards from here.
CHAKOTAY: Get them on the horn. You'll lead us into the compound but I'm
coming with you.
JANEWAY: I work better alone.
CHAKOTAY: This isn't a request, it's an order.
JANEWAY: Order? Do I look like I'm wearing one of your uniforms? I go
alone.
CHAKOTAY: I thought you needed our help. I'll be right behind you.
JANEWAY: Even if I manage to disrupt the neural interfaces, we've still
got a war to fight. We're going to need something a lot more effective
than these old firearms.
SEVEN: I believe I can enhance these weapons using Borg technology, but
I'll have to access Cargo Bay two.
JANEWAY: If something goes wrong and I don't succeed, you'll be the only
one left who knows what's really going on.
SEVEN: Understood.
TUVOK: Have our suspicions been confirmed?
JANEWAY: Suspicions?
TUVOK: Is she a collaborator?
JANEWAY: I think we can trust her.
TUVOK: Are you certain? Three hours ago you were prepared to put a bullet
in her head.
JANEWAY: She's on our side.
TUVOK: In your absence I may be forced to make that determination for
myself.
JANEWAY: I've already made it. You're not to harm her. Is that understood?
TUVOK: German forces are advancing on our position.
CHAKOTAY: Let's give them a warm welcome. Mademoiselle, after you.

[Sickbay]

EMH: Punctured lung, arterial rupture, fracture of the thirteenth
vertebra. He needs surgery.
HIROGEN MEDIC: First and second degree burns to the face and neck. Treat
him.
EMH: His injuries are minor. He can wait.
HIROGEN MEDIC: I said treat him.
EMH: This man has massive internal injuries. If I don't operate now,
he'll die!
HIROGEN MEDIC: Treat the burns, or I'll deactivate your programme.
EMH: What kind of physician are you? The first rule of triage states that
the critical injuries take priority.
HIROGEN MEDIC: You're rules, not mine. From now on, leave the wounded
prey where they fall. Tend only to our own.

[Holodeck two - Klingon programme]

NEELIX: I'm as dry as the crater at Tarpahk. In the middle of the dry
season. When it's dry!
KLINGON: No! I'm not done!
NEELIX: Share with your brothers! It's the eve of battle. I may be drunk
but I can still send your soul to the next world and leave your body here
to rot! Though from the stench of it, I'd say it's begun to already!

[Corridor]

KIM: Tom!
PARIS: Wrong guy. You speak English?
KIM: Yeah. I speak English.
PARIS: American?
KIM: I didn't see him coming. You saved my life.
PARIS: Why are you out of uniform? What Company are you with?
KIM: Well, er, I'm a civilian.
PARIS: In the middle of a battle zone in France? The hell you are. Go
one, I'm right behind you. Look, I don't have time for twenty questions.
You say you're an American? All right then. If Betty Grable came around
that corner, what part of her would you be staring at? Sorry. Time's up.
KIM: Her legs! I'd be staring at her legs.
PARIS: Bull's-eye, lucky for you.

[Jefferies tube]

CHAKOTAY: You're a gung ho kind of gal, aren't ya?
JANEWAY: Does that bother you?
CHAKOTAY: Nope. Just not used to it, that's all. The girls back home are
a little different.
JANEWAY: I guess when it comes to my people's safety, this girl tends to
get a little gung ho.
CHAKOTAY: Nothing to apologise for, I'm the same way with my men. There's
not a day goes by when I don't think to myself, I'm going to get 'em back
safely, even if I die trying.
JANEWAY: I know the feeling. We're about to enter some caves that run
under the town.
CHAKOTAY: Caves?
JANEWAY: We're going to meet our contact there. I should warn you, there
are eccentric people who live in the caves, but don't be alarmed.

[Holodeck two - Klingon programme]

JANEWAY: Good evening, gentlemen.
NEELIX: Who are you? How did you get past our battle lines?
JANEWAY: We're friends, allies.
NEELIX: Sent by what house?
JANEWAY: The house of Toh'Marg.
NEELIX: Toh'Marg. I never heard of it.
JANEWAY: I'm not surprised. It's a long way from here.
NEELIX: This battle doesn't concern you.
JANEWAY: Maybe not, but we'd be honoured to fight alongside such great
warriors. If you prefer, we'll take our weapons elsewhere.
NEELIX: Wait! I'll consider your request but first, prove your fortitude.
Drink! SanRoh t'patoh Cha!
CHAKOTAY: I guess my French is a little rusty.
JANEWAY: Don't drink it. It's twice as strong as whisky. I'll be right
back.
EMH: Captain. Is, is it you?
JANEWAY: Yes. We've got to disable the rest of those interfaces.
EMH: The controls are routed through the surgical console in Sickbay, but
it will take time to disable all of them.
JANEWAY: We don't have time. I'll access the Jefferies tube that runs
under that deck plate, set a few charges and blow out the console.
EMH: Charges? The Hirogen have seized the armoury.
JANEWAY: No problem. I've got all the ammo I need right here.
EMH: Holographic explosives?
JANEWAY: With the safety protocols offline, they're as good as the real
thing.
NEELIX: Another of your warriors?
JANEWAY: Yes.
NEELIX: He's a frail looking thing.
JANEWAY: I'll contact you when I've disabled the rest of the interfaces.
In the meantime, stay here.
EMH: With the Klingons?
JANEWAY: Believe me, it's peaceful compared to Sainte Claire. Captain!
NEELIX: Ha!
EMH: Please, don't do that.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

PARIS: They've got us outnumbered.
TORRES: And outgunned. They're setting up a machine gun emplacement
across the street.
TUVOK: Where have you been?
SEVEN: Obtaining supplies.
TUVOK: What is this?
SEVEN: German technology taken from their compound. I can use them to
enhance our weapons.

[Street]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: I've cornered several Voyager crewmen. They've taken
refuge in a guarded building. I need three nucleonic charges to penetrate
the structure.

[Bridge]

ALPHA: Nucleonic charges could damage the holodeck further. Use your hand
weapons.

[Street]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Then I need more hunters.
ALPHA [OC]: They're on the way.

[Jefferies tube]

JANEWAY: Damn, there's a level nine forcefield around the surgical
console. We'll have to go in and shut it down.
CHAKOTAY: Forcefield?
JANEWAY: I'll explain later. Set the detonator for five minutes.

[Sickbay]

HIROGEN MEDIC: Five hunters have been killed in the last hour. You must
engage the safety protocols.
ALPHA [on monitor]: Those protocols aren't functioning.
HIROGEN MEDIC: Then I'll need assistance to. Stand by. You!
JANEWAY: Get him out of here.
CHAKOTAY: There're ten pounds of dynamite under the floor set to blow in
less than three minutes. Move.

[Bridge]

ALPHA: Bridge to Sickbay. Sickbay, respond. Bridge to deck five. Converge
on the Sickbay.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

SEVEN: We are on the holodeck under attack. You must.

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Bridge, this in Holodeck one. I have seized the
building, and I have found another access to this holodeck.

[Ready room]

ALPHA: Seal it. How many captives?

[Le Coeur de Lion]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Four. Their neural interfaces have been disabled. I
will make the kill.
ALPHA [OC]: No.

[Ready room]

ALPHA: They are not prey, they are hostages. I'll need them.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: As you wish. You, help me seal this hatch.
PARIS: What do you think, a boy or a girl?
SEVEN: It's a holographic projection.
TORRES: Unfortunately, it's a very good projection. I feel twenty kilos
heavier. It even kicks.
TUVOK: I don't recognise this programme.
PARIS: I do. He's wearing a Nazi uniform. We're on Earth during the
Second World War.
SEVEN: Nazi?
PARIS: Totalitarian fanatics bent on world conquest. The Borg of their
day. No offence.
SEVEN: None taken.
TORRES: What are you staring at?
NAZI KAPITAN: Get up. You deceived me.
TORRES: Really?
NAZI KAPITAN: I should've seen through your flirtations.
TORRES: If you say so.
NAZI KAPITAN: The thought of you carrying my child disgusts me!
TORRES: You're not the only one.
PARIS: Look, I don't know what went on between the two of you, but it's
obviously over now.
NAZI KAPITAN: I see you're acquainted. Do you find her as attractive as I
once did? I'll miss our nights together.
PARIS: Pig!
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Put the weapon away. Now.
PARIS: Funny, he doesn't seem like your type.

[Holodeck two - Klingon programme]

NEELIX: Doctor, trouble.
EMH: Now what?
NEELIX: The Klingons are starting to wake up from their nap.
EMH: All right, all right, hold on.
NEELIX: What are you doing?
EMH: I've established an interface with Holodeck one. I want to monitor
what's going on over there in case the crew needs my help.
KLINGON: Qapla'!
NEELIX: Uh-oh. What should we do?
EMH: Not having a cure for Klingon hangovers I couldn't tell you.
KLINGON: The battle has begun. Our plan is to penetrate the enemy's
position, cut his forces in half.
NEELIX: And a very good plan it is. Best of luck with it.
KLINGON: You will lead us into battle, Great Warrior.
NEELIX: Maybe I'll just watch from here. Try to offer up some pointers as
things develop.
KLINGON: Sto'Kar! Lead the attack or die here by my hand.
EMH: You heard him. Don't argue with the man, run along! I'll reattach
any severed limbs, just don't misplace them.
KLINGON: You! Cover our flank! Qapla'!
NEELIX: Qapla'.
EMH: Tally-ho.

[Ready room]

ALPHA: Enter. Leave her.
JANEWAY: I see you've done some redecorating.
ALPHA: Your attempt to retake this vessel was inventive. From the day I
seized Voyager you put up a dauntless fight, but your fight is over now.
You're going to help me shut down these simulations and repair the
holodecks.
JANEWAY: No. We'll destroy this ship before we surrender it.
ALPHA: Don't threaten me, Captain. I've faced far more intimidating prey
than you. If this fight continues, I promise you I will hunt down and
kill every member of your crew.
JANEWAY: Well, by then this ship will be damaged beyond repair and there
won't be much of a trophy left, will there?
ALPHA: Perhaps I should kill you and find someone who will co-operate.
JANEWAY: Good luck. You'll get the same response from all of them.
ALPHA: You don't realise what's at stake.
JANEWAY: I know what's at stake. Your sick little game.
ALPHA: This is not a game!
JANEWAY: Then what is it?
ALPHA: I'm trying to create a future for my people.
JANEWAY: Future?
ALPHA: I don't expect you to understand. You are prey.
JANEWAY: You underestimate us.
ALPHA: Yes, perhaps I do.
JANEWAY: I'm listening
ALPHA: My people are hunting themselves into extinction. Your holodeck
technology might offer us an alternative, a new way of life. Instead of
scattering ourselves across the quadrant in pursuit of prey, we could
simulate the hunt and give ourselves a chance to rebuild our civilisation.
JANEWAY: And confine your killing to holograms.
ALPHA: With the safety protocols offline, the pursuit is just as
challenging.
JANEWAY: Oh, I understand what you're trying to do, but then why have you
been torturing us? Why have you thrown my crew into one brutal simulation
after another?
ALPHA: I've been studying your behaviour as I do with all my prey, but
your holodecks allowed me to go further, to explore your culture, your
history. I must admit, I've learned a great deal.
JANEWAY: How so?
ALPHA: Your people have faced extinction many times, but you've always
managed to avoid it. You seem to recognise the need for change.
JANEWAY: Yes. You've got one of those moments running right now on the
holodeck. We called it World War Two.
ALPHA: One of your most difficult eras. And yet you survived.
JANEWAY: It wasn't easy.
ALPHA: You are a resilient species. I admire your cunning.
JANEWAY: Let's end this. I'll call a cease-fire and we can try to contain
the damage. I want my ship back, but in return I will give you what you
need to create the holodeck technology. It would be cunning for you to
agree.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Synthetic, and undrinkable. I am tired of this
simulation.
NAZI KAPITAN: Mein Herr, a word with you.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: And these holograms are becoming annoying as well.
NAZI KAPITAN: What are we waiting for? Why don't we execute these
prisoners?
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Orders. From the Kommandant.
NAZI KAPITAN: If I may speak freely. The Kommandant has been acting
strangely the past few days. He's been questioning German superiority.
Perhaps we shouldn't follow his orders so blindly.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: You will do as he says as long as I tell you to.
NAZI KAPITAN: I don't know how much longer I can stand being trapped in
here.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Perhaps you would enjoy some entertainment. Sing.
SEVEN: I will not.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Sing or you will die.
SEVEN: Then I'll die.
TUVOK: Seven, you are a valued member of this crew. The logical response
would be to grant his request.
SEVEN: Logic is irrelevant. One day the Borg will assimilate your species
despite your arrogance. When that moment arrives, remember me.
ALPHA [OC]: Bridge to Holodeck one.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Yes.

[Bridge]

ALPHA: I've come to an agreement with Captain Janeway. Call a cease-fire.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: What?
TUVOK: Captain?
JANEWAY [OC]: It's true, Tuvok.

[Bridge]

JANEWAY: Our first order of business is to call off the troops. I want
you to find Chakotay

[Le Coeur de Lion]

JANEWAY [OC]: and have him convince his soldiers to pull out of the city.
TUVOK: Aye Captain.
ALPHA [OC]: Turanj

[Bridge]

ALPHA: Order our hunters to end the fighting.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

NAZI KAPITAN: This is madness! We're winning this battle!

[Le Coeur de Lion]

ALPHA [OC]: Our civilisation depends on this agreement.

[Le Coeur de Lion]

HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Acknowledged. You heard him, release the captives.
I'll tell the others. Order all units to withdraw to these positions
NAZI KAPITAN: I have always thought highly of you.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Have you.
NAZI KAPITAN: Yes, but the Kommandant is a fool. He doesn't understand.
He's never embraced the Fuhrer or his vision. One does not co-operate
with decadent forms of life, one hunts them down and eliminates them. The
Kommandant speaks of civilisation. The ancient Romans were civilised. The
Jews are civilised. But in all its moral decay, Rome fell to the spears
of our ancestors as the Jews are falling now. Look at our destiny! The
field of red, the purity of German blood. The blazing white circle of the
sun that sanctified that blood. No one can deny us, no power on Earth or
beyond. Not the Christian Saviour, not the God of the Jews. We are driven
by the very force that gives life to the universe itself! We must
countermand the Kommandant's orders, stay and fight. We must be faithful
to who we are.
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: You two, follow me.

[Sainte Claire - Street]

CHAKOTAY: All units, clear the valley. Return to your previous positions.
We're calling a cease-fire. Repeat, cease fire. Well, the word is out.
TUVOK: Whether it will be acted upon is another question.
CHAKOTAY: Oh, they'll follow orders. I'm their commanding officer,
remember?
PARIS: Keep it moving! Keep it moving! Get the lead out of your pants!
SEVEN: Mid-twentieth century American slang.
PARIS: You got a problem with that, sister?
SEVEN: You're enjoying this simulation. I find that peculiar, given the
circumstances.
PARIS: Loosen up, baby doll, the war's almost over.
TORRES: So much for the cease-fire!
NAZI KAPITAN: Fire! Fire!

[Holodeck two - Klingon programme]

EMH: I've been monitoring the other simulation, and the fighting's
getting worse. The crew is taking heavy casualties.
NEELIX: How can we help?
EMH: I'll transfer my programme to Holodeck one. You take the Jefferies
tube and meet me there.
NEELIX: There's only the two of us.
EMH: Nevertheless we have to try and... even half drunk, Klingons are
among the best warriors in the galaxy.
NEELIX: But they're already in the middle of a war with the house of
whatever it is.
EMH: Then you'll just have to convince them that there's a more important
battle to be waged.
NEELIX: Me?
EMH: You are their Great Warrior. Lead them!
NEELIX: Pardon me, gentlemen. I wonder if I might have a word with you.
EMH: They're Klingons, not kittens!
NEELIX: You will listen!

[Holodeck lab]

JANEWAY: These sensors indicate you've placed holo-emitters on decks five
through twelve? No wonder the system breached, you've turned Voyager into
one big Holodeck!
ALPHA: Can you shut it down?
JANEWAY: Yes, but I'm going to have to initiate an overload. We'll worry
about making repairs later. Right now we've got to put an end to those
simulations. Janeway to Ensign Kim.

[Bridge]

KIM: Yes, Captain.
JANEWAY [OC]: Harry, I'm going to need your help overloading the
holo-emitter network.

[Holodeck lab]

JANEWAY: I'm transferring optical processor control to you now. Start
charging the secondary power relays.

[Bridge]

JANEWAY [OC]: We'll use them to trigger the overload.
KIM: I'm on it.

[Holodeck lab]

JANEWAY: It's going to take some time. There are over eight hundred
emitters that we have to
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Move away from the controls!
ALPHA: Why haven't you ordered the cease-fire?
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: Move away from the controls.
ALPHA: Listen to me!
HIROGEN SS OFFICER: No!
JANEWAY: What are you waiting for?
HIROGEN: I am a hunter. You are my prey. Run.

[Sainte Claire - Street]

SEVEN: I'm modifying this explosive device to emit a photonic burst.
It'll be harmless to organic tissue but it should disrupt all holographic
activity within twenty metres.

[Bridge]

[Sainte Claire - Street]

CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Our holographic allies are losing ground. The
German troops are surrounding the city.
PARIS: I don't know how much longer we can hold them off. These weapons
are pretty crude. They're not much help.
TORRES: Maybe we should fall back?
CHAKOTAY: Where to? They're coming in from all sides. Tuvok, any chance
we can get through that breach in the hologrid.
TUVOK: Unlikely. Twenty more Hirogen have taken up position near the
opening. We are outnumbered.
CHAKOTAY: How's it going?
SEVEN: I'm modifying this explosive device to emit a photonic burst. It
will be harmless to organic tissue but it should disrupt all holographic
activity within twenty metres.
CHAKOTAY: We'll try to buy you some time.

[Bridge]

ALPHA: I'll be in Sickbay.

[Sainte Claire - Street]

CHAKOTAY: They're closing in. Seven!
NAZI KAPITAN: Surrender. Verdamt! Bring that one to me! I will spare your
life for now, but only because you are carrying a German child.

[Corridor]

JANEWAY: Please don't do this. I can be of use to you. I can help you
repair the ship. Don't kill me!

[Sainte Claire - Street]

NAZI KAPITAN: Against the wall. Your deaths will serve the glory of the
Reich. Prepare to fire.
NEELIX: Fight on, warriors! This way!
EMH: Qapla', gentlemen! Qapla'!

[Corridor]

JANEWAY: This hunt is over. Tell your hunters to stand down. I'll use
this if you force me to.

[Sainte Claire - Street]

CHAKOTAY: It's over. Let's go.

Captain's log, Stardate 51715.2. The damage to Voyager has been extreme.
Both sides have taken heavy casualties and it's clear that no one is
going to win this conflict. The fighting has reached a standstill and the
remaining Hirogen have agreed to negotiate a truce.

[Cargo Bay two]

YOUNG HIROGEN: What is this?
JANEWAY: An optronic datacore. You can use it to create holodeck
technology on your own vessels. I made a promise with your leader, before
he died, that I would give this knowledge to the Hirogen. Take it.
YOUNG HIROGEN: His ideas were unconventional. I do not share them.
JANEWAY: Was he any more unconventional than you are? Calling a
cease-fire with your prey? Only a few days ago the thought of speaking
with us on equal terms would've been inconceivable, but here we are.
Accept this trophy. You can use it to create a new future for your
people. At the very least, you can hang it on your bulkhead.
