	FADE IN:

	RECAP of Season Five finale "Call to Arms."

1    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	CLOSE ON the Defiant moving slowly through space. PULL 
	BACK to REVEAL two more FEDERATION STARSHIPS, one of 
	which is leaking plasma. PULL BACK even further to see 
	several more SHIPS, including the Bird of Prey 
	Rotarran, all looking battered and much the worse for 
	wear. A couple of the ships are being towed, unable 
	to proceed under their own power.

	PULL BACK EVEN MORE to see the remainder of the Second 
	Fleet. The once-proud and powerful armada that the 
	Defiant and the Rotarran joined at the end of "Call to 
	Arms" has been reduced by the ravages of war to a 
	third of its original size.

2    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	SISKO, O'BRIEN, DAX and NOG are at their stations; the 
	rest of the bridge crew is made up of SUPERNUMERARIES. 
	Everyone looks gaunt and grim from three months of 
	relentless fighting. Only Sisko seems immune to the 
	air of defeat that permeates the ship and its crew. 
	He sits in the Captain's Chair, contained, in 
	control -- ready to go another fifteen rounds with the 
	dogs of war.

					SISKO
				(to Nog) 
			Cadet.

					NOG 
			Long range scanners show no sign 
			of Jem'Hadar ships. Looks like 
			they've broken off their pursuit.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      2.

2    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			I guess they got tired of looking 
			at our backs.
				(tired and bitter) 
			Three months of bloody slaughter 
			and what do we have to show for 
			it? Not a damn thing. Engage and 
			retreat. Engage and retreat. 
			Just one time I would've liked to 
			have seen their backs --

					SISKO
			That's enough, Chief.

					O'BRIEN
				(still stewing) 
			Sorry, sir. Nothing a little 
			sleep won't cure.

					DAX
			We could all use some sleep. 
			What's it been, seventy-eight 
			hours?

					NOG 
			Shouldn't we have heard something 
			from the Seventh Fleet by now?

					DAX
			I wouldn't worry just yet. The 
			Tyra System is far enough away 
			that it's going to take a day or 
			two for any message to reach us.

					NOG 
			You think they can stop the 
			Dominion?

					O'BRIEN
			You're damn right they can.
				(a beat) 
			Somebody has to.

	And as they all share that hope --

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      3.

3    INT. DEFIANT - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM

	GARAK, sporting a huge, nasty bruise on his forehead, 
	is waiting in the room full of medical supplies. 
	BASHIR ENTERS, looking tired and spent.

					GARAK 
			Ah, there you are. I'd just about 
			given up hope, doctor. I would 
			think that all those lunches we've 
			shared would've entitled me to 
			preferential treatment.

					BASHIR 
			Garak, I've got twelve wounded 
			officers and crewmen out there --
			each one in a lot worse shape than 
			you.

					GARAK 
			If you're trying to cheer me up, 
			it's working. I feel better 
			already.

	Bashir examines Garak's wound and begins to work on it.

					BASHIR 
			What happened?

					GARAK 
			I was studying some star charts 
			for Captain Sisko during the last 
			assault when I had a sudden and 
			somewhat violent encounter with 
			a bulkhead.

					BASHIR 
			You'll live.

					GARAK 
			I wish I shared your confidence. 
				(off his look)
			Oh, I'm sure my head will heal, 
			but the way this war is going... 
			I wouldn't bet on any of us living 
			to a ripe, old age.

					BASHIR 
			I admit the odds aren't good. But 
			they could be worse.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      4.

3    CONTINUED:

					GARAK 
			Let me guess, you've used that 
			genetically enhanced brain of 
			yours to calculate our chances of 
			survival.

					BASHIR 
			It really wasn't that difficult. 
			I simply began with a binomial 
			risk distribution --

					GARAK
				(cutting him off) 
			I'm really not interested, Doctor. 
			Ever since it became public 
			knowledge that you were 
			genetically engineered, you've 
			used every opportunity to show off.

					BASHIR 
			I have nothing to hide anymore. 
			I might as well use what I have.

	After a silent beat, Garak's curiosity gets the better 
	of him.

					GARAK 
			Well what are our chances? Over 
			fifty percent?

					BASHIR 
			Thirty-two point seven.

					GARAK 
			I'm sorry I asked.
				(a beat) 
			You're sure about that figure?

					BASHIR 
			Do you want me to take you through 
			the entire set of calculations?

					GARAK 
			Not really.
				(a beat) 
			Genetically engineered, indeed.

					BASHIR 
			Excuse me?

 DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER     4A.

3    CONTINUED: (2)

					GARAK 
			Look at you. You act like you 
			haven't a care in the world. It's 
			that kind of smug, superior 
			attitude that makes people like 
			you so unpopular.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      5.

3    CONTINUED: (3)

					BASHIR
			Are you insulting me?

					GARAK 
			A thirty-two point seven percent 
			chance of survival... I call that 
			insulting.

					BASHIR 
			Don't take it so personally. It's 
			strictly a matter of mathematics.

					GARAK 
			It's strictly a matter or our 
			lives!
				(a beat) 
			You're not genetically engineered, 
			you're a Vulcan.

					BASHIR 
			If I'm a Vulcan, how do you 
			explain my boyish smile?

					GARAK 
			Not so boyish anymore.

4    INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL

	CLOSE ON a hand as it reaches into a replicator and 
	takes out a cup of steaming raktajino. TILT UP to 
	REVEAL Sisko, who moves over to join Dax at a table.

					DAX 
			So where do you think Starfleet's 
			going to send us next?

					SISKO
			I don't know. But if I have any 
			say in the matter, we'll be going 
			right back to the front lines.

	Then an offscreen voice catches their attention

					MARTOK (O.S.) 
			Well said, Captain.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      6.

5    NEW ANGLE

	to include WORF and MARTOK, ENTERING. Martok holds his 
	arm, covering a wound made by a Jem'Hadar weapon.

					MARTOK
			And my ship will be at your side.

	Dax leaps up and runs over to Worf.

					DAX
			Worf!

	She encircles him in a huge bear hug.

					MARTOK
				(to Worf)
			Tell her.

					DAX
				(suddenly concerned)
			Tell me what?

					WORF
			It can wait.

					MARTOK
			No, it cannot.

	Martok crosses over to the replicator.

					MARTOK
			Raktajino.
				(to Dax)
			It has been weighing heavily on
			his mind.

					DAX
			What is it, Worf? What's wrong?

					WORF
			It's about our wedding.

					DAX
				(concerned)
			You're getting cold feet --

	Worf shakes that thought off.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER     6A.

5    CONTINUED:

					WORF
			You have scheduled the ritual 
			sacrifice of the tar'g to occur 
			after the wedding feast has been 
			served.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      7.

5    CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX
				(surprised) 
			We haven't seen each other in five 
			weeks and that's the first thing 
			you say to me?

					WORF
				(adamant) 
			We agreed it would be a 
			traditional ceremony.

					DAX
				(backing off) 
			Have it your way. First we'll 
			shed blood, then we'll feast.

					WORF
			As it should be.

					MARTOK
				(to Dax) 
			He has been unable to talk about 
			anything else for days.

					DAX
				(to Sisko; re: Worf) 
			He's such a worrier.

	Sisko smiles, he's an understanding friend.

					SISKO
			Take my advice, old man. A small 
			wedding is the way to go.

					DAX
				(playful) 
			You get married the way you want, 
			and I'll get married the way I 
			want.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      8.

5    CONTINUED: (3)

	Dax takes hold of Worf's arm and looks to Sisko.

					DAX 
			I'll see you later, Benjamin?

	Sisko understands; they have a lot to catch up on.

					SISKO
			Try not to break any bones.

	Dax smiles and leads Worf out the door.

					MARTOK 
			Now that that's settled, I'd 
			better go take care of this.
				(re: his wound) 
			Klingons make great warriors, but 
			terrible doctors.

	Martok turns to leave just as a shaken Bashir ENTERS 
	and approaches Sisko.

					BASHIR 
			Captain...

					MARTOK
			Just the man I wanted to see.

	But Bashir has something important to tell Sisko.

					BASHIR 
			We've been ordered to report to 
			Starbase Three-Seven-Five for 
			reassignment.

	Sisko nods, then notices Bashir solemn mood.

					SISKO
			Something else, Doctor?

					BASHIR
			There's news of the Seventh
			Fleet...

					SISKO
				(bracing himself for the 
				news) 
			Go on.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER     8A.

5    CONTINUED:	(4)

					BASHIR
			Only fourteen ships made it back 
			to our lines.

					MARTOK
				(grim) 
			Fourteen out of a hundred and 
			twelve...

					BASHIR
				(showing his anger) 
			Sir, we can't keep taking those 
			kinds of losses -- not if we expect 
			to win this --

					SISKO
				(maintaining his
				composure)
			Thank you, doctor. That'll be all.

					BASHIR 
			I'd better take a look at that arm.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - TEASER      9.

5    CONTINUED:	(5)

	Bashir collects himself, and after nodding 
	acknowledgment, EXITS, leaves Sisko to his thoughts.

6    NEW ANGLE ON SISKO

	alone in the Mess Hall. He looks down at the mug of 
	raktajino in his hand, and then lets loose his rage, 
	slamming the cup down and shattering the glass 
	tabletop.

	After a beat, Sisko takes a deep breath, and wills back 
	his composure, refusing to give in to defeat. And on 
	his look of utter defiance, we:

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

7    EXT. SPACE - TEROK NOR (OPTICAL)

	The station is a hub of activity. Dominion ships come 
	and go at will.

					DUKAT (V.O.) 
			Permanent Documentation File, 
			Dukat, S.G. The war continues to 
			go well. Each day brings reports 
			of new victories.

8    INT. OPS

	as a confident DUKAT steps out of his office and gazes 
	over Ops, which is now manned by Cardassian and 
	Jem'Hadar troops. Dukat looks satisfied and well-
	rested -- the proverbial cat that swallowed the canary.

					DUKAT (V.O.) 
			It's only a matter of time before 
			the Federation collapses and Earth 
			becomes another conquered planet 
			under Dominion rule.

	Dukat ambles down the stairs, nodding encouragement to 
	his troops. The Cardassians look upon him with awe, 
	while the Jem'Hadar remain poker-faced.

					DUKAT (V.O.) 
			All in all, it's a good time for 
			Cardassia and the Dominion.

	DAMAR, Dukat's adjutant, approaches him and together 
	they EXIT.

9    INT. TEROK NOR - WARDROOM

	The door OPENS and Dukat and Damar ENTER to find WEYOUN 
	and KIRA in mid-conversation. Kira plays her cards 
	close to the vest; Weyoun is chock-full of his cloying 
	sincerity.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    11.

9    CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN 
			My dear Major Kira, you have no 
			idea how it pleases me to hear you 
			say that.

	Weyoun, aware of Dukat's arrival, turns to greet him.

					WEYOUN 
			Dukat, the major has just given 
			me the most wonderful news. 
			Bajorans are returning to the 
			station.

					DUKAT 
			I'm well aware of it.

					WEYOUN 
			Then I'm sure you share my delight 
			in knowing that life here is 
			returning to normal. The shops 
			are reopening, the Promenade is 
			abuzz with activity once again, 
			and the Habitat Ring echoes with 
			the laughter of happy children.

					DAMAR
				(to Dukat, don't worry) 
			I've doubled security patrols 
			throughout the station.

	Weyoun notices that Damar's comment doesn't go down 
	very well with Kira.

					WEYOUN
				(to Dukat) 
			Are such precautions really 
			necessary?

					DUKAT 
			I've found that one can't be too 
			careful when dealing with Bajorans.

					KIRA
			What's wrong, Dukat? Afraid we'll 
			take the station away from you 
			again?

					DAMAR 
			You're welcome to try.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    12.

9    CONTINUED: (2)

	Weyoun steps in before things can get too ugly.

					WEYOUN 
			Come now, there's no need for this 
			petty bickering. We're all 
			friends here.

					KIRA
			Are we?

					WEYOUN 
			Of course, we are. And if you 
			have a suggestion, major, feel 
			free to bring it to me at any time.

					KIRA
			Fine. We'd like the station's 
			Bajoran security force reinstated.

					DAMAR
				(sarcastic) 
			I suppose you want us to give them 
			back their weapons, as well.

					KIRA
			That's right.

					DUKAT 
			The station no longer requires a 
			Bajoran security force. Our 
			troops can handle any trouble that 
			arises.

					KIRA
				(to Weyoun) 
			The Federation and Bajor always 
			shared equal responsibility for 
			station security. I thought you 
			said we'd have the same 
			arrangement with the Dominion.
				(pointed) 
			After all, we're all friends here. 
			Aren't we?

					WEYOUN
				(to Dukat; firm) 
			Perhaps you should reconsider your 
			decision.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    13.

9    CONTINUED: (3)

					DUKAT 
			The order stands. You may trust 
			the Bajorans, but I don't. And 
			until they earn my trust, I prefer 
			to keep them unarmed. 
				(to Kira) 
			And if you were in my position, 
			major, you'd do the same thing.

	Weyoun leads Kira to the door.

					WEYOUN 
			Perhaps it would be best to let 
			the matter rest for a while. I'm 
			sure, in time, all these minor 
			problems will be resolved to our 
			mutual satisfaction.

					KIRA
			I'll remember you said that.

					WEYOUN 
			I'm sure you will.

	Kira is about to leave, but Weyoun stops her.

					WEYOUN 
			One last thing... Odo.

					KIRA
			What about him?

					WEYOUN 
			Is he aware that I'm doing all I 
			can to strengthen the bond between 
			the Dominion and the Bajoran 
			people?

	Kira doesn't quite know how to respond to the question.

					KIRA 
			Why don't you ask him yourself?

					WEYOUN 
			No, no. I wouldn't want to bother 
			him. Good day, major.

	Kira, who has certainly had enough of Weyoun, EXITS.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    14.

10   NEW ANGLE

	as Dukat steps up to Weyoun.

					DUKAT 
			Fascinating woman, isn't she?

					WEYOUN
			I wouldn't know. But I do know 
			we need her as an ally.

					DAMAR
				(hard) 
			The Bajorans will never be our 
			allies.

					WEYOUN
				(to Damar, pointing to 
				the door) 
			Out.

	Damar looks to Dukat.

					WEYOUN 
			Don't look at him. I'm telling 
			you to leave. Now.

	Dukat nods to Damar, who EXITS immediately. Before 
	Weyoun can complain about Damar, Dukat offers a 
	preemptive comment:

					DUKAT
			I find him useful.

					WEYOUN 
			In the future, it might be prudent 
			to include me in all decisions 
			relating to station policy. Now, 
			what about the wormhole? You 
			assured me that you could 
			dismantle the minefield within a 
			month. That was two months ago.

					DUKAT 
			I admit work is proceeding more 
			slowly than expected. But these 
			aren't ordinary mines -- every 
			time we destroy or deactivate one 
			of them, its neighbor replicates 
			a new one.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    15.

10   CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN 
				(musing) 
			Self-replicating mines. I'd like 
			to meet the Federation engineer 
			who came up with that.

					DUKAT 
			I'd like to get my hands around 
			his neck.

					WEYOUN
			We have to take down that 
			minefield and reopen the wormhole.

					DUKAT 
			And we will. But there's no need 
			for panic. We're winning the war.

					WEYOUN
			For the moment, yes. But to 
			defeat the Federation, we're going 
			to need reinforcements and new

				(a beat) 
			Soon.

					DUKAT 
			I said I'd deal with the minefield 
			and I will.

	Weyoun smiles as if sealing an agreement, but then the 
	smile disappears, and turning his back on Dukat, he 
	EXITS. We hold for a beat on a thoughtful Dukat.

11   INT. TEROK NOR - QUARK'S

	The bar is fairly busy. It's somewhat disturbing to 
	see Cardassian soldiers in Quark's drinking and playing 
	the various games of chance. But what's even more 
	disturbing is the presence of Jem'Hadar soldiers, who 
	neither drink nor eat, but simply observe the activity 
	around them. There are a few scattered Bajorans, but 
	they tend to hang together, away from the others.

	QUARK approaches a table of Jem'Hadar soldiers.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE   15A.

11   CONTINUED:

					QUARK 
			Good evening, gentlemen. Once 
			again, I see you're at your "usual 
			table." It's amazing how many of 
			my customers think of Quark's as 
			their second home.

	Quark stops his spiel to await some response from the 
	soldiers. But the soldiers just stare at him poker-faced.

					QUARK 
			I only wish I had a holo-imager 
			so I could preserve this warm and 
			wonderful moment of camaraderie. 
			Something you could hang up on the 
			wall of your barracks.

	Still nothing from the soldiers.

					QUARK 
			Have you tried the dabo tables? 
			I'm sure one of my lovely 
			hostesses would be happy to teach 
			you the game.

	Still nothing.

					QUARK 
			I know. A complimentary hour in one 
			of our state-of-the-art holosuites? 
			Whatever your desires, I'm sure we 
			can satisfy them.

	But the soldiers haven't moved a muscle.

					QUARK 
			Perhaps some other time. Enjoy 
			the evening.

	Quark graciously moves away. Once his back is turned 
	toward the soldiers, he mutters to himself:

					QUARK 
			Tough crowd.

11A  NEW ANGLE

	Kira and ODO are seated at the bar doing a postmortem 
	on Kira's meeting with Weyoun and Dukat.

          DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97         16.

11A  CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			I'm telling you, Odo, Dukat has 
			only one thing on his mind, and 
			that's revenge. He can't stand 
			the thought that Bajor defeated 
			Cardassia.

					ODO
			You think he wants to reopen the 
			labor camps?

					KIRA
			Eventually.

					ODO 
			Then I suppose we should be 
			grateful he has Weyoun looking 
			over his shoulder.

					KIRA
			Maybe. Weyoun's a hard one to 
			figure out. I don't really trust 
			him... but I do trust him more 
			than Dukat.

					ODO
			Weyoun knows that it's in the 
			Dominion's best interest to honor 
			its treaty with Bajor. They want 
			to prove to the rest of the Alpha 
			Quadrant they're true to their 
			word.

	Kira nods agreement as Odo looks at him thoughtfully.

					KIRA
			Weyoun asked me about you. He
			seemed very concerned about what
			you thought of him.

					ODO
			I try not to think of him.

					KIRA
			He'd be hurt to hear you said that.
				(a beat)
			I'll have to mention it to him.

	They share a smile; a moment of warmth between the two 
	friends.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    17.

11A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO 
			I'm glad you can still smile.

					KIRA
			Only when I'm with you.

					ODO
			That's kind of you to say.

					KIRA 
			It's true. When I talk to you, 
			things don't seem as bad...
				(a beat) 
			Though every time I think of Dukat 
			sitting in the captain's office...
				(anger rising) 
			Or the fact that the Federation 
			seems to be losing this war and 
			we're here doing nothing...

	Odo places a reassuring hand on Kira's shoulder.

					ODO 
			I share your frustration, major. 
			But right now, there's really 
			nothing we can do except bide our 
			time. It's like Captain Sisko 
			said, Bajor must be kept out of 
			the fighting.

					KIRA
				(with a smile) 
			And who am I to argue with the 
			Emissary.

12   NEW ANGLE

	Quark approaches, carrying a tall drink which he places 
	in front of Kira.

					QUARK 
			Thanks for waiting.
				(pleased) 
			Things have been a little busier 
			than expected.
				(re: the drink)
			This one's on the house.

 DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT ONE    18.

12   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(suspicious)
			What do you want, Quark?

					QUARK 
			The usual -- peace, love, 
			understanding -- not to mention 
			a generous profit margin, which 
			I'm happy to say is looking more 
			and more likely.
				(looking around the room) 
			You know, I never expected to say 
			this, but as occupations go --
			this one's not so bad.

					KIRA
			I suppose that's true if all 
			you're worried about is your 
			monthly balance sheet.

					QUARK
			I'm not just concerned about
			profit, major. Look around -- do
			you see any ghetto fences dividing
			the Promenade? Or exhausted
			Bajoran slave laborers, sprawled
			on the ground after a grueling day
			in the Ore Processing Center?  Do
			you hear the cries of starving
			children? I don't. Now don't get
			me wrong, I miss the Federation,
			too. All I'm saying is things
			could be a lot worse.

	Quark goes to attend to other customers, leaving Kira 
	with that thought.

					ODO 
			I hate to say it, but he's right. 
			The Dominion seems determined to 
			show it can be a friend to Bajor.

					KIRA
			If it's such a good friend, then 
			how come there are no Bajoran 
			security officers on the station?

	shows signs of the burden of office.

					ROSS 
			I'm glad to see you made it back

					SISKO
			I was lucky. We lost a lot of

					ROSS
			Yes, we did. And we're going to

	Sisko and Ross nod silently, the weight of that truth

					ROSS 
			I hope you'll find this office 
			satisfactory.

	Sisko's not quite sure what the Admiral is getting at.

					SISKO 
			I wasn't aware I'd be needing an

			I'm afraid you're going to be here

	A baffled Dax paces the room as Sisko watches.

					DAX
			Relieved of command? Why?

					SISKO 
			Admiral Ross didn't say. All he 
			said was that we'd get our new

					DAX
			At least the crew's staying

				(a beat) 
			We are staying together, aren't we?

					SISKO
			Count on it.

	Dax sighs with relief, that's good news at least.

					DAX 
			So what do you plan on doing for 
			the next couple of hours?

					SISKO
			I hadn't given it much thought.

					DAX
			Maybe this would be a good time 
			to contact your father.

	Sisko doesn't exactly leap at the idea.

					SISKO 
			Maybe.

					DAX
			You haven't spoken to him for

					JOSEPH 
			You mean you didn't leave my

					SISKO
			Well, no... I did.

					JOSEPH 
			Then it certainly is as bad as it

					SISKO
			Look, Dad, it wasn't my decision. 
			It was Jake's choice to stay

					JOSEPH 
			Oh, so now you're going to blame

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT TWO    22.

16   CONTINUED:

					JOSEPH 
			I don't care who's responsible. 
			It's wrong and I want him back.

					SISKO
				(simply) 
			So do I.

	A long beat of silence as they both deal with that 
	thought.

					JOSEPH
				(soft) 
			You think he's all right?

					SISKO
			I hope so.
				(a beat) 
			I'll get him back, Dad. I promise.

					JOSEPH 
			When?

					SISKO
			I don't know. It might be a

					JOSEPH 
			Tell them you want to go get your

					SISKO
			It's wartime. It's not up to me. 
			I go where I'm sent.

	Sisko looks for a way to change the subject.

	Joseph doesn't want to change the subject.

					JOSEPH 
			Are things really as bad as the

					SISKO
			Maybe worse.

					JOSEPH 
			You certainly know how to comfort

					SISKO
			You didn't raise me to be a liar.

					JOSEPH 
			I raised you to be a chef, for all

					SISKO
			It's true.

					JOSEPH 
			Well if that's the case, you'd

			enough room to allow people to 
			leave each other alone.

					SISKO
			It just doesn't work that way. 
			It should. But it doesn't.

	For a beat, both men are lost in thoughts of a kinder,

	Weyoun turns to see JAKE SISKO approach, PADD in hand. 
	The Jem'Hadar move to intercede, but Weyoun holds up

					WEYOUN 
			Please, I prefer just "Weyoun."

					JAKE
				(that's good) 
			That's the kind of detail people

					WEYOUN
			For what?

					JAKE 
			For the interview we talked about. You

					WEYOUN 
			I'm afraid that's impossible.

	Weyoun continues to walk, Jake falls into step with him.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT TWO    25.

17   CONTINUED:

					JAKE 
			Why?

					WEYOUN
			Because I've read your previous 
			articles and they left me with one 
			inescapable conclusion: you are 
			biased against the Dominion.

					JAKE 
			What gave you that idea?

					WEYOUN
			You keep referring to us as the 
			station's, quote, occupying 
			force, unquote.

					JAKE 
			What's wrong with that?

					WEYOUN
			It has negative connotations. All 
			your articles are filled with 
			pejorative terminology -- which 
			is why I've been forced to 
			withhold their transmission.

					JAKE 
			Are you saying no one in the 
			Federation has read my reports?

					WEYOUN
			If I don't send them, they can't 
			read them.

					JAKE 
			But what about freedom of the press?

	Weyoun stops walking and turns to face Jake. He looks 
	at Jake for a beat -- is he joking?

					WEYOUN 
			Please tell me you're not that 
			naive.

					JAKE 
			But I only stayed here so I could 
			report on the occupation.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT TWO    26.

17   CONTINUED: (2)

	Weyoun takes immediate offense at the word "occupation."

					WEYOUN 
			You see, there you go again. This 
			isn't an occupation. This is a 
			Cardassian station. I'm sure 
			you're aware that there are no 
			Dominion troops on Bajor. And why
			should there be? We have a treaty 
			with them. They're our friends.

					JAKE 
			All right. I'm sorry. I didn't 
			mean anything by it.

					WEYOUN
			If you want me to send your 
			articles to the Federation, you're 
			going to have to provide a more 
			balanced perspective.

					JAKE 
			I won't write Dominion propaganda.

					WEYOUN
			I would never dream of asking you 
			to. All I want is for you to keep 
			an open mind.

					JAKE 
				(a beat) 
			Okay, my mind's open.  Now can we
			do the interview?

					WEYOUN 
			All in good time. You keep

			Let's leave it at that for now. 
			Good day.

	And with that, Weyoun walks off leaving Jake to

			I don't have time for this.

	Kira turns to go, but Dukat stops her with an order:

					DUKAT 
			Major!

	Kira turns to face the Cardassian.

						DUKAT
				(softening) 
			I haven't dismissed you yet.

					KIRA 
			What do you want from me, Dukat?

					DUKAT 
			Come now, major. Have the last 
			three months been that bad?

					KIRA
			Is that why I'm here? To flatter 
			you? Let you know what a good job 
			you're doing and how happy we all

	Dukat moves closer to Kira.

					DUKAT 
			Sarcasm doesn't become you, major. 
			It's your directness that I've 
			always found appealing.

					KIRA
			Dukat, I've got better things to

			play out one of your little

	Kira tries to move around Dukat, but he blocks her way 
	by placing one arm against the wall, boxing her in.

					DUKAT
			You feel I've betrayed you.

					DUKAT 
			Cardassia was on the edge of an 
			abyss, major. The war with the 
			Klingons turned us into a 
			third-rate power. My people had 
			lost their way. I've made them 
			strong again.

					KIRA
			At what price? You've sold

					DUKAT 
			A high price, to be sure. But 
			look what we're getting in 
			return -- the Alpha Quadrant 
			itself.

					KIRA
			We'll see about that.

					DUKAT 
			Yes, we will.

	Dukat offers his most ingratiating smile.

					DUKAT
			I could make things very pleasant 
			for you here, Kira.

					KIRA
			You could start by doing something 
			about your breath.

	Dukat gives a bemused LAUGH.

					DUKAT 
			I'm a patient man. I can wait.

	Kira explodes at Dukat's attitude.

					DUKAT 
			We already do.

	Dukat reaches over to stroke Kira's face with the back 
	of his hand. It's a disturbingly intimate gesture. 
	Kira slaps his hand away, staring at him with intense 
	hatred. Dukat responds with a hearty LAUGH, sauntering 
	back to his desk.

					BASHIR
			There. I wish I had had more time

					SISKO
			Well, at least we know one side

					BASHIR
			The headsets were designed to be 
			worn by Vorta and Jem'Hadar -- not 
			by humans.

	Garak steps forward.

					GARAK 
			Captain, may I make a suggestion?

						SISKO
			Only if you talk softly.

					GARAK 
			We saw Dukat wearing one of those 
			headsets during the attack on Deep 
			Space Nine. Perhaps Cardassian 
			physiology is more compatible.

					SISKO
			Are you volunteering?

					GARAK
			I suppose I am. The ship carries 
			two of them. If I wear one, you 
			won't have to -- at least not all 
			the time.

					BASHIR
			I agree with Garak, captain. The 
			less you wear it, the better.

	Sisko picks up the other headset and hands it to Garak.

					SISKO
			Mister Garak.

	Garak puts on the second headset and immediately reacts 
	to the images being projected into his retina.

			Don't tell me, tell them.

	And ANOTHER.

					O'BRIEN
				(reluctantly) 
			Yes, sir.

					DAX
			The Centaur's followed us out of warp.

	ANOTHER HIT SHAKES the ship.

	Sisko's Jem'Hadar ship makes a sharp turn to come in

	of heading back towards us like it did before, the

				(pacing) 
			The war isn't over yet but as far 
			as Dukat's concerned -- he's 
			already won. I'd love to show him 
			he's wrong.

					ODO
			I'm afraid -- for the time being 
			at least -- he has won. Look at 
			me -- I don't know why I bother 
			to sit here every day. I don't 
			even have a security force to 
			patrol the Promenade.

	This stops Kira in her tracks.

					KIRA 
			Then ask for one. Demand that 
			they reinstate your Bajoran 
			deputies.

					ODO
			Dukat will never agree to that.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT FOUR    44.

46   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			Forget Dukat. Go to Weyoun. 
			He'll listen to you. In his eyes 
			you're a god -- that gives you 
			power.

	Odo looks at her intently.

					KIRA
				(pressing her advantage) 
			But what good is having power 
			unless you're willing to use it?

	As Odo contemplates her words --

46A  INT. TEROK NOR - WARDROOM

	CLOSE ON a hand reaching into a metal case and taking 
	out a pair of vials containing ketracel-white.

					JEM'HADAR SOLDIER (O.S.) 
			We pledge our loyalty to the

	PULL BACK to REVEAL Weyoun holding the vials. He hands 
	them over to two Jem'Hadar soldiers.

					WEYOUN 
			Then receive this reward from the 
			Founders. May it keep you strong.

	The Jem'Hadar immediately attach the white to their 
	feed lines. It gives them a visible and immediate 
	boost. They EXIT.

46B  ANOTHER ANGLE

	to include Dukat who has been watching the procedure.

					DUKAT 
			You enjoy that, don't you? That 
			constant reminder that you're 
			their master.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT FOUR   45A.

46B  CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN 
			The Founders are the masters. I 
			am merely their servant, as are 
			the Jem'Hadar.
				(pointed) 
			And you.

					DUKAT 
			That may be. But even amongst 
			servants, someone has to be in 
			charge.

					WEYOUN 
			That's exactly the kind of 
			observation I've come to expect 
			from you, Dukat. Interesting, 
			yet somewhat... petty.

	Before Dukat can respond, we hear the sound of the door 
	OPENING --

46C  ANGLE ON THE DOOR

	as Damar ENTERS, leading Odo.

					DAMAR 
			Forgive the interruption.
				(to Weyoun; re: Odo) 
			But he insisted on seeing you 
			immediately.

	Weyoun's eyes light up at the sight of the changeling. 
	He approaches Odo, arms outstretched, almost as if to 
	embrace the Founder.

					WEYOUN 
			Founder, I'm honored by your 
			visit. Is there someway I can be 
			of service?

					ODO
			I want my Bajoran security 
			officers reinstated.

					WEYOUN
				(bowing his head 
				reverentially) 
			Consider it done.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT FOUR   45B.

46C  CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			From now on, they'll be 
			responsible for security on the 
			Promenade.

					WEYOUN 
			I don't see any problem with that.

	Odo is surprised at how quickly Weyoun has agreed to 
	his demand. Dukat and Damar are also surprised, and 
	they share a look of anger.

					DUKAT 
			I do.

	But Weyoun shoots Dukat a hard look as he holds up a 
	silencing hand.

					WEYOUN 
				(hard) 
			This is between me and Odo. 
				(softer) 
			I'll thank you to keep out of it.

	Weyoun smiles at Odo. Odo nods agreement with Weyoun, 
	then turns to Damar.

					ODO 
			I'll have my officers report to 
			the armory within the hour.

	Damar looks to Dukat, who bites his tongue and 
	reluctantly nods his approval. As Odo turns to leave, 
	Weyoun speaks up --

					WEYOUN 
			Now that I've done something for 
			you, perhaps there's something 
			you'd consent to do for me...

	And on Odo's puzzled expression --

46D  INT. QUARK'S

	Close on Kira, who is looking at Odo with disbelief.

					KIRA
			A member of the station's Ruling 
			Council? You?

46D  CONTINUED:

					ODO
				(nodding) 
			Along with Weyoun and Dukat. Now 
			I'll have a voice in station 
			policy.

					KIRA 
			Are you sure this is a good idea?

					ODO
			Dukat thought it was a terrible 
			idea. You should have seen his 
			face when Weyoun offered me the 
			position.

					KIRA 
			Don't you see Weyoun's using you? 
			Your presence on the Council 
			validates the Dominion's control 
			of the station.

	But Odo has been thinking about his situation and tries 
	to reassure his friend.

					ODO 
			I thought we were using him.
				(a beat) 
			I know the dangers, Major. I've 
			had to walk this line before -- 
			during the Cardassian occupation.
				(a beat) 
			I can do it again. But, this time 
			I won't be alone -- I'll have you 
			to help me.

	Kira looks at Odo, smiles and pats his hand.

					KIRA
			That's right, you will.

	Odo smiles back at his friend.

					ODO 
			Then this is a victory after all.

					KIRA 
			I suppose it is... but for some 
			reason, it doesn't feel like one.

	And on that note ---

					O'BRIEN
			See, cadet? There was nothing to 
			worry about --

	Suddenly the SHIP ROCKS VIOLENTLY --

55   OMITTED

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT FIVE    53.

56   EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID (OPTICAL)

	A huge EXPLOSION obliterates the asteroid. The BLAST'S 
	SHOCKWAVE expands, heading for Sisko's Jem'Hadar ship

57A  INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - CONTROL ROOM

	As the ship shakes VIOLENTLY, Sisko and his crew hang 
	on for dear life.

					O'BRIEN
			It must've gone off early.

					SISKO
			Dax -- get us out of here!

	Dax quickly takes back helm control.

57B  EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID (OPTICAL)

	Sisko's Jem'Hadar ship moves directly towards camera 
	just slightly ahead of the oncoming explosion. The 
	ship's tail is all but engulfed in the blast.

59   INT. JEM'HADAR SHIP - CONTROL ROOM

	Sisko and his crew grab hold of what they can as they try 
	to ride out the "wave."

59A  EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID (OPTICAL)

	Finally, Sisko's ship pulls ahead of the explosion and 
	continues on its way to safety.

59B  RESUME

	As the ship rights itself and the crew realize they're 
	going to survive after all:

					GARAK 
			Not quite according to plan... but 
			I think Starfleet will find the 
			results satisfactory.

 DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT FIVE 54-58.   

59B  CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			I agree, Mister Garak.
				(to Dax)
			Well done, old man.

	Sisko then moves over to O'Brien, who has been checking 
	the various consoles.

					SISKO 
			How bad is it?

					O'BRIEN
			It doesn't look good. I'm going 
			to have to switch to auxiliary 
			life support... deflectors are 
			down... guidance system is shot... 
			and...

	O'Brien sighs -- that's not all the bad news.

					SISKO 
			What is it?

					O'BRIEN
			The core matrix is fried. We 
			don't have warp drive.

					GARAK
				(concerned) 
			Forgive my ignorance, but without 
			warp drive... how long is it going 
			to take us to reach the nearest 
			Federation starbase?

					SISKO
			A long time, Mister Garak.

					GARAK 
			How long.

					BASHIR 
			Seventeen years, two months, and 
			three days... give or take an hour.

	And off this grim moment, we go to --

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Time to Stand" - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT FIVE    59.

59C  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Jem'Hadar ship drifts amongst the stars. And we:
