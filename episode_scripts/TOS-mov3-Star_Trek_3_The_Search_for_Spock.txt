                                                                  October 7, 1983



                   

                   FADE IN:

               1   SPACE - A STARFIELD - (ILM SHOT)                              1

                   As the stars appear, we hear the AMBIENCE OF SPACE, a
                   litany of groans, squeals and pings of the unknown.
                   Over this we SUPER:

                   "PARAMOUNT PICTURES PRESENTS:"

                   We are MOVING through the stars slowly and to our right
                   as the SUPER FADES. And we hear a hoarse voice.

                                           SPOCK (V.O.)
                             Space... the final frontier.

                   Our MOVE CONTINUES to reveal the Genesis planet and its
                   sun, which flares into our lens.

                                           SPOCK (V.O.)
                                     (continuing)
                             These are the continuing voyages
                             of the Starship Enterprise. Her
                             ongoing mission...

                   The sunflare has DISSOLVED us to the planet's primal
                   surface. We are MOVING through the trees and greens of
                   this Eden-like place. A soft, smoky haze covers every-
                   thing.

                                           SPOCK (V.O.)
                                     (continuing)
                             To explore strange new worlds...
                             To seek out new life forms, and
                             new civilizations... To boldly go,
                             where no man has gone before...

                   And now, amid the trees, we see it, and CAMERA comes to
                   a brief rest: Spock's casket, a photon torpedo tube,
                   black with red letters, "Mark VI." The STAR TREK FAN-
                   FARE is heard, and we SUPER:

                   "STAR TREK III : THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK"

                   The CREDITS BEGIN. As they appear, we MOVE away from
                   the casket and through the lush forest.

                   The haze thickens, until at last it becomes an obliter-
                   ating cloud, and then we DISSOLVE through into moving
                   clouds of the planet's atmosphere, and PULL BACK from
                   them, DISSOLVING once again back to space and the Gene-
                   sis planet where we HOLD as CREDITS END.

                   Then, a final SUPER:

                   "THE GENESIS PLANET.
                   STARDATE: 8001.3"

                   We hear the SOUND of an approaching SPACESHIP.

               2   SPACE - USS GRISSOM - (ILM SHOT)                             2

                   A mid-sized Federation Science Vessel approaching at
                   impulse power. She PASSES CAMERA, and we PAN WITH her
                   to see her path leads to the Genesis Planet in the
                   distance.

               3   INT. BRIDGE - USS GRISSOM                                    3
 
                   Starfleet LIEUTENANT SAAVIK, looking radiant, is wear-
                   ing her hair down these days, but is as intense and
                   efficient as ever. The CRACKLE OF ELECTRONIC ACTIVITY
                   fills the air.

                             So noted in ship's log.

                   She delivers the log to the Captain as ANGLE WIDENS to

                   ANGLE WIDENS to reveal DAVID MARCUS, mid-twenties, who
                   will be remembered as the co-creator of Genesis, and
                   also as Kirk's son.

                                           DAVID
                             Thank you, Captain. Begin
                             scanning, please.

                   Saavik has taken a position next to David at the sci-
                   ence panel and together they begin activating the de-
                   vices.

                                           DAVID
                                     (continuing;

                             This is where the fun begins,
                             Saavik!

                             It's snow. Snow in the same
                             sector. Fantastic!

                             weather known to Earth within a
                             few hours walk!

                                     (to him)
                             You must be very proud of what you
                             and your mother have created.

                                           DAVID
                                     (checking)
                             It's a little early to celebrate.

                   Suddenly... BEEP... BEEP... BEEP... a new and unique
                   SOUND is heard from the MONITORS. Saavik flicks con-
                   trols and a new image appears on screen.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Same sector. Metallic mass.

                                           DAVID
                             Underground deposit?

                                           SAAVIK
                             Negative, on surface... A
                             manufactured object.

                                           DAVID
                             There's only one thing it could
                             be... Short range scan.

                   Saavik complies. David's intensity rises. Captain
                   Esteban, curious about the BEEPS, has joined them.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Approximately two meters long...
                             Cylindrical in form...

                                           DAVID
                             A photon tube...!

                                           ESTEBAN
                             Could it be Spock's?

                                           DAVID
                             It has to be. Gravitational
                             fields were in flux... It must
                             have soft landed...!

                             Captain's Spock's tube located
                             intact on Genesis surface. Will
                             relay more data on subsequent
                             orbits.

                                           COMM OFFICER
                             Yes sir... Coding your message.

                   As the BEEPS DIMINISH, we HOLD on David and Saavik.
                   There is mystery in the air.

                                                                          CUT TO:

               4   SPACE - USS ENTERPRISE - (ILM SHOT)                          4

                   She comes AT US slowly, majestically, a great wounded
                   bird limping home, showing, as she passes, the patched
                   scars of battle. Over this we hear:

                                           KIRK (V.O.)
                             USS Enterprise, Captain's personal
                             log... With most of our battle
                             damage repaired, we are almost
                             home. Yet, I feel -- uneasy. And
                             I wonder why.

               5   INT. BRIDGE - USS ENTERPRISE - CLOSE - JAMES T. KIRK         5

                   He is stalking the bridge, lost in his thoughts.
                   CAMERA IS MOVING with him. In b.g., bridge activity is
                   normal.

                                           KIRK (V.O.)
                             ... Perhaps it is the erratic
                             behavior of Ship's surgeon
                             McCoy... Or the emptiness of this
                             vessel: most of our trainee crew
                             have been reassigned; Lieutenant
                             Saavik and my son David are
                             exploring a new world... and
                             Enterprise feels like a house with
                             all the children gone... No. More
                             empty even than that...

                   He has reached Spock's vacant chair. He touches it.

                                           KIRK (V.O.)
                                     (continuing)
                             The news of Spock's tube has
                             shaken me.
                                     (beat)
                             It seems that I have left the
                             noblest part of myself back there,
                             on that newborn planet.

                   We HOLD on him. Then, he shakes off his mood and:

                   Kirk heads for the elevator, presses the door button.
                   He is about to enter when he is intercepted by TRAINEE
                   FOSTER, a young black officer too eager for protocol.

                   Kirk turns.

                   He enters the elevator, and the doors close.

                   Even as the doors close, his mood changes. The mantle
                   of command falls away and he allows himself the luxury
                   of his deeper feelings. Feelings of aloneness. And
                   grief. CAMERA IN CLOSE to HOLD this anguished moment.
                   Then, an intrusive interruption. Kirk covers hiss feel-

                   Bones, his eyes far away, turns to make contact. In a
                   matter-of-fact voice:

                   Even Bones is stunned by what has come out of his
                   mouth. He tries to cope with his own disorientation.

                   Bones looks at Kirk for an agonized moment. Then, the
                   elevator comes to a stop, the doors opens. McCoy takes
                   a step out, then turns back to Kirk.

                   McCoy leaves. The doors close on Jim Kirk's concern.

                   Kruge's hand as it snaps switches.

                   Breathtaking. Skeletally at first, then filled in a
                   section at a time, a small deadly looking warship
                   forms. It is the Bird of Prey, a long-necked, scary
                   looking thing, with variable wing attitude which we
                   will see in time.

                   Kruge rises from his regal station, crosses to a moni-
                   tor where OFFICER MALTZ adjusts incoming material. We
                   cannot see clearly what is coming in, but occasional
                   images suggest material concerning the Genesis Project.

                   And through it all, in the smoke, the Woman's face.
                   Unperturbed. As a last act, she ritualistically covers
                   her face with her veil, as she is enveloped in smoke

                   The SCREAMS AND CRIES of the merchant crew can be
                   heard. The Captain's voice rises above all these.

                             For God's sake, help us!

                   The Klingon Bird FIRES another salvo. The merchantman
                   is obliterated. Debris floats through the SHOT.

                   The screams have stopped. Kruge's beats reacts with
                   pleasure. Officer Maltz observes this, subtly wipes
                   his forehead, but making sure Kruge doesn't see him.
                   Kruge pets his beast, then straightens, recording in 
                   hand.

                   As Kruge starts out, the BEAST GROWLS. Kruge stops,
                   points a finger at a Klingon in the sub-deck below.

                   The Klingon nods vigorously as Kruge exits, then, with
                   his commander gone, casts a nervous glance beast-ward.

                   with the grandeur of the horizon arc of the great blue
                   marble as a backdrop, Spacedock orbits. INTO SHOT

                   The bustle and CRACKLING SOUNDS of approach procedure.
                   Kirk is in the Captain's chair, all others are on sta-
                   tions. Scotty has come up from below to watch the

                   The slowly rotating Spacedock is huge. Enterprise is
                   coming in on an arc-like course.

                   The great doors of Approach Threshold 15 slide open...

                   Enterprise, with unerring precision, slips from space
                   into the small opening afforded by the doors... and...

                   A huge, cavernous area, deigned as an orbital dock for
                   many space vessels. We see Enterprise entering this
                   great warehouse of ships through the doors, and proceed
                   at slow impulse power to her waiting birth.

                   introducing NX 2000, Excelsior, a super starship. Her
                   lines are similar to Enterprise, but she is clearly
                   bigger, sleeker, and very new. She sits at her mooring
                   like the new Queen of Space.

                   THROUGH THE WINDOW of a Spacedock facility, a few
                   lounging Starfleet persons look up to see a memorable
                   sight...

                   ... battle-scarred Enterprise is passing alongside of
                   the sleek Excelsior. Their size differential is
                   apparent (B-29 to B-17). Yet, Enterprise carries with
                   her a battle-scarred history of achievement. Some of
                   the Starfleet people begin to rise, silently. A stand-
                   ing ovation for a hero's return.

                             Nevertheless -- I am reading a
                             life form there.

                   Kirk rises on the narrow edge of irritation.

                                           KIRK
                             Mr. Chekov -- this entire crew
                             seems on the edge of obsessive
                             behavior concerning Mr. Spock.
                                     (stays Chekov's protest)
                             I'll have a look... Mr. Sulu,
                             continue docking procedure.

                   He exits, as the rest of the crew reacts. Chekov
                   shrugs to all, indicating that he sees what he sees.
                   And the CAMERA MOVES CLOSE to his panel to verify his
                   belief. On screen -- an energy form is definitely
                   pulsating.

                   as they HISS open, and Kirk appears. A SOFT ALARM is 
                   BEEPING O.S. Kirk assesses this, his mood changing to
                   puzzled concern. He starts purposefully OUT OF SHOT.

                   He is walking quickly, as the ALARM SOUND increases in
                   frequency. He reacts: breaks into a trot, CAMERA
                   SPEEDING UP WITH him until he arrives at the entrance
                   to Spock's quarters. He examines with shock: a seal-
                   ant coating over the door has been forced with indica-
                   tions of great strength. The ALARM CONTINUES, LOUD
                   now. Kirk TURNS IT OFF with a touch, then cautiously
                   starts in, convinced the problem is real.

                   It is dark and shadowy as Kirk enters. He peers, try-
                   ing to adjust his eyesight to the darkness. He steps
                   forward carefully -- trips temporarily on some small
                   object -- but recovers. He moves slowly inward, then
                   stops, staring into the impenetrable dark. Then he
                   reacts, as we hear SPOCK'S VOICE. It is hoarse, raspy,
                   as it was in the final scene with Kirk in Star Trek
                   II. But is unmistakably Spock.

                   as he starts forward, all senses alert. As he nears
                   the figure, whoever it is starts to flee, and Kirk
                   grapples with him, like Jacob with the dark Angel. And
                   Kirk pulls him down, panting, and the figure is il-
                   luminated by a shaft of light, and it is --

                   Bones looks at him, trying to comprehend. When he 
                   opens his mouth; it is, for one brief moment, SPOCK'S
                   VOICE that emerges:

                             Remember!

                   Kirk stares at him in shock as:

                   Kirk, still holding McCoy:

                   FINISES -- and the great docking doors open.

                                           SULU
                             Tetsch-hut!

                  STARFLEET COMMANDER MORROW enters, a distinguished
                  looking black man, followed by an AIDE. He crosses to
                  Kirk at the head of the review line.

                                           KIRK
                             Welcome aboard, Admiral.

                                           MORROW
                             Welcome home, Jim.

                   He reaches for Kirk's shoulders with affection.

                                           MORROW
                                     (continuing)
                             Well done.

                   He embraces Kirk. It is both a military courtesy, and
                   a personal expression, twenty-five years of comrade-
                   ship, service and sacrifice. Kirk is moved. When the
                   embrace breaks:

                                           KIRK
                             Thank you, sir.
                                     (wryly)
                             I take it this is not a formal
                             inspection.

                   A relieved ripple of laughter from all.

                                           MORROW
                             No. At ease, everyone.

                   They relax in the glow of Morrow's smile. And he looks
                   about.

                                           MORROW
                                     (continuing)
                             Where's Doctor McCoy?

                                           KIRK
                                     (a beat)
                             Indisposed, sir.

                                           MORROW
                             Ah, too bad... Well... You have
                             all done remarkable service under
                             the most -- difficult of
                             conditions. You'll be receiving
                             Starfleet's highest commendations,
                             and more importantly, extended
                             shore leaves.

                   A buzz of approval, then:

                                           MORROW
                                     (continuing)
                             That is, all but you, Mr. Scott.
                             They need your wisdom on the new
                             Excelsior... Report there tomorrow
                             as Captain of Engineering.

                   It is clear how Scotty feels about this honor:

                                           SCOTTY
                             With all appreciation, sir, I'd
                             prefer to supervise the refit of
                             Enterprise.

                                           MORROW
                             Yes, well... That really won't be
                             necessary...

                                           SCOTTY
                             But sir -- this refit will take a 
                             practiced hand. There's much to
                             do --
                                     (a look at Kirk)
                             It could be months.

                                           MORROW
                             No, Mr. Scott, I'm sorry... There
                             isn't going to be a refit.

                   A pall in the room. Kirk, as shocked as anyone.

                                           KIRK
                             Admiral, I don't understand. The
                             Enterprise --

                                           MORROW
                             Jim, the Enterprise is twenty
                             years old. We think her day is
                             over...

                                           KIRK
                             But, we had requested -- we were
                             hoping to take her back to
                             Genesis...

                                           MORROW
                                     (a new concern)
                             Genesis?! Whatever for?

                                           KIRK
                             Why -- a natural desire to help
                             finish the work we began!

                                           MORROW
                             That's out of the question. No
                             one is going to Genesis!
          
                                           KIRK
                             May I ask why...?

                                           MORROW
                                     (a sigh)
                             Jim, in your absence, Genesis has
                             become a galactic controversy...
                             Until the Federation Council makes
                             policy, you are all under orders
                             not to discuss with anyone your 
                             knowledge of Genesis... Consider
                             it a quarantined planet. And a
                             forbidden subject.

                   On their baffled reactions we...

              44   EXT. SPACE - THE BIRD OF PREY - (ILM SHOT)                  44

                   We are TRACKING with her through space. She is quite
                   visible, her wings in level configuration.

              45   INT. BRIDGE - BIRD OF PREY - VERY CLOSE - MONITOR           45

                   At first we are disoriented. Jim Kirk's image FILLS
                   THE SCREEN talking right AT US.

                                           KIRK'S IMAGE
                             To fully understand the events on
                             which I report, it is necessary to
                             review the theoretical data on the
                             Genesis Device...

                   We are PULLING BACK. The bridge is lit normally. On
                   screen, Kirk's voice now continues, describing what we
                   see: molecular charts, followed by a barren graphic
                   depiction of a planetoid. Toward it a torpedo arcs,
                   causing fire, inferno, and a resulting new surface,
                   capable of bearing life. (COMPUTER GRAPHIC, STAR TREK
                   II.) This is being watched on the bridge by Kruge,
                   Maltz, and OFFICER TORG, younger than Maltz, more gung-
                   ho.

              46   INTERCUT - THE GENESIS TAPE                                 46

                   with the reactions of the two junior officers, seeing
                   it for the first time.

                   Kruge turns the machine off. He studies the two
                   officers. Then with quiet intensity:

                                           KRUGE
                             So!

                   Kruge considers the answer, turns to Maltz.

                                           MALTZ
                             Yes, my lord!

                   Maltz snaps to and leaves, chastened. Kruge turns to
                   Torg like a wily serpent.

                                           KRUGE
                             It works. Oh yes, it works.

                   He presses a button and a new visual appears, Kirk's
                   VOICE heard OVER:

                             "... It was this premature

                   We see Enterprise fleeing the Genesis explosion (STOCK,
                   STAR TREK II). Torg is very impressed. Kruge turns
                   the visual off. Then, importantly:

                                     (looking as perplexed
                                      as she can)

                                     (cutting in)
                             I'll handle that later.

                                           SAAVIK
                             My readings indicate great
                             instability.

                                           DAVID
                             We're not here to investigate
                             geological aging, we're here to

                                           DAVID
                                     (continuing)
                             Come on...

                   Saavik reacts to his tension with a questioning look.
                   Then they move off.

              52   INT. GRISSOM BRIDGE - FAVORING ESTEBAN (INTERCUT            52
                   WITH SAAVIK)

                   He and his officers are monitoring the progress of the
                   landing party. DATA SOUNDS fill the bridge.
  
                   Then, LT. HINES points something out on a viewscreen.

                                           ESTEBAN
                             Grissom to landing party. We have
                             you approaching radioactive
                             indications. Do you concur?

                                           SAAVIK (V.O.)
                             Affirmative, Captain. Our
                             readings are well below danger
                             level.

                                           ESTEBAN
                             Very well. Exercise caution,
                             Lieutenant. This landing is
                             Captain's discretion and I'm the
                             one who's out on a limb.

                                           SAAVIK (V.O.)
                             I'll try to remember that,
                             Captain.

              53   EXT. GENESIS PLANET - HIGH SHOT - SPOCK'S GLADE - DAY       53

                   David is in the lead, a distant figure, then stops to
                   take readings as Saavik catches up to him. Then to-
                   gether they start forward TOWARD US. As they approach,
                   HIGH CAMERA NOW LOWERS until it reveals, in f.g.,
                   Spock's casket.

              54   EXT. GENESIS PLANET - SERIES OF SHOTS (ILM)                 54

                   The two explorers take readings; they begin to realize
                   what they are heading for...

                   Their tempo increases, they follow their tricorders,
                   until...

              55   EXT. GENESIS - SPOCK'S CASKET IN FOREGROUND                 55

                   Saavik and David come INTO VIEW, close by, and stop,
                   seeing it.

                                           DAVID
                   .          .. Spock's tube...

                                           SAAVIK
                                     (steps forward,
                                      points)
                             David --

                   He joins her, staring at:

              56   POV - SPOCK'S CASKET - (ILM SHOT)                           56

                   At the base of the tube, worm-like forms shimmy and
                   squirm. They are small , horrible, and unquestionably
                   alive.

              57   SAAVIK AND DAVID                                            57

                   They try to maintain their scientific objectivity, in
                   spite of their horror -- and their disappointment at
                   not finding some trace of Spock.

                                           DAVID
                             Well. There's your life form
                             reading. These were microbes on
                             the tube's surface. We shot them
                             here from Enterprise.
                                     (with irony)
                             They were fruitful, and
                             multiplied.

                                           SAAVIK
                             But... How could they have evolved
                             so quickly...?

                   David doesn't answer, his curiosity caught by something
                   else. He starts slowly forward, Saavik Following
                   close. Their tricorders begin to register higher radia-
                   tion levels as they approach the tube.

                   David and Saavik's faces as they approach.

                   Feet step among the wormy creatures to gain access to
                   the tube. (ILM)

                   Even the unemotional Saavik reacts to this.

                   David reaches the tube, raises the lid of Spock's bier.
                   He looks inside, and sees:

              59   DAVID'S POV INTO SPOCK'S CASKET                             59

                   It is empty, except for some kind of rumpled black
                   cloth.

              60   BACK TO DAVID                                               60

                   He reacts, stunned.

                                           DAVID
                             Saavik... He's gone.

                   He reaches in, withdraws the shroud-like cloth, and
                   hands it to Saavik. As she touches, she knows.

                                           DAVID
                                     (continuing)
                             What is it?

                                           SAAVIK
                             Spock's burial robe.

                   As they stare at each other without answers, the planet
                   makes a gentle RUMBLING SOUND -- then the ground qui-
                   vers slightly.

                   And in the far distance, a poignant CRY is heard. A
                   young animal in pain, perhaps. Saavik and David do not
                   know.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   Tranquil. We hear the SOUNDS of HARBOR and distant
                   CITY. We are PULLING BACK, past Kirk as he stares qui-
                   etly at the view, a glass in hand. Then he turns
                   'round, raises his glass in a toast.

                   ANGLE WIDENS to include Uhura, Chekov and Sulu, who
                   toast in response, and drink.

                                           SULU
                             ... Admiral, what's going to
                             happen to Enterprise?

                                           KIRK
                             She's to be decommissioned.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Will we get another ship?

                                           KIRK
                             I can't get an answer. Starfleet
                             is up to its brass in galactic
                             conference. No one has time for
                             those who only stand... and wait.

                   Kirk sips his drink thoughtfully, as do all. Then:

                                           UHURA
                             How is Doctor McCoy, sir?

                                           KIRK
                             That's the good news. He's home
                             in bed, full of tranquilizers, and
                             he promised me he'd stay there...
                             They say it's exhaustion...
                                     (a sigh)
                             We'll see.

                   A DOOR CHIME.

                                     (continuing)
                             Ah. Mr. Scott, fresh from the
                             world of transwarp drive... Come!

                   They all turn toward the door. We hear it WHIRR open,
                   O.S. Their expressions change and they stare at:

              62   THEIR POV - ANGLE TOWARD THE DOOR                           62

                   A tall, mysterious figure in a hooded Vulcan robe walks
                   slowly toward us, then stops, CLOSE, face unseen. Is
                   it Bones?... A Spock apparition? The figure removes
                   his hood, revealing the distinguished older features
                   of:

                             Sarek!

                   A hush of wonder falls over all. The ANGLE WIDENS as
                   AMBASSADOR SAREK comes to Kirk.

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                             Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you
                             were here...
                                     (then)
                             I think you know my crew...

                                           SAREK
                             I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

                   Kirk turns to his crew. They look at him questioningly.

                                           KIRK
                             Excuse us, please.

                   The crew, their concern showing, leave their glasses
                   and file out. Sarek steps to the bay window, looks out
                   in contemplation, his back to Kirk. With the others
                   gone, Kirk comes up behind Sarek. A pause. Then:

                             Sarek... I would have come to
                             Vulcan... to express my deepest
                             sympathies...

                             Spare me your human platitudes,
                             Kirk. I have been to your
                             Government. I have seen the
                             Genesis information, and your own
                             report.

                             Then you know how bravely your son
                             met his death.

                             How could you, his friend, have
                             assumed that? Why did you leave
                             him on Genesis! Spock trusted you
                             -- and you denied him his future!

                             I -- saw no future --

                             You missed the point, then and
                             now... Only his body was "in
                             death," Kirk! And you were the
                             last one to be with him.

                             Yes, I was...

                                           SAREK
                             Then you must know that you should

                             But -- why?

                                           SAREK
                             Because he asked you to! He
                             entrusted you with his very
                             essence -- with everything
                             was not of the body. He asked you
                             to bring him to us -- and to bring
                             that which he gave you: his
                             Katra. His living spirit.

                             Sir. Your son meant more to me
                             than you can know. I'd have given
                             my life if it would have saved
                             his. You must believe me when I
                             tell you that he made no request
                             of me!

                                           SAREK
                             He would not have spoken of it
                             openly.

                             Then, how --

                                           SAREK
                                     (interrupting)
                             Kirk, I must have your thoughts.
                             May I join your mind?

                             Of course...!

                   Sarek steps close to Kirk as CAMERA PUSHES IN VERY
                   CLOSE. Sarek's hands are on Kirk's temples in familiar
                   splayed fashion. And the eyes of both men are closed.

                   Strange, SUB-MUSICAL SOUNDS underscore. The music of
                   Vulcan, unlike anything we have ever heard before.
                   After a moment:

                                           SAREK

                             He asked you not to grieve...

`
                   Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain.
                   Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches
                   Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.

                                           SAREK
                             Forgive me. It is not here. I
                             assumed he had mind-melded with
                             you. It is the Vulcan way when
                             the body's end is near.

                                           KIRK
                             But he couldn't touch me...! We
                             were separated!

                                           SAREK
                             I see... and I understand.
                                     (rises wearily)
                             Then everything that he was...
                             Everything that he knew... is
                             lost. And when I return home
                             empty-handed, many shall mourn.

                   He turns now, starting for the door. Kirk stops him
                   with an agonized wail:

                                           KIRK
                             Please wait!... Surely he would
                             have found a way! If there was so
                             much at stake -- Spock would have
                             found a way!

                                           SAREK
                                     (hesitating)
                             Yes... But -- how...?

                                           KIRK
                                     (rising)
                             Sarek!... What if he melded with
                             someone else?!

                   On their exchange of looks --

              66   INT. SMALL ELECTRONIC CENTER                                66

                   We are VERY CLOSE on an electronic screen. There is
                   the frozen face of Spock with his hand splayed on the
                   engine room glass. A mechanical voice tells us:

                                           COMPUTER VOICE

                             Back. Point seven seven.

                   The tape begins to speed backwards in a scrambled
                   image.

              67   REVERSE ANGLE - CLOSE - KIRK (INTERCUT WITH SCREEN)         67

                   His face intense. The SOUND of BACKWARD TAPE is heard.
                   Then it stops.

                   On screen: Spock and Kirk in their final conversation.
                   Kirk watches a moment, painfully, then breaks off:

                                           KIRK
                             Back. Point seven six.

                   The computer responds. More BACKWARD SOUND, then:

                                           COMPUTER VOICE

                             Go.

                   The tape activates. On screen we watch Spock enter the
                   engine room, go to the console. He make a few adjust-
                   ments then heads for the radiation room where he is
                   intercepted by McCoy.

                   Kirk stares in growing fascination.

                   McCoy talks to Spock briefly. Spock tricks McCoy into
                   looking away, then applies the Vulcan nerve pinch.
                   Bones falls.

                   On screen: Spock moves close to McCoy, takes gloves
                   from the unconscious Scott, then places his hand on
                   McCoy's temple.
                                 
                                           SPOCK'S IMAGE
                             Remember.

                                           KIRK
                             Hold!

                   He stares at the frozen image, then:

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                             Augment and repeat!

                   The CAMERA ZOOMS IN a TIGHT TWO SHOT. The action
                   repeats:

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE
                             Remember!

                                           KIRK

                             Freeze...!

                   The image of the critical mind meld is there to see.
                   Kirk is stunned.

                   CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS now, to reveal for the first time
                   that Sarek is with Kirk in the shadowy room.

                                           KIRK
                             Bones!...

                             One alive, one not. Yet both in
                             pain.

                                           KIRK
                             What must I do?

                                           SAREK
                             You must bring them to Mount
                             Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there
                             is the passage possible. Only
                             there can both find peace...

                                           KIRK
                             What you ask is difficult.

                                           SAREK
                             You will find a way, Kirk. If you
                             honor them both, you must.

                   Kirk looks at the screen, examines all that is clear to
                   him, and accepts the truth of Sarek's challenge.

                                           KIRK
                             I will. I swear.

                   Over his determined face, we hear a weird OVERLAPPED
                   SOUND: the strange CRY OF PAIN from the Genesis
                   Planet.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   A different texture than the Spock Glade. Cactus
                   growth, seeming desert, yet... slightly gnarled,
                   slightly off. Over this empty landscape there is
                   another trembling of the earth. And again, the CRY.

                   The SOUND OF RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then David and Saavik
                   run INO SHOT staring O.S. as the CRY repeats itself.

                   They stare O.S. and see:

                   Past the tall cactus in f.g., we see snow-covered ter-
                   rain in the middle distance. The CRY is heard once
                   more.

              72   BACK TO THEM                                                72

                             We hear it whenever the ground
                             quakes.

                   David's tricorder is making LIFE FORM SOUNDS. Saavik
                   whips out her communicator.

                             proceeding to investigate.

                             We concur, Saavik. And Saavik...
                             be advised we are reading a severe
                             and unnatural age curve on the
                             planet. I'm getting nervous...

                             Do you have an explanation?

                                           DAVID
                             Later. Let's go...

                                           SAAVIK
                             Grissom, your message acknowledged.
                             Will advise... Out.

                   And she hurries after David.

              73   INT. BRIDGE - GRISSOM - FAVORING ESTEBAN                    73

                                           ESTEBAN
                             USS Grissom, out.
                                     (bends over his
                                      science station)
                             What the hell's going on down
                             there?!

              74   EXT. GENESIS PLANET - AREA 3 - SNOWSCAPE (ILM --            74
                   VISTAVISION)

                   David leading, Saavik catching up as they enter a snow-
                   covered patch of ground. CAMERA TRACKS with them now
                   as the WIND begins to HOWL, and the first visible snow-
                   flakes begin to fall. As the wind and snow increase,
                   causing them to hold their hands up against the ele-
                   ments, they stop and stare outward.

              75   THEIR POV                                                   75

                   In the snow-covered landscape ahead of them, a series
                   of tracks. Small, indeterminate. They lead ahead.

              76   BACK TO SAAVIK AND DAVID                                    76

                   They respond. The WIND HOWLS, but they start forward.

                                                                          CUT TO:

              77   INT. STARFLEET OFFICER'S LOUNGE - ADMIRAL MORROW            77
                   - NIGHT

                                           MORROW
                             No. Absolutely not, Jim, it's out
                             of the question!

                    ANGLE HAS WIDENED to include Kirk, a passionate Kirk.

                                           KIRK
                                     (deeply)
                             Harry. I'm off the record now.
                             I'm not speaking as one of your
                             staff. I'm talking about thirty
                             years of service. I have to do
                             this, Harry. It has to do with my
                             honor, my life -- everything I put
                             any value on.

                   The intimacy of the conversation is broken by a star-
                   fleet steward who bears drinks. Kirk sits in frus-
                   trated suspension until the steward leaves. Then Kirk
                   tries to resume his plea, but Morrow stays him.

                                           MORROW
                             Jim... You are my best officer and
                             if I had a best friend, you'd be
                             that too. But I am Commander,
                             Starfleet, so I don't break rules!

                                           KIRK
                             Don't quote rules, Harry! We're
                             talking about loyalty.
                             And sacrifice. One man who died
                             for us, another who has deep
                             emotional damage --

                                           MORROW
                             Now wait a minute! This business
                             about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly,
                             I have never understood Vulcan
                             mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part
                             of me doesn't want you to make a
                             fool of yourself... Understand?

                                           KIRK
                             Harry, you don't have to believe!
                             I'm not even sure I believe. But
                             if there's even a chance that
                             Spock has an eternal soul -- then
                             that is my responsibility.

                                           MORROW
                             Yours...?!

                                           KIRK
                             As surely as if it were my own!
                                     (deeply)
                             Harry, give me back the
                             Enterprise! With Scotty's help...

                                           MORROW
                             No, Jim! Enterprise would never
                             stand the pounding.

                                           KIRK
                             Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire
                             a ship.

                                           MORROW
                             Out of the question! The Council
                             has ordered that no one but the
                             science team goes to Genesis!

                                           KIRK
                                     (desperately)
                             Then let me speak to the
                             Council! Harry, please! I can
                             make them understand!!

                   Kirk's voice and passion has risen enough to now
                   gather a response from neighboring tables. Kirk re-
                   alizes; he checks himself, draws slightly back. Morrow
                   is firm.

                                           MORROW
                             No, you understand...! The
                             Council has its hands full with
                             Klingons and Romulans! They're
                             trying to hammer out a treaty on
                             the Genesis Device and they
                             haven't got time for your personal
                             views on friendship and
                             metaphysics!
                                     (beat)
                             Jim! Your life and your career
                             stand for rationality, not
                             intellectual chaos. Keep up this
                             emotional behavior and you'll lose
                             everything. You'll destroy
                             yourself!
                                     (deeply)
                             Do you hear me, Jim?

                   Kirk looks for a long moment, then sighs, his body
                   sagging.

                                           KIRK
                             Yes... I hear you.
                                     (a beat)
                             I just had to try.

                                           MORROW
                             Of course... Now take my
                             suggestion, enjoy your leave --
                             and let all this tension blow
                             away.

                                           KIRK
                                     (a sigh)
                             You're right.
                                     (toasts)
                             Thanks for the drink.

                                           MORROW
                             Any time.

                   Kirk rises with a smile, starts out. HOLD on Morrow.

              78   MOVING WITH KIRK                                            78

                   He crosses the room filled with Starfleet senior
                   officers, CAMERA TRACKING until he passes out of the
                   main room, into the entry room -- where we are sur-
                   prised to see Sulu and Chekov waiting for him conspir-
                   atorially. Kirk stops close to them, looks about cau-
                   tiously.

                                           SULU
                             The word, sir?

                                           KIRK
                             The word is no.
                                     (a beat)
                             I am therefore going anyway.

                                           SULU
                             Count on our help, sir.

                                           KIRK
                             I'll need it, Sulu.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?

                                           KIRK
                             Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

                                                                          CUT TO:

              79   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                            79

                   A crowded, smoke-filled watering hole of the twenty-
                   third century, filled with a smattering of civilians,
                   Starfleet personnel, and visitors from strange and far-
                   off civilizations. It does not have the bizarre quali-
                   ties of the "Star Wars Bar" which is across the
                   street.

                   McCoy is discovered entering the bar. He is haggard,
                   less than clean shaved. He appears to be looking for
                   something as he starts forward.

              80   HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH THE BAR (ILM ELEMENT)              80

                   noting patrons at the twenty-third century equivalent
                   of video games, darts. We see two people playing at a
                   holographic version of a video game, in which World War
                   1 biplanes are engaged in 3-d combat... and a dart
                   player throwing pneumatic jet propelled darts...

              81   BACK TO McCOY                                               81

                   Not finding what he is looking for, he settles into a
                   small alcove. A seedy, but attractive WAITRESS ar-
                   rives.

                                           WAITRESS
                             Long time, Doc.

                             Yeah... Anyone...  been looking for
                             me?

                                           WAITRESS
                             I have... But what's the use?
                                     (a smile)
                             What'll it be?

                             Not your usual poison.

                             To expect one to order poison in a
                             bar is not logical.

                             Got it.

                   She leaves. McCoy scans the room. He picks out some-
                   one approaching.

                   an exotic-looking grubby fellow with a big grin, making
                   his way unmistakably to McCoy's booth. PULL BACK with
                   him as he reaches it, and slides in ebulliently.

                             I think that's my line, stranger.

                                           ALIEN
                             Oh, forgive. I here am new. But
                             you are known, being McCoy from
                             Enterprise.

                                           McCOY
                             You have me at a disadvantage,
                             sir. You are --

                                           ALIEN
                             I name not important. You seek
                             I. Message received. Available
                             ship stands by.

                                           McCOY
                             Good. How soon and how much?

                                           ALIEN
                             How soon is now. How much is
                             where?

                                           McCOY
                             Where...

                                           ALIEN
                             Is yes. Where?

                                           McCOY
                             ... Somewhere in the Mutara
                             Sector.

                                           ALIEN
                             Oh. Mutara restricted. Take
                             permits many. Money, more.

                                           McCOY
                             There aren't going to be any damn
                             permits!
                                     (checking room)
                             How can you get a permit to do a
                             damn illegal thing?!
                                     (then)
                             Look, price you name, money I got.

                                           ALIEN
                             You name place, I name money.
                             Otherwise, bargain, no.

                                           McCOY
                                     (getting louder)
                             Alright, dammit. It's Genesis.
                             The name of the place we're going
                             is Genesis.

                                           ALIEN
                                     (genuinely
                                      shocked)
                             Genesis!

                                           McCOY
                             Genesis, yes. How can you be deaf
                             with ears like that?

                                           ALIEN
                             Genesis allowed is not... Is
                             planet forbidden.

                                           McCOY
                             Now listen to me, my backwards
                             friend!
                                     (grabs the Alien
                                      by the collar)
                             Genesis may be "planet forbidden,"
                             but I'm damn well --

                   McCoy is interrupted by a hand on his arm. He looks up
                   to see a nondescript-looking CIVILIAN, with a gentle,
                   ingratiating manner.

                                           CIVILIAN
                             Sir... I'm sorry, but your voice
                             is carrying. I don't think you
                             want to be discussing this subject
                             in public.

                                           McCOY              
                             I'll discuss what I like, and who
                             the hell are you?!

                                           CIVILIAN
                             Could I offer you a ride home, Dr.
                             McCoy?

                                           McCOY
                             Where's the logic in offering me a
                             ride home, you idiot! If I wanted
                             a ride home, would I be trying to
                             charter a space flight?!
                                     (then)
                             How the hell do you know who I am?

                                           CIVILIAN
                             Federation Security, sir.

                   It's a bad moment for the agent to have announced him-
                   self. A desperate Bones releases the Alien and rises
                   to his feet just as the Waitress arrives with his Alt-
                   air water on a tray. The Altair water spills on the
                   Alien.

              83   SERIES OF CUTS                                               83

                   The Alien, hit by the water, leaps to his feet in rage.

                   The Waitress is knocked into a group of people.

                   More spilling of drinks.

                   A bystander, thinking the Alien hit the Waitress, hits
                   him.

                   A general scuffle begins.

                   Meanwhile, McCoy tries to race around the "Civilian's"
                   end of the confusion, but the agent (very big), grabs
                   him. Bones, in confusion and panic, suddenly turns,
                   wild-eyed, and attempts a Vulcan nerve pinch on his
                   tormentor. The nerve pinch has absolutely no effect,
                   and the agent stares at Bones for a long moment.

                                           CIVILIAN
                             You're going to get a nice, long
                             rest, Doctor.

                   He ushers Bones out as the brouhaha continues in b.g.

                                                                          CUT TO:

              84   EXT GENESIS PLANET - AREA 3 - SNOWSCAPE                     84

                   It is snowing now, and the WIND WAILS as Saavik and
                   David appear and come forward into a CLOSE SHOT. The
                   life sign sound of their TRICORDER is BEEPING faster
                   now as they peer ahead into the snow. Then Saavik
                   suddenly points:

              85   POV - THROUGH THE SNOWFALL                                  85

                   Something alive moves across the front, obscured by
                   snow and terrain.

              86   BACK TO THEM - MOVING CAMERA (INTERCUT WITH POV)            86

                   As they start forward into the snow, Saavik drawing her
                   phaser. They peer ahead, seeing nothing but the BLEEP
                   of their tricorder which they follow like a beacon.

                   Their POV MOVING through the snow flurry, catches an
                   occasional hint of something ahead which spurs them on.

                   Then, with the TRICORDER BEEP indicating very close
                   proximity, they stop and intuitively Saavik indicates
                   to David to turn the tricorder off. As the beep stops,
                   they listen and hear the tiniest of WHIMPERS amid the
                   WIND. They start out excitedly...

              87   THE CREVICE (AND INTERCUT POV'S)                            87

                   as Saavik and David approach. Stop. TRICORDER back
                   on. Big reading. They step forward through the snow
                   flurry to see:

              88   INT. THE CREVICE - THE BOY                                  88

                   A wild thing with scraggly hair, perhaps nine or ten
                   years old. He covers his nakedness as he shivers in
                   the cold clutching an injured leg; he watches the
                   strangers, and their BEEPING machine in hypnotic fear.
              
              89   THE SCENE - IN THE CREVICE                                  89

                   At Saavik's gesture, David turns off his tricorder.
                   Saavik moves close. As she touches the Boy's leg, he
                   pulls back and she reaches out to his face, and touches
                   his cheek softly. he accepts watchfully. Then Saavik
                   slides her hand slowly and parts the scraggly hair.
                   The Boy is a Vulcan.

                   Saavik and David exchange and astonished look. Then she
                   covers the boy with Spock's robe, and in Vulcan:

                                           SAAVIK
                             (I am Saavik... Can you speak?)

                   The Boy does not respond. Saavik looks to David.

                                           DAVID
                                     (in awe)
                             The Genesis Wave... His cells
                             could have been regenerated...
                             Reformed --

                   Quietly, so as not to alarm the Boy, Saavik opens her
                   communicator and reports softly:

                                           SAAVIK
                             Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...

                                           ESTEBAN (V.O.)
                             Yes, Saavik, go ahead...

                                           SAVVIK
                             We have found the life sign. It
                             is a Vulcan child, perhaps eight
                             to ten years of age.

                                           ESTEBAN (V.O.)
                             A child! That's extraodinary.
                             How did he get there?!

                                           SAAVIK
                             It is Dr. Marcus' opinion that
                             this is -- that the Genesis effect
                             has in some way regenerated --
                             Captain Spock.

              90   INT. BRIDGE - GRISSOM - FAVORING ESTEBAN (INTERCUT          90
                   WITH PLANET)

                  There is a moment of uncertainty between Esteban and
                  his science officers that should be one of the grand
                  laughs of this film.

                                           ESTEBAN
                                     (slowly and
                                      carefully)
                             Ah, Saavik, that's, ah,
                             extroadinary. What would you,
                             ah, like to do next?

                                           SAAVIK (V.O.)
                             Request permission to beam aboard
                             immediately.

                                           ESTEBAN
                             Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think
                             there could be -- any chance of --
                             ah -- radioactive contamination?

                                           SAAVIK (V.O.)
                             None that I can detect, sir.

                                           ESTEBAN
                             Well, all the same, I'm going to
                             advise Starfleet and get
                             instructions.

                   On the planet, Saavik and David exchange a frustrated
                   look.

                                           SAAVIK (V.O.)
                             I'm sure Starfleet would approve,
                             sir.

                                           ESTEBAN
                             I know, but -- let's do it by
                             the book. Stand by on this channel.
                                     (to Comm Officer)
                             Go.

                                           COMM OFFICER
                             Starfleet Command, this is the USS

                             in, please...

                   There is an odd SOUND on the speakers. Below, David
                   and Saavik wait impatiently. Then, on the bridge:

                   means of the de-cloaking effect, the Bird of Prey is
                   dead on a at close range in attack configuration.

                   his phaser and FIRES, obliterating the Gunner. No one
                   in the crew seems to take this as unusual behavior.
                   And Kruge adds, for his own justification:

                   STATIC is heard on her communicator. She folds it
                   closed in resignation. That unnerves David.

                             destroyed by an enemy attack.

                             like this?! We have to get thee

                   Kirk and GUARD 1 stand in the doorway which is framed by
                   line of light indicating a force field. Kirk is in

                   The Guard places an electronic "key" against a plate on
                   the wall. Force light blinks out. As Kirk enters the
                   cell, the Guard reactivates the force field and leaves.
                   Kirk moves quickly to Bones, kneeling beside him.

                             You're suffering from a Vulcan
                             mind meld, Doctor.

                             That's right.

                             Give me your arm. This will make
                             you well enough to travel.

                             How do you do this anyway?

             100   INT. PRISON OUTER OFFICE - ANGLE ON ENTRY DOOR - NIGHT     100

                   A SECOND GUARD is on duty with GUARD 1 as the door
                   slides open and Sulu enters with some urgency.

                                           SULU
                             Where's Admiral Kirk?

                                           GUARD 1
                             He's with the prisoner.

                                           SULU
                             Get him quickly. Commander,
                             Starfleet wants him right away.

                   Guard 1 fishes for his electronic key and leaves.
                   Guard 2, a big, paunchy man, stretches his girth and
                   yawns.

                                           SULU
                                     (continuing)
                             Keeping you busy?

                                           GUARD 2
                             Don't get smart, Tiny.

             101   CELL ENTRY AT DOORWAY                                      101

                   Guard 1 applies his device to the cell electronic
                   plate. Force fields blink out.

                                           GUARD 1
                             Admiral... Starfleet is...

                                           KIRK
                                     (stops him)
                             This man is sick! Look at him!

                   As the Guard moves to Bones, Kirk drops him with a
                   martial chop.

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                             Can you move?

                                           McCOY
                             Yah -- that's great stuff.

                   And they start out of shot.

             102   PRISON OFFICE                                              102

                   A BUZZING is heard from the Guard's console. Guard 2
                   picks up an earpiece (like Uhura's), holds it to ear
                   and answers.

                                           GUARD 2
                             Sixth Floor Holding... Yah, come
                             up and get him, his visitor's just
                             leaving.             
                                     (a beat)
                             What? Well, some Admiral name of
                             -- Kirk.
                                     (much squawk
                                      in ear)
                             Well how am I supposed to
                             know -- ? He's a damn Admiral!

                   He unplugs furiously, rises determinedly, and starts
                   for the door which, just before he reaches it, slides
                   open, revealing Kirk and Bones.

                                           GUARD 2
                                     (continuing)
                             What the hell's going --

                   He is cut short by a savage martial chop delivered by
                   Sulu from behind.

                                           SULU
                             The side elevator. Agents on
                             their way up.

                   Kirk nods and, followed by Bones, moves to the outer
                   door, opens it, and they hurry out. Meanwhile, Sulu
                   has stepped to the master console, a bank of flashing
                   lights and comm equipment. He reaches underneath with
                   an electronic device, then steps back as the entire
                   console shorts itself to oblivion in a shower of sparks
                   and electronic pain. Sulu starts out of the room, but
                   cannot resist stopping for a split second over the
                   fallen body of Guard 2.

                                           SULU
                                     (continuing)
                             Don't call me Tiny.

                   As Sulu hurries after the others, we PUSH gently to the
                   fallen giant, sleeping peacefully.

             103   INT. ELEVATOR - SULU, BONES, KIRK                          103

                   Kirk whips out his communicator as they descend.

                   Kirk flips his communicator closed. McCoy raises an
                   eyebrow.

                                           McCOY
                             You're taking me to the promised

             104   INT. SPACEDOCK - USS EXCELSIOR - (ILM SHOT)                104

                   The new Queen of Space is quietly docked, floodlit like
                   a great monument, but essentially in bed for the night.

             105   INT. DESERTED CORRIDOR - EXCELSIOR                         105

                   Mr. Scott, looking cautiously around, stands by the
                   elevator door in the empty corridor. The elevator door
                   opens, and as Scott is preparing to step in, CAPTAIN
                   STYLES steps out. Styles is an officer about Kirk's
                   age. If he's a little stuffy, it's pardonable; he
                   does, after all, have the plum assignment in all of
                   Starfleet.

                                           STYLES
                             Ah, Mr. Scott. Calling it a
                             night?

                                           SCOTTY
                             Ah, yes, Captain.

                                           STYLES
                             Turning in myself. Looking
                             forward to breaking some of
                             Enterprise's speed records
                             tommorrow.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Yes, sir. Good night.

                   The doors of the elevators close, leaving Scotty alone
                   inside. A slightly condescending MALE VOICE says:

                                           ELEVATOR (V.O.)
                             Level please!

                                           ELEVATOR (V.O.)
                             Thank you.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Up your shaft.

             106   INT. SPACEDOCK - ON USS ENTERPRISE - (ILM SHOT)            106

                   In contrast to Excelsior, she seems a ghost ship, unlit
                   and without signs of activity.
   
             107   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ENTERPRISE (ILM SHOT)              107

                   Eerie. Dark. A mysterious hand throws a switch at the
                   transporter panel, and the resulting glow reveals
                   Chekov. A BEAMING SOUND is heard and:

                   Mr. Scott materializes on a pod

                                           CHEKOV
                             Welcome home, Mr. Scott.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Thank you, Chekov... Let's get
                             some life in the old girl.

             108   INT. A SHABBY TRANSPORTER STATION - ON UHIRA - NIGHT       108

                             hours. All is well.

                   She releases comm and methodically begins adjusting
                   controls on her console as CAMERA WIDENS to reveal a
                   lanky, cynical Starfleet LIEUTENANT in his early twen-
                   ties; he leans back in his chair, hands clasped behind
                   his head.

                                           LIEUTENANT
                             You amaze me, Commander.

                                           UHURA
                                     (working)
                             How is that...?

                                           LIEUTENANT
                             A twenty year space veteran, yet
                             you ask for the worst duty station
                             in town. I mean, look at this
                             place: the hind end of space.

                                           UHURA
                             Peace and quiet appeals to me,
                             Lieutenant.

                                           LIEUTENANT
                             Well, maybe that's okay for
                             someone like you whose career is
                             winding down. But me: I need
                             some challenge in my life. Some
                             adventure... Even just a surprise
                             or two.

                                           UHURA
                             You know what they say, Lieutenant.
                             Careful what you wish for: you may
                             get it.

                   The entry door slides open and Kirk, Bones and Sulu
                   hurry in and begin walking without hesitation, toward
                   the pods.

                                           UHURA
                                     (continuing)
                             Gentlemen. Good evening.

                                           KIRK
                             Good evening, Commander. Everything
                             ready?

                                           UHURA
                             Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.

                   The parade of purposeful men passes the befuffled
                   Lieutenant as if he weren't there. He watches as they
                   settle themselves onto the pods, while Uhura busies
                   herself with the setting of controls. He crosses with
                   concern to where she is working so efficiently.

                                           LIEUTENANT
                                     (sotto)
                             Commander, these are some of the
                             most famous people in Starfleet!
                             Admiral Kirk, my God!

                                           UHURA
                             Good for you, Lieutenant.

                                           LIEUTENANT
                             But it's damn irregular. No
                             destination orders, no encoded
                             i.d...

                   sudden series of BANGS, SHAKES, COUGHS and WHEELS, as
                   if the ship had hit a series of potholes in space.

                             is to stop up the drain.

                   He hands McCoy a tiny microchip (INSERT). McCoy looks
                   up bewildered, still shaky from the chase.

                   There are smiles, but sober ones. And Kirk puts his
                   hand on Sulu's shoulder as he says:

                   Responding to Sulu's touch, she speeds off.

                   Maltz and a half-dozen Klingons are on station under
                   Torg. The young officer leans into a monitor with
                   interest. We see two BLIPS there, one converging on
                   the other.

                   DAY

                   We are on a Klingon TRICORDER which is BEEPING excitedly.
                   WIDEN to see that it is in Kruge's hand as he advances
                   rapidly, through the oddly changed glade.

             136   SPOCK'S GLADE - WIDER - STILL TRACKING                     136

                   A SERGEANT and one CREWMAN are with Kruge on the
                   planet, always a half step behind his brisk pace. The
                   TRICORDER'S BEEPING INCREASES with each step. Then,
                   abruptly, the PLANETARY RUMBLE is heard -- and the
                   Klingons -- and CAMERA -- STOP, listening to the
                   rumble.

                   The earth shakes. As it does, a hideous, high-pitched
                   SQUEAL is heard, nearby O.S. (This is different than
                   the cry we have heard on the planet.) As the surface
                   stops shaking, the SQUEAL TAPERS OFF -- but the TRI-
                   CORDER BEEPS remain very active. Kruge, his curiosity
                   inflamed, starts forward OUT OF SHOT, the others fol-
                   lowing.

                   The Spock casket is in the f.g. CAMERA RISES now as
                   the Klingons approach the casket, stop short in sur-
                   prise as they see:

                   Where the "squiggly forms" once were, now horrible 4-
                   foot-long SERPENTINE THINGS rise, Cobra-like, HISSING
                   and SQUEALING.

                   Kruge is impassive, the others a little shocked. The
                   Sergeant pulls his phaser -- but Kruge stops him with a
                   hand. Now Kruge regards the serpents... then steps
                   forward to them. He does this with total arrogance to
                   reassert his bravery to the crew. CAMERA PULLS with
                   Kruge. He smiles as he reaches the casket. Then he
                   reaches into the group of serpents.

                   SHOTS)

                   Kruge grasps one of the elusive Things, brings it close
                   for study. This has the macho quality of a bullfighter
                   getting within an inch of the bull. The crew watches
                   breathlessly. Then, suddenly --

                   The Thing makes a squidlike coiling motion and wraps
                   itself around Kruge's neck and right arm. It's squeez-
                   ing hard.

                   The crew reacts, but are wisely stayed by the Sergeant.
                   This is the boss's show.

                   Kruge responds in a worthy manner. Even though the 
                   Thing is coiling tightly, Kruge exerts all the strength
                   he has in what he correctly guesses to be the crea-
                   ture's jugular. The creature POPS -- its strength
                   collapses -- and it slithers down and falls away from
                   its conqueror.

                   He takes a moment to enjoy the crew's reaction... then:

                             here. Am resuming search.

                   The light around him begins to change dramatically. He
                   looks up, and reacts to:

                   The highest promontory on the small planet gives us a
                   view of the sunlight TERMINATOR LINE (the line between
                   day and night, as on the moon) rolling forward on the
                   terrain below, where we now know the Klingons are.
                   Sunlight is being replaced by night with the rolling
                   motion.

                   The POV has been his. He watches in wonder as the day-
                   night line crosses him, in a light change. He stands,
                   turns, and looks behind him to see:

                   The highest plateau is turned into night to complete the
                   cycle. We now see this area for the first time as the
                   starlight begins to fill it. A rocky, craggy place
                   with giant tree roots and gnarled shapes everywhere.

                   Saavik is ministering to the O.S. boy. We do not yet
                   see his face. We hear his SOFT SOUNDS, the aftermath
                   of cries which we heard earlier. CAMERA CONTINUES
                   MOVING as Saavik takes off her tunic and throws it as
                   an added cover on the O.S. figure. Then she stops,
                   looks at the boy in wonder, as CAMERA completes its arc
                   to reveal the BOY.

                   We are shocked to see the Boy has changed. He is now
                   unquestionably older, perhaps 13 or 14. He is breath-
                   ing heavily as the pain recedes.

             151   EXT. PROMONTORY - CLOSE - SAAVIK                           151

                   She has fallen asleep in her exhaustion. There is a
                   faint SOUND OF TRICORDER LIFE SIGNS BEEPING. She slum-
                   bers through this. Then, the planet begins to tremble.
                   A RUMBLE. An O.S. CRY, which by now we know is from
                   the young Spock. Saavvik shakes herself, wakes up not
                   knowing what has just happened. The first thing she is
                   aware of is the BEEPING TRICORDER. She checks it,
                   uncertain. Then pulls her communicator.

                                           SAAVIK
                             David... This is Saavik... Come
                             in.

                   There is STATIC, and no response. Then the planet
                   trembles again, and there is a definite O.S. CRY.
                   Saavik reacts in alarm, hurries OUT OF SCENE as the
                   RUMBLING and the CRIES CONTINUE.

             152   INT. ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE - NIGHT                          152

                   As Saavik appears in the opening.

                   We hear the O.S. CRIES OF PAIN from the boy as Saavik
                   watches, sympathetic but helpless. As the CRIES
                   SUBSIDE, and there are no more rumblings, Saavik takes
                   a few steps inside. She sees:

             153   HER POV - THE YOUNG MAN                                    153

                   Hunched down in a corner, his face turned AWAY FROM USS,
                   is Spock. He is now in some kind of awful spasm.

             154   BACK TO SAAVIK                                             154

                   She studies what she sees. She understands. His CRY
                   OF RAGE now splits the air and:

             155   THE YOUNG SPOCK                                            155

                   He turns TO CAMERA suddenly, a YOUNG MAN in his late
                   teens, lean of face, high of cheekbone. The look on
                   this tortured face and his body language tell us he is
                   fighting for control of body and his world. He is
                   fevered and shuddering. He looks at Saavik with wild
                   eyes which are both frightened -- and frightening.

             156   SAAVIK                                                     156

                   She approaches him cautiously, but with absolute under-
                   standing. She stops a step away from him.

                                           SAAVIK
                             So it has come.

                   Spock hears, but does not understand.

                                           SAAVIK
                                     (continuing)
                             It is called Pon Farr.

                   He stares.

                                           SAAVIK
                                     (continuing)
                             Pon Farr. 

                   Her voice has calmed him some. She takes the last step
                   and is now close to him. Calmly and in Vulcan:

                                           SAAVIK
                                     (continuing)
                             (... Will you trust me...?)

                   Spock does not respond; he is in quiet agony. She
                   kneels beside him. His breathing is labored... Saavik
                   offers her hand in Pon Farr configuration -- like a
                   two-finger Boy Scout salute. Spock studies it, then
                   she brings up his right hand in the same configuration.

                   With her two extended fingers she touches his and then
                   slowly begins to stroke his entire hand in gentle fore-
                   play. His breathing eases now, his body begins to
                   relax. Uncertainly, he begins to return the finger-
                   play, first on Saavik's hand and then on her temples.

                   He is more in control now... intense. His eyes turn
                   and lock on hers. Hands touching, they move together
                   until their faces are brushing... and their fingers
                   embrace.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   breathes calmly. A hand, Saavik's, ENTERS SHOT, to

                   A softer look than we have seen before. But a look of
                   concern and apprehension.

                   She sighs, then picks up communicator. She is about to
                   transmit a message when an instinct makes her put it
                   down, turn to the cave entrance. We PAN with her look

                   the Bird of Prey in separate explosions --

                   The displacement of the explosions cause the Klingon
                   ship to turn and be pushed back, as if by thrusters --

                             Vulcan scientist of your

                             He is subject to rapid aging --
                             like this unstable planet.

                   The Sergeant has had enough with her long windedness,
                   pulls the communicator and thrusts it in front of
                   David.

                   The Sergeant has received the order. He draws a dis-
                   tinctive Klingon dagger, frightening to behold. As
                   KIRK'S VOICE is heard, INDISTINCTLY PROTESTING over the
                   communicator, the Sergeant walks behind the assembled
                   line of the three prisoners: the Vulcan youth, Saavik,
                   and David. It is like a game of Russian Roulette.

                   We do not know where the blow will fall. Then, the
                   Sergeant has picked his victim, and raises his dagger
                   back to strike --

                   It is Saavik he intends to kill. David, his face
                   curled in rage, leaps forward. grabs the man's arm.
                   The struggle is short.

                   David takes a knife in the chest.

                             energizing transporter beam... Now.

                   As the ELECTRONIC WIND UP begins...

                   As the POWER WHINE INCREASES, Kirk steps on one of the
                   transporter pods, joining Scotty, McCoy, Sulu and
                   Chekov. After a few endless seconds, they begin to
                   DE-MATERIALIZE AND VANISH. There is a FLICKER, a
                   pause. Are they returning? Have they been blocked?

                   No. The second BEAM EFFECT materializes the Klingon
                   landing party. They pause guardedly, phasers drawn.
                   Then, led by Torg, they start out. We are faintly
                   aware of a soft COMPUTER VOICE counting off seconds.

                   Kruge waits, patiently...

                   The Klingon landing party enters, proceeds cautiously...

             210   INT. BRIDGE - ENTERPRISE (INTERCUT WITH KRUGE)             210

                   It is deserted except for the soft COMPUTER VOICE.

                             Twenty-two... twenty-one...
                             twenty...

                   The sliding door opens and Torg leads the Klingons in,
                   weapons drawn. They check out the bridge as the VOICE
                   CONTINUES FAINTLY, unobserved by the Klingons. Then
                   Torg pulls out his communicator.

                                           TORG
                             My Lord. The ship appears to be
                             deserted.

                                           KRUGE'S VOICE
                             How can this be? They are hiding!

                                           TORG
                             Yes, sir. But the bridge appears
                             to be run by computer. It is the
                             only thing speaking.

                                           KRUGE'S VOICE
                             Speaking? Let me hear...

                   Torg, puts his communicator close to the computer's
                   panel speaker and the voice is quite loud now.

                                           COMPUTER (V.O.)

                             out!

                   Torg and his men are baffled by Kruge's distress when a
                   sudden SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS engulf the bridge, and --

                   The skin of the circular section ruptures, cracks open
                   like an arid desert; the star drive section bursts and
                   trembles... (ILM)

                   Kruge watching in frustrated rage...

                   Like a fiery comet, Enterprise falls gracefully out of

                   Saavik; the young Vulcan, watching. She, uncertain.
                   He, staring blankly...

                   We see Enterprise in the distance, a small fireball in
                   the outer edge of the Genesis atmosphere. (ILM)

                   The comet-like death of Enterprise in the distance is
                   being watched by a silhouetted group as the sun sets.

                   The five survivors of Enterprise, temporarily safe,
                   watch in awe and grief as their home of twenty years
                   dies in the ominous sky beyond. On each face, the
                   light left by Enterprise flickers, then at last, is
                   gone. Kirk watches with hollowed eyes.

                                           KIRK
                             My god, Bones. What have I done?

                                           McCOY
                             What you had to do. What you
                             always do. Turned death into a
                             fighting chance to live.

                             You hear me, Jim?

                   Kirk takes a deep breath, nods his understanding to
                   McCoy. Even as the earth trembles, and Sulu's tri-
                   corder begins to go a little wild.

                                           SULU

                             Come on!

                   They hurry off in the direction Sulu has pointed, as
                   the GROWLS AND RUMBLES of the planet begin to
                   accelerate. Night is falling.

                   He is watching something O.S. with apprehension. WIDEN
                   to reveal Kruge in f.g. going through his own crisis,
                   an agony of self-loathing. After a moment...

                             the one thing I didn't anticipate
                             ... He destroyed himself...

                             Killing his son was stupid! It
                             made Kirk willing to die.
 
                                           MALTZ

                             They are useless! It was Kirk I
                             needed. And I let him slip away.

                                           MALTZ
                             But surely, our mission has not
                             failed -- ?

                             Our mission is over. I have
                             failed... A human has been bolder

                   As Maltz watches him uncertainly...

             215   EXT. THE KLINGON CAMP - NIGHT                              215

                   The two Klingons guard the seated Saavik. Spock is
                   isolated, some distance away. The death RUMBLINGS of
                   the planet begin to INCREASE with each moment. The sky
                   beyond occasionally lights with awesome flashes of
                   electrical energy; the ground shakes in unpredictable
                   spurts. Suddenly, a tree vaults upward, as if pushed
                   from its place by a force below. The TREE GROANS AN
                   CRASHES toward the ground, the Klingons leaping out of
                   its way.

             216   FAVORING  SAAVIK                                           216

                   As the two Klingons are distracted, and the planet's
                   agony continues, Saavik slips away from them toward
                   Spock.

             217   SPOCK                                                      217

                   He is seated, BACK TO US. His aging spasms has begun,
                   and with each earth RUMBLE of the planet, he suffers.

             218   THE KLINGONS                                               218

                   concerned about their own problems, and the silence
                   from their ship. The Sergeant pulls his communicator.

                                           SERGEANT
                             (Lord Commander... This place is

                             ourselves and the prisoners...)

                   While he waits for an answer, his eyes catches Saavik's
                   progress toward Spock. He calls this to his subordi-
                   nate's attention with a guttural grunt, and the second
                   Klingon hurries off to correct the situation.

                   As she nears the suffering Vulcan, the Klingon reaches
                   her, and with a strong arm, hurls her easily aside.
                   The GROUND RUMBLES again. The Vulcan cries out. THE
                   Klingon, fascinated by the Vulcan's behavior,
                   approaches, then, reaches out toward him.

                                           SAAVIK
                             No, don't touch him!

                   The Klingon ignores. He puts his hand on the Vulcan,
                   and for his trouble, in a blur of action, gets grabbed,
                   whacked, and hurled through the air by a burst of the
                   Vulcan's strength.

                   The Klingon lands at the base of the gnarled tree and
                   lies quite still, his neck broken.

                   reacts in shock to what has happened, draws his phaser,
                   all business now as he studies:

                   Hands over his face as he twists in pain. He emits a
                   long, terrible CRY, the cry we've heard, but never
                   seen.

             222   EXT. GROTESQUE FOREST - FAST TRUCKING SHOT                 222

                   Kirk and the crew are coming to the rescue, running
                   amid the TREMORS and the flashes of light, whipped by
                   wind and flailing trees. As the CRY is heard THROUGH
                   THE WIND, they pull up, listening. The CRY AGAIN,
                   close by. Kirk leads them out on the run.

             223   THE KLINGON CAMP - SERIES OF SHOTS                         223

                   Saavik has returned to try to help Spock. She holds
                   him now, as his spasms continue.

                   The Sergeant comes forward, phaser in hand, until he
                   reaches the Vulcan, held by Saavik. The Klingon stops,
                   mesmerized. He stares at:

             224   YOUNG SPOCK - OVER SAAVIK'S SHOULDER - (SPECIAL FX)        224

                   His features are changing before our eyes, his face
                   distending...

                   Saavik, looking back at the Klingon, clutches the ago-
                   nized Spock to her, trying in some way to protect him.

             225   THE SERGEANT                                               225

                   He's frightened. He reflexively raises his phaser...

                   and the crew. Kirk, phaser leveled --

                   The Klingon whirls to face the new threat, whips his
                   phaser toward Kirk --

                   But Kirk FIRES A STUN BLAST...

             227   ANGLE - INCLUDING THE KLINGON - (STUNT & ILM)              227

                   The STUN WAVES zip at the Klingon, strike him with
                   spectacular force, cause him to somersault through the
                   air, and then, landing, lie still.

                   Kirk lowers his phaser; he and the others stare at:

                   Saavik, holding the now immobile Spock.

                   The Enterprise family reacts; with Kirk and Bones lead-
                   ing, they rush to Saavik.

             229   ANGLE AT SPOCK AND SAAVIK                                  229

                   Kirk and the others have pulled up. Spock is now coma-
                   tose, breathing with labored sighs. We cannot see his
                   face, cradled in Saavik's comforting embrace. But Saavik 
                   is looking up at Kirk with dazed eyes.

                             ... Bones...

                   McCoy crosses quickly, takes the Vulcan's form from
                   Saavik as she rises to Kirk.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Oh, Admiral.

                   Even a half-Vulcan has a breaking point. She sags for
                   just a moment.

                                           KIRK
                             Easy, Saavik. It's all right.

                   As he holds Saavik, his eyes flick over her shoulder
                   to:

                   Unnoticed up to now, half covered by leaves, the body
                   of David, Kirk's fallen son.

                   He reacts. Then, with a last comforting hug to Saavik,
                   he breaks the embrace, and heads slowly for David's
                   body. She watches him EXIT SHOT.

                   WIDEN to admit Kirk as he enters, kneels. He reaches
                   out, touches hiss son's brow, wipes a leaf away.

                   Saavik has come up behind him. She hangs back. Then
                   Kirk rises, aware of her presence.

                   With the crew gathered around, McCoy is scanning the
                   Vulcan's body, soothing his fevered brow. We cannot
                   see Spock's face, but Kirk ass he enters and kneels
                   beside McCoy. He reacts, mesmerized by what he sees:

                   There is a lightning FLASH, and an earth TREMOR -- and
                   a moan from Spock. Kirk responds, rises, and crosses

                   As he moves, stops, wrestling with the urgency of what
                   must be done. Then, deciding, he whips out his

                   A lightning flash makes him cover his eyes... Then:

                   More STATIC. Kirk's ploy has apparently failed. He
                   sags a bit, starts back toward the crew, when another
                   series of flashes blind them all as the planet rumbles
                   with sound and fury and Spock moans. Then, Kirk and
                   crew do not see what to do:

                   In the near distance, amid the flashings, a figure is
                   revealed, lost in the confusion. It is Kruge, phaser
                   in hand.

                   hands in the air. Kruge moves closer, pointing.

                   Suddenly, the very ground on which he stands seems to
                   become an elevator. He is carried rapidly upward on a
                   craggy rock formation which bursts upward, out of the
                   ground. Kruge tumbles, and Kirk seizes the opportunity --

             240   THE FIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS                                240

                   Kirk leaps upon Kruge and they roll and struggle on the
                   churning, erupting ground.

                   They are evenly matched. Kirk's opening momentum holds
                   until Kruge's great size begins to turn the tide. He
                   takes temporary command with swift vicious kicks and
                   punches. Kirk is down.

                   Kruge now looks around for his phase, starts for it,
                   but Kirk, in a series of ground rolls trips Kruge up
                   with his legs, and comes on.

                   The off-balance Kruge now takes a series of punches
                   from Kirk which make him reel backward near the edge of
                   the promontory. A final blow from Kirk forces Kruge
                   over the edge -- and he:

                   -- tumbles and rolls down the fifteen foot slope. Kirk
                   peers over the edge to see:

                   Kruge has landed on a level precipice about fifteen
                   feet in diameter. Beyond that is an endless drop into
                   a chasm, the bottom of which has become a glowing red
                   river of LAVA.

                   As Kruge rises to his feet, Kirk without hesitation
                   soars into the air from above and dives upon Kruge, the
                   momentum of the dive taking both men right to the edge
                   of the final drop. They work their way to their feet
                   and continue the struggle anew, pieces of the rock edge
                   slipping away under their feet as they scuffle. Kirk
                   is winning until:

                   With a burst of energy, Kruge shoves Kirk hard and Kirk
                   slams into a wall of stone, dazed. Kruge has him --
                   but as he starts to step forward, the edge of the rock he
                   is standing on starts to slip.

                   Kirk on the left against the wall, Kruge on the right,
                   on the edge. Kruge is dropping lower. The rock forma-
                   tion he is on now breaks away, carrying him outward:

                   Kruge does jump forward at the last possible instant as
                   the rock falls away. He leaps to:

                   Where Kruge lands precariously, hanging on almost by
                   his fingernails. He's holding on as best as he can, his
                   legs flailing, unable to gain any purchase to boost him
                   up.

                   Kirk, recovering his own strength, sees Kruge in this
                   helpless situation. He comes forward to the edge,
                   kneels over the Klingon.

                                           KIRK
                             Give me your hand and we both
                             live.

                                           KRUGE
                                     (screams a curse in Klingon)

                                           KIRK
                             Don't be a fool -- give me your
                             hand!

                   Kruge looks down, measuring the terror below as if
                   considering, then with sudden and explosive strength,
                   vaults upward making a desperate grab for Kirk. He has
                   a leg! Suddenly, Kirk is fighting not to be pulled
                   over the edge. He is losing that fight. Till he
                   lashes out with a blow. The Klingon's grip slips, yet
                   he hangs on tenaciously, until -- with a cry of rage --

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                             I have had... enough... of you!!

                   Kirk turns and kicks Kruge mightily -- and the Klingon
                   begins his fall...

             245   WIDE DOWN ANGLED SHOT - (ILM ELEMENTS)                     245

                   Kirk in f.g. watches as Kruge tumbles endlessly toward
                   the steaming red hot lava beds below...

             246   ON KIRK                                                    246

                   He turns now to his ultimate problem: the planet is
                   caving in around him. He starts to scramble up the
                   steep slope, back to the promontory where --

             247   THE PROMONTORY - SPOCK                                     247

                   His inert body lies, surrounded by new bursts of steam
                   from the cracking earth...

             248   ANGLE - KIRK (ILM ELEMENT)                                 248

                   Behind him we see the first signs of a fast rising
                   fireball sun. He claws his way back to the top level
                   and races to Spock's fallen form. He kneels and turns
                   the body over to see:

             249   PAST KIRK TO SPOCK                                         249

                   We see the face at last: it is Spock, at the age he
                   died.

                   But he is also a haggard, ravaged shell of a being,
                   almost again dead from the agonies of change -- and
                   even now, with soft frightening sounds, giving
                   indications of the final changes that lie just ahead.

             250   KIRK - SUN LARGER BEHIND HIM (ILM ELEMENTS)                250

                   Amid the death knell of this place, Kirk knows it is
                   now or never. A desperate idea forms. With
                   determination, he picks Spock up and shoulders him.
                   Then drawing his communicator, he flips it open and
                   takes his best shot:

                                           KIRK
                                     (in guttural Klingon)
                              (Maltz... Activate beam!...)

                   There is a moment of uncertainty. Kirk is about to try
                   again when the Klingon beam SOUND begins and...

             251   BEAM UP EFFECT - (ILM ELEMENTS)                            251

                   Amid the groans, flashes, the HISSES OF STEAM and
                   falling debris, Kirk, carrying Spock dematerializes in
                   the KLINGON BEAM, even as the sun appears to be coming
                   closer...

             252   MASTER - THE DESERTED PLANET (ILM SHOT)                    252

                   ... and closer still, casting yellow white light over
                   the disintegrating surface...

                   The doors WHOOSH open, and Kirk, carrying the inert
                   Spock, steps out, phaser at the ready!

                   Maltz on the Captain's deck, the Enterprise prisoners
                   below. Maltz turns, expecting Kruge, and is clearly
                   astonished; as he raises his hands, Kirk steps forward.

                                           KIRK
                             How many more?

                                           SCOTTY
                             Just him, sir!

                             find a station!

                   A flurry of activity as the crew moves into position in
                   the strange -- yet familiar bridge. McCoy takes Spock
                   from Kirk, guides him OUT OF SCENE, and Saavik takes
                   Maltz' phaser and steps back. To Maltz:

                                     (continuing)

                                           MALTZ
                             I do not deserve to live!

                             get out of here!

                   And so saying, he dashes OUT OF SHOT, followed by
                   Saavik. The Klingon can only stare in confusion.

                   out. Beyond, her sun waits, former friend, now ready
                   to accept the planet in death.

                   Kirk in command, Sulu and Saavik on nearby station.
                   They are confronted by familiar tools, but baffling
                   zymology.

                   Scotty hunched over the console, Chekov hunched over
                   him...

                   Scotty makes several adjustments, presses some buttons,
                   then, with a deep breath, moves a sliding handle for-
                   ward. A HIGH WHINE STARTS, WAVERS, THEN GROWS ROBUST.

                   The planet is now heading toward the sun. We watch
                   in wonder as she gains speed and becomes a glazing

                   As he starts to:

                             I lied.

                   At Kirk's gesture, Chekov leads Maltz out. Kirk turns
                   back to his panel.

                   Saavik raises an eyebrow.

                             Or less. What you describe is called
                             Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is
                             very dangerous. The elders may not
                             choose to attempt it.

                             . He will remain always as he
                             is.

                   As Kirk wrestles with the horror of this we see:

                   He is pale, comatose, fragile looking. WIDEN as Bones
                   passes a scanner over the form; the scanner's sound is
                   feeble. McCoy stops in frustration, checks Spock's
                   eyes; then turns back, wearily. Softly, as CAMERA
                   begins to ARC around them.

                             struck me with it, for God's sake,

                                     (a pause, then)
                             I never thought I'd say this
                             to you. but it seems I've missed you.
                             And I couldn't bear to lose you again.

                   He lowers his head in helpless grief on the form of the
                   unmoving Spock, and CAMERA'S ARC has revealed Kirk
                   standing, watching. Kirk steps forward now, puts his
                   hand gently on McCoy, then on Spock. Three lives,
                   intertwined for so long.

                   the Bird of Prey ENTERS SHOT, heading toward Vulcan.

                   As energizers wind down, Kirk hits comm:

                             Bones, let's get him off-loaded.

                   as a RAMP section of the plane HISSES and lowers to the
                   ground. Spock is carried down on a litter borne by his
                   friends. As they reach the bottom, Kirk is in f.g.,
                   and looks in amazement to see:

             272   POV - (ILM ELEMENTS)                                       272

                   The great hill to the Temple is lined with hundreds of
                   Vulcans, many with torches. It is most impressive.

             273   BACK TO KIRK - McCOY - SAAVIK                              273

                             Much is at stake...

                   Then Kirk sees something else, reacts as:

             274   UHURA                                                      274

                   Crosses to the crew -- is hugged by Kirk. Her eyes are
                   moist with emotion as:

                                           UHURA
                             Sarek is waiting above...

                   Kirk nods, and Uhura falls in place behind him, helping
                   to carry Spock's form with the others. They now carry
                   Spock OUT OF SCENE as we begin to hear RITUAL CHANTS
                   and MUSIC in the distance.

                   DISSOLVE TO:

             275   EXT. VULCAN HILL - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT                 275

                   The procession is in progress through a path lined on
                   both sides by simply-robed Vulcans of all ages.
                   Spock's form makes passage to stately MUSIC.

             276   VARIOUS SHOTS                                              276

                   Vulcans responding to Spock's passage.

                   FEATURE: A small girl releases herself from her
                   father's grip and moves alongside the body, makes the
                   Vulcan salute, and whispers with great solemnity:

                                           SMALL GIRL
                             ... Live long and prosper, Spock...

                   REACTION CUTS from Kirk and the others. And we --

                   DISSOLVE TO:

             277   EXT. VULCAN - UPPER LEVEL OF TEMPLE AREA - SERIES OF       277
                   SHOTS

                   Sarek, some DIGNITARIES, and SIX VULCAN WOMEN, tall and
                   stately, are waiting. MUSICIANS are close by now. As
                   the Enterprise group reaches Sarek, he steps forward to
                   meet them. Now a silence falls.

                   Sarek stands at his son's head and gently places his
                   two hands on Spock's face. When he is done, he looks
                   at Kirk and McCoy. They search his face for some
                   indication of hope, but Sarek is expressionless. He
                   steps back now, gestures. The Vulcan women come
                   forward, and take Spock from his friends.

                   As the transfer is completed, the procession begins
                   again toward the temple entry. Sarek falls in behind
                   the body; Kirk and his group follow him.

                   DISSOLVE TO:

             278   INT. VULCAN TEMPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       278

                   The Hall of Ancient Thought, lined with massive heads
                   of stone. DOLLY with the procession as an amazing
                   thing takes place:

                   As Spock's body moves, now seen -- now blocked by
                   passing forms, we realize the bearers' hands are
                   no longer under the body, but are ON TOP OF IT.

                   The magic of this moment is not lost on Kirk, Bones and
                   the others as we --
 
                   DISSOLVE TO:

             279   EXT. VULCAN ALTAR AREA - SERIES OF SHOTS (ILM ELEMENTS)    279

                   A great saucer-shaped platform under the Vulcan sky,
                   with an altar at the far end. The dramatic figure of a
                   VULCAN PRIESTESS stands there. Rising into the air
                   behind her is an elegant version of the Vulcan hand
                   salute shaped in gleaming metal.

                   The bearers continue with Spock toward the altar, but
                   Sarek stops here on the threshold, and stops Kirk and
                   group.

                                           SAREK
                             This is where you will wait.

                   Sarek turns to face the altar. Spock's body is
                   deposited there to ritual MUSIC. Then, the powerful
                   CHANT of the HIGH PRIESTESS begins.

                   Kirk and McCoy and the others stare in awe at what is
                   happening, as the Priestess' chant flows over them.
                   Then, the CHANT ENDS. Sarek steps forward. A HORN..
                   ..SOUNDS. Then:

                                           PRIESTESS
                             Sarek... Child of Skon... Child of
                             Solkar. The body of your son
                             breathes still. What is your
                             wish?

                                           SAREK
                             I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan, the
                             refusion.

                                           PRIESTESS
                             What you seek has not been done
                             since ages past -- and then, only
                             in legend. Your request is not
                             logical.
                                 
                                           SAREK
                             Forgive me, T'Lar. My logic
                             falters where my son is
                             concerned.

                   She looks at him for a long moment. Then:

                                           PRIESTESS
                             Who is the Keeper of the Katra?

                   As Sarek's nod and Kirk's urgent look, Bones replies
                   uncertainly:

                                           McCOY
                             I am... McCOY... Leonard H.
                                     (adding)
                             Son of David...

                                           PRIESTESS
                                     (deep, ominous)
                             McCoy... Son of David. Since
                             thou art human, we cannot expect
                             thee to understand fully what
                             Sarek has requested. The
                             circumstances are extraordinary:
                             Spock's body lives... With your
                             approval, we shall use all our
                             powers to return to his body that
                             which you possess: his essence.
                             But McCoy...
                                     (a pause)
                             You must now be warned! the
                             danger to thyself is as grave as
                             the danger to Spock.
                                     (this impacts on
                                      McCoy and Kirk)
                             You must make the choice.

                                           McCOY
                                     (pause, then...)
                             I choose the danger.
                                     (then, aside to
                                      Kirk)
                             Helluva time to ask.

                                           PRIESTESS
                             Bring him forward.

                   As Sarek leads Bones toward the altar, we HOLD on
                   Kirk's new apprehension.

                   SHOTS

                   Sarek and McCoy reach the altar, and Sarek departs.
                   The Priestess intones another short CHANT, punctuated
                   by GONGS and MUSICAL emphatics. Then chant and music
                   stop and we hear only the gentle SOUND OF THE WIND, and
                   far-off TEMPLE CHIMES. She places a hand on Bones'
                   face, another on Spock's. Then, eerily:

                                           PRIESTESS
                             All that can be done... shall be
                             done... Though it take full turn
                             of the Vulcan sun...

                   SOFT MUSIC now. She begins drifting into a trance like
                   mind meld, chanting softly, almost inaudibly.

                   CLOSE on McCoy... And Spock... Their eyes are closed.
                   A sense of kinetic energy somehow passing between
                   them...

                   The early morning sun casts a different, long-shadowed
                   hot look on the altar and threshold.

                   From where they had watched from last night, here they have
                   waited, lain down. They are beginning to stir when the
                   SOUND OF A GONG brings them fully awake. They rise,
                   bleary eyed to see:

                   the altar area on a sedan chair. As she leaves, Sarek,
                   supporting a weary McCoy, heads a procession of hooded
                   robed priests. Among them we now see a HOODED ROBED
                   FIGURE all in WHITE.

                   The procession is passing Kirk's party, while Kirk and
                   the crew can only stare in uncertainty. Then, Sarek
                   signals the others to continue while he, with McCoy,
                   breaks off and comes to Kirk.

             286   KIRK AND CREW                                              286

                   They wait now as Bones, leaning on Sarek, ENTERS SHOT.

                                           KIRK
                             Bones...?

                                           McCOY
                             All right... I'm all right, Jim.

                   Sulu and Scotty reach for him, help support him. He is
                   weakened, but otherwise all right. Kirk gestures
                   toward the white-robed figure walking slowly away.
 
                                           KIRK
                             What about Spock?

                                           SAREK
                             I am not sure. Only time will
                             answer.
                                     (then)
                             Kirk. I thank you. What you have 
                             done is --

                                           KIRK
                             What I have done, I had to do.

                                           SAREK
                             But at what cost? Your ship...
                             Your son.

                                           KIRK
                             If I hadn't tried, the cost would
                             have been my soul.
 
                   Sarek looks at him with deep admiration, then turns
                   and heads back to the group of priests. The wind
                   blows, and --

             287   KIRK AND GROUP                                             287

                   They are now looking into the low sun, shading their
                   eyes for a last look at the white-robed figure.

             288   POV - SAREK AND GROUP - LONG LENS                          288

                   They are moving slowly away when, suddenly, the white-
                   robed figure stops, turns toward the Enterprise group.

             289   CLOSE - THE WHITE HOOD                                     289

                   We cannot see the features beneath, but we know the
                   figure is staring. After a moment, the figure starts
                   back to the Enterprise group. As two priests reach to
                   stop him, they are stayed by Sarek, who now watches
                   with interest.

             290   KIRK AND GROUP                                             290

                   watching with held breath as the white-robed figure
                   walks steadily to them, reaches them.

             291   THE FIGURE                                                 291

                   Back lit. The wind whips his garment. Now he lowers
                   his hood. We see Spock: a radiant, gentled Spock.
                   His age is as we have known it; his hair, his face, the
                   same; he would look at peace except for the eyes, which
                   remain hollow, filled with questions and uncertainties.

             292   SCENE - VARIOUS ANGLES                                     292

                   The Enterprise crew, each of them stares back at Spock
                   as SUBJECTIVE CAMERA PANS PAST them SLOWLY. Each makes his
                   own effort to be remembered, but --

                   Spock remains churning, but uncertain. Then he looks
                   hardest at all at:

                   Kirk. The wind whips his hair.

                   Something triggers in Spock. He steps forward, and
                   then in an odd, rusty voice:

                                           SPOCK
                             I know you... Do I not?

                                           KIRK
                             Yes. And I know you.

                                           SPOCK
                             My father says you have been my
                             friend... You came back for me.

                                           KIRK
                             You would have done the same for
                             me.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (searching)
                             Why would you do this...?

                                           KIRK
                                     (grasping to make
                                      a connection)
                             Because... the needs of the one
                             outweighed the needs of the many.

                   Spock stares at him. A vague connection has been made
                   -- but not enough. Spock turns away in uncertainty,
                   begins walking back to the group he left. Kirk raises
                   his helpless hand after Spock, wondering what he might
                   have said, should have said -- when suddenly:

                   Spock stops, back to Kirk. He closes his eyes, looks
                   to the sky. And like someone who has found a piece of
                   a puzzle, he says:

                                           SPOCK
                             I have been... and ever shall
                             be... your friend.

                   Kirk steps forward a few steps -- hushed, encouraging --

                                           KIRK
                             Yes, yes, Spock...

                                           SPOCK
                                     (half turns)
                             The ship... Out of danger...?

                                           KIRK
                                     (deeply)
                             You saved the ship, Spock. You
                             saved us all. Don't you remember?!

                   There is an odd moment after Kirk's impassioned speech:
                   Spock cocks his head as if some vital piece of informa-
                   tion had just clicked into place.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (softly)
                             ... Jim... Your name is Jim.

                   Kirk's eyes well with tears. He nods his head.

                                           KIRK
                             ... Yes.

                   Their eyes are locked together. Spock gives a little
                   nod of satisfaction, as if knowing he has taken the
                   first of many steps. He turns to share this with
                   McCoy... And then with them all. We have the feeling
                   that Spock has come back to his family... and to us...

             293   ON ENTERPRISE FAMILY                                       293

                   They have gathered round Kirk now, beaming at Spock
                   through their tears and their joy, knowing they all
                   have a future together. As the CAMERA PULLS UP AND
                   BACK from this, we ROLL END CREDITS and --

                   FADE OUT.

                                           THE END
