	FADE IN:

1    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	SISKO is seated at his desk studying a PADD when KIRA 
	ENTERS...

					KIRA
				(somewhat frazzled)
			You wanted to see me, Commander?

					SISKO
				(non-accusatory)
			Actually, what I'd like to see is 
			next month's duty roster...

					KIRA
				(holds hands up; in 
				control)
			You'll have it on your desk first 
			thing in the morning...

					SISKO
			That's what you said yesterday.

					KIRA
			I know, but I spent all day 
			yesterday...

					SISKO
				(finishing her sentence)
			... talking to Minister Rozahn about 
			irrigating the Trilar Peninsula.

					KIRA
				(genuinely surprised)
			How did you know?

					SISKO
				(smiles)
			Major, it's hard to keep a secret in 
			Ops... especially when you've been 
			shouting at a monitor for the last 
			two days...

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER             2.

1    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(slightly embarrassed)
			I thought I was keeping it to an 
			angry whisper...

					SISKO
			Let's just say your voice carries.

					KIRA
			Everytime I talk to one of the 
			ministers I promise myself I won't 
			lose control.  But then they give me 
			some stupid bureaucratic excuse why 
			something isn't getting done, and I 
			get so... so...

					SISKO
				(completing her 
				sentence)
			Frustrated.

					KIRA
			Commander, I'm way beyond 
			frustrated... Bajor's in trouble...
				(simply)
			I just want to help.

					SISKO
			I can understand that, and I 
			sympathize.  As far as I'm concerned 
			you can yell at the provisional 
			government all you want... as long 
			as it doesn't interfere with your 
			duties here on the station.

					KIRA
			You're right.  I'll get on that report 
			right away.

					SISKO
			I'll look forward to reading it.

1A   INT. OPS

	O'BRIEN at his station, supernumeraries as needed.  Kira 
	comes out of the Commander's Office.

					O'BRIEN
			Quark's been looking for you... he 
			says it's urgent...

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER            2A.

1A     CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(sarcastically)
			Perfect.

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER             3.

2    INT. QUARK'S

	The ususal crowd is in attendance, though they're not behaving 
	in the usual way.  A respectful silence fills the room as 
	both customers and employees listen to an aged Bajoran 
	(VARANI) playing a strange, woodwind instrument.  The 
	soothing, almost sad SOUNDS coming from the instrument have 
	put everyone into a dreamy, reflective state... everyone, 
	that is, except QUARK.  From behind the bar, Quark loads a 
	tray with drinks, then finds his SERVER ignoring him, 
	captivated instead by the evocative "music."  Quark has to 
	CLEAR HIS THROAT LOUDLY to get the server's attention.  He 
	hastily picks up the tray and moves off.

	Quark turns to MORN, who's sitting at the bar, also hypnotized 
	by Varani's playing.  Morn reaches up and wipes a tear away 
	from the corner of his eye.  Quark leans over and glares at 
	him... he can't believe it... Morn's tear is the final straw!  
	Quark comes out from behind the bar and starts to beeline 
	toward Varani when Kira appears, grabs him by the arm, and 
	swings him back to the bar...

					KIRA
			I hear you've been trying to get in 
			touch with me...

					QUARK
				(upset)
			You hear right.  Look around you... 
			does anything seem to be amiss?

					KIRA
				(takes in the crowd 
				and Varani)
			That sonata Varani is playing is 
			lovely... your customers seem to be 
			enjoying him...

					QUARK
			Why be modest, Major?  They're not 
			just enjoying him -- they're 
			mesmerized by him!

					KIRA
			So?

					QUARK
			So!  While they're being mesmerized, 
			they're not gambling, they're not 
			eating, they're barely drinking.  
			Profits are down across the board!

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER             4.

2    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(disbelieving)
			He just started yesterday...

					QUARK
			I monitor my gross income hourly.  
			My hourly figures become my 
			indicators.  My indicators become my 
			projections.  And my projections 
			based on the last twenty-six hours 
			show an unprecedented decline in 
			profits.

					KIRA
			Stop overreacting.  When people hear 
			about how wonderful Varani is, they'll 
			come beating down your door...

					QUARK
			And what are you basing that 
			projection on?  Bajoran intuition?  
			That and a strip of latinum will get 
			you a couple of spins at the dabo 
			wheel.

					KIRA
			You promised me you'd try him out 
			for a month...

					QUARK
			If my projections hold true, in a 
			month I'll be out of business!

					KIRA
				(firmly, no nonsense)
			Quark, you're going to do this...

					QUARK
			Why should I?

					KIRA
				(voice like steel)
			Because I asked you to.

	Quark eyes her, realizes she means business.  He turns to 
	Varani, still pained at the projected decline in profits, 
	but realizing he's stuck.

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER             5.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
			Maybe he could play something with a 
			little more... bounce to it...

					KIRA
			Bounce...

					QUARK
			Just for a change of pace...

	She eyes him, then walks toward Varani... stay on Quark... 
	he sighs...

3    ANGLE

	as he finishes playing.  Applause.  Kira respectfully 
	approaches.

					KIRA
			That was beautiful...

					VARANI
				(smiles warmly)
			Having my work appreciated again... 
			I almost forgot how it felt.

					KIRA
			Granted, it's not quite the exhibition 
			halls you're used to...

					VARANI
				(a plaintive smile)
			One can't be choosy about performance 
			venues these days.

					KIRA
			I just spoke to Quark.  He likes 
			what you're doing... but he's hoping 
			you'll play a variety of styles...

					VARANI
				(slyly understanding)
			A little less exhibition hall and a 
			little more music hall... is that 
			it?

					KIRA
			Something like that.

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER            5A.

3    CONTINUED:

					VARANI
				(good-naturedly)
			I think I can accommodate him.

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER             6.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

	Kira smiles... we HEAR the noise from the bar, the raucous 
	cries of "DABO!"

					KIRA
			I'd love to hear you play in a more 
			appropriate setting...

					VARANI
				(casually)
			Mahve you spoken to Minister Bolka 
			about my idea to rebuild the Jalanda 
			Forum?

					KIRA
			I mentioned it to him...
				(admitting to Bolka's 
				resistance)
			He's got a lot of things on his 
			mind...

					VARANI
			You must keep trying.  Bajorans must 
			reclaim their artistic heritage if 
			they ever hope to regain their sense 
			of self-worth.

					KIRA
				(guiltly agreeing)
			Next time I talk to the Minister, 
			I'll bring it up again... but I can't 
			promise anything.

					VARANI
			I have faith in you, Kira.  By 
			fighting for this, you're not just a 
			champion of the arts.  You're my 
			champion.

	Kira smiles, but feels the weight of being portrayed as a 
	"champion"...

4    INT. OPS

	Sisko's at the Ops table, O'BRIEN's at his station.  Several 
	male N.D. Supernumeraries are present.  Kira ENTERS from the 
	Turbolift, comes down to Sisko.  (Kira is the only female in 
	Ops at this time.)

					SISKO
			Did you get everything settled with 
			Quark?

             DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - TEASER             7.

					KIRA
			That little toad is this far from 
			doing a three-sixty out an airlock...

					SISKO
			I'm glad to hear everything went 
			okay...

					O'BRIEN
			Commander, sensors are picking up 
			elevated neutrino readings.  A ship's 
			coming through the wormhole...

					SISKO
			On screen.

5    ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The wormhole illuminates... and a ramshackle alien vessel 
	disgorges from its mouth, careening into space.

6    BACK TO SCENE

	Kira turns to the Ops table, calls up information.

					KIRA
			Sensors are detecting four lifeforms 
			on board...

					O'BRIEN
			I'm reading a plasma leak in their 
			engine core...

					SISKO
			Hail them.

					KIRA
				(hitting a panel; 
				beat)
			They're not responding...

					O'BRIEN
			Their reactors are overheating.  
			Life support is barely functioning...

					SISKO
			Get them out of there, Chief.

			Aye, sir.

	O'BRIEN HITS A PANEL AND :

7    ANGLE - TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)

	Four humanoids MATERIALIZE, huddled together in befuddlement 
	and fear... their garb is scruffy, their dark skin an off-
	putting mass of lumps and eczema-like scales.  A teenage 
	male (TUMAK), gripping a wounded hand, is hugged by an older 
	female (HANEEK), while two other males (GAI and COWL) cower 
	in the b.g.

					SISKO
			I'm Commander Sisko of the United 
			Federation of Planets.  You've just 
			been beamed onto a Bajoran space 
			station.  We don't mean you any 
			harm...

8    ON THE NEW ARRIVALS

	refusing to move, their heads swiveling with anxiety and 
	bewilderment... the female, Haneek, seems to get her wits 
	about her first... she looks out at Sisko and the others, 
	fearful, vulnerable, yet almost imploring...

9    ON SISKO AND KIRA

	watching her, wondering...

									FADE OUT.

10   OMITTED

11   INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS - THE FACE-OFF

	between Sisko, Kira and O'Brien on one side and Haneek and 
	her three companions on the other.  Haneek's small group is 
	still clustered and cowering in the Transporter Bay, regarding 
	Sisko and the others warily, like cornered, beaten dogs... 
	(NOTE: Throughout the next sequence, Sisko's attitude and 
	tone will remain patient, nonthreatening and reassuring.)

					SISKO
				(to Haneek)
			We're going to bring your ship in. 
			Once it's docked, we'll be able to 
			diagnose its problems and hopefully 
			fix them.  After that, you can be on 
			your way.

	Haneek looks at Kira, cocks her head gently, as if both 
	puzzled and curious... Kira's not sure what the look means... 
	Sisko cautiously steps toward Haneek and her friends...

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT ONE            10.

11   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(to Tumak, points to 
				Tumak's hand)
			I can offer you medical assistance 
			for that wound...

	Tumak glares at Sisko, begins shouting at him in anger and 
	defiance...

					TUMAK
			Oo-mata!  Oo-mata!  Dongo patar meeoto 
			fenta.  Fenta!

	As Tumak shouts at Sisko, Haneek turns to Kira, steps toward 
	her, begins talking in an urgent, but more reasonable tone, 
	but glancing warily at Sisko...

					HANEEK
			Naga dentana... oobay a-tal.  Oobay 
			a-tal!  Keetama sootay.  Shalanta 
			Skrreea.

					KIRA
				(to Sisko)
			Does anyone understand what she's 
			saying...

					SISKO
			There must be something wrong with 
			the Universal Translator.  Chief?

	O'Brien, hitting a panel, checking his readout...

					O'BRIEN
			It's working, Commander... but for 
			some reason it's having a hard 
			analyzing their language patterns... 
			their syntax and grammatical structure 
			must be completely unlike anything 
			we have in our database...

					SISKO
			We'll have to keep them talking until 
			the computer can establish a 
			translation matrix.

					HANEEK
				(continuing, to Kira)
			Ketoh maseeca.  Skrreea.  Tolak 
			mayfessaka.  Koo masek.  Gadoux

					KIRA
				(in response to Sisko)
			Keeping them talking doesn't seem to

					HANEEK
			Oobay-a-tal?  Fidask setoma meeka?

					SISKO
			Major, we need to get these people 
			to the Infirmary.  They seem to be 
			most comfortable with you.  Why don't 
			you lead the way?

	Kira starts gesturing for Haneek and the others to follow 
	her.

					KIRA
			All right... we're going to go for a 
			little ride in the turbolift...

	Though Haneek doesn't understand her, she appears to trust 
	Kira and motions to her three male companions...

					HANEEK
			Toma.  Bessa!

	They warily step out of the transporter and begin to follow 
	Kira... Sisko follows behind...

					SISKO
				(to com)
			Sisko to Odo.

					ODO'S COM VOICE
			Yes, Commander.

					SISKO
			We're bringing some new arrivals 
			from the Gamma Quadrant down to the 
			Promenade.  Meet us at Turbolift 
			Nine.

					ODO'S COM VOICE
			I'm on my way.

12   INT. PROMENADE

	Odo waits at the Turbolift as the doors open.  Sisko steps 
	out, followed by Kira, who turns back to Haneek and the 
	others.

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT ONE            12.

12   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(gestures)
			We're here... you can come out now...
				(a friendly beckoning 
				wave)
			There's no need to be afraid...

					ODO
			What seems to be the trouble, 
			Commander?

					SISKO
			The computer's having a hard time 
			translating their language...

					ODO
			I can see where that would be a 
			problem...

	The quartet of aliens tentatively exits the Turbolift, Haneek 
	leading... it's like immigrants from Bosnia stepping out 
	among the lights of Broadway... the Promenade is like 
	nothing they've ever seen before... intrigued by their new 
	surroundings, the foursome begins wandering off in all 
	directions...

					ODO
			Hold on now.  Let's stay together.

	He rounds up Gai and Cowl.

					ODO
				(continuing)
			No wandering off --

	They barely pay him any mind, their focus on the Promenade.

					ODO
				(gesturing)
			Just stay put while I round up the 
			others...

					KIRA
			Let me try...

	She taps Gai and Cowl on the shoulder...

					KIRA
				(beckoning)
			Come with me...

	To Odo's surprise, Gai and Cowl follow Kira...

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT ONE            13.

13   ANGLE - CLOTHING/GIFT SHOP

	Haneek and Tumak both look up at a brightly colored, oddly
	designed dress in the window of the shop.  Sisko stands behind 
	them, watching them.  Kira escorts Gai and Cowl over, Odo 
	following.

					HANEEK
				(pointing at the dress; 
				to Tumak)
			Intaowa.  Intaowa.

	Tumak isn't interested... he looks at a nearby display stand, 
	filled with colorful merchandise...

					SISKO
				(to Haneek)
			Dress.  It's called a dress...

	Haneek looks at him, regards him curiously, turns to Kira...

					HANEEK
			Intaowa.

					KIRA
			Intaowa?

	Tumak picks up a small, intricately designed object off a 
	display stand.  Fascinated, he begins to walk off with it, 
	only to be detained by Odo...

					ODO
			I'm afraid you'll have to put that 
			back...

	Tumak jerks it away from him, clutches the object like it's 
	his...

					TUMAK
				(defiantly)
			Vala.  Vala!

	Meanwhile, Haneek is still eyeing the dress...

					HANEEK
				(emphatically)
			Intaowa!

					KIRA
			Do you like it... ?

	Simultaneously, Odo is still trying to deal with Tumak...

13   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			Yes, it's very nice.  But it's not 
			yours...

	Then Gai also picks up an interesting gadget from the kiosk's 
	counter...

					ODO
				(to Gai)
			That goes for you, too.

	Neither Tumak nor Gai make a move to comply.

					SISKO
			Major... perhaps you'd better handle 
			this...

	Kira turns from Haneek, taps the display stand with her 
	palm...

					KIRA
			All right, let's put those back... 
			both of you...

	Tumak and Gai look to Haneek... Haneek looks to Kira...

					KIRA
				(patting stand)
			They really need to put those back...
				(a smile that takes 
				in the dress and the 
				display case)
			We can go shopping later.
				(points off)
			But right now it's important we go 
			to the Infirmary... so all of you... 
			follow me...
				(gesturing again)
			We'll all go together...

	Haneek nods.  She turns to Tumak and Gai.

					HANEEK
			Fazeek.  Cromay fazeek!

	Reluctantly, Tumak and Gai return their respective objects 
	to the counter.  The Skrreeans dutifully follow Kira down 
	the Promenade.  There's no doubt she's in charge here, leaving 
	Sisko and Odo to bring up the rear... the two exchange a 
	look that says, "Whatever works... "

16   INT. INFIRMARY - ANGLE ON ALIENS

	A reluctant Tumak allows BASHIR to examine his wound.  
	Haneek's with Tumak; Sisko, Kira and Odo stand nearby.  
	Watching curiously, shouldering each other to try to get the 
	best angle, Gai and Cowl begin to arguing.

					GAI
			Kootana...

					COWL
			Kootana batoo lakar asheem... !

					GAI
				(escalating; taking 
				offense)
			Dokka?!
				(shoving)
			Pestani voe lakar asheem!

					HANEEK
				(sharply; to Gai and 
				Cowl)
			Kolat!  Kolat kee!

	The two stop arguing.

					ODO
				(to Sisko)
			There's no doubt who the boss is...

					SISKO
				(smiles, then:)
			How bad is it, Doctor?

					BASHIR
			Looks like a second degree plasma 
			burn.  The dermal regenerator should 
			take care of it...

	Bashir picks up the dermal regenerator, starts to move in on 
	Tumak's arm.  Tumak draws back warily... Haneek swipes the 
	regenerator out of Bashir's hand and holds it out for Kira 
	to take... Kira's a little surprised, tries to explain...

					KIRA
			I'm sorry... I'm not the doctor...

					HANEEK
			Kolat?  Kolat Gadoux?

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT ONE           15A.

16   CONTINUED:

	Bashir gently takes the regenerator back out of Haneek's 
	hand...

					BASHIR
				(to Haneek, comforting)
			I assure, I won't hurt him...

	Haneek watches Bashir attend to Tumak, still suspicious about 
	what he's going to do...

					KIRA
				(to Haneek, gently)
			He'll be all right...

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT ONE            16.

16   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Haneek eyes her hopefully, then turns to watch Bashir...

17   INT. GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	Kira, Sisko and Odo ENTER the quarters, followed by Haneek 
	and her small tribe.  The aliens are still cautious, but 
	calmer than before.  (NOTE: Tumak's arm is healed.  He no 
	longer holds it in a protective way.)

					KIRA
			This will be your quarters while 
			you're here on the station.  I'm 
			sure you'd like to rest and clean up 
			and...
				(catches herself as 
				she sees their blank 
				looks)
			... you still don't understand a word 
			I'm saying, do you...

					SISKO
			I know something they might 
			understand...

	He crosses to the food replicator...

					SISKO
				(ordering)
			Seven maaza stalks...

	Seven multi-hued celery-like stalks APPEAR.  Sisko lifts a 
	stalk, takes a bite, chews...

					SISKO
			This is food.  Here -- try one --

	He holds a maaza stalk out for Haneek.  She doesn't take it.  
	Sisko has come to expect this by now, hands one to Kira.

					SISKO
			Major, show them it's okay...

	Kira takes a bite from the stalk and chews... Haneek watches 
	closely...

					KIRA
			You see?  It's really very good...

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT ONE 17-18.           

17   CONTINUED:

	Haneek reaches out for one... she sniffs it... bites in 
	gingerly... rolls the piece around on her tongue to gauge 
	the taste... she chews... satisfied, she nods to the others... 
	the males grab the stalks and begin to devour them...

					KIRA
				(watching males)
			I'm glad you like them.

	Haneek puts her hand on Kira's arm, looks into her eyes 
	imploringly.

					HANEEK
				(quickly)
			Noloux bataak rama setta... rama 
			emal jeetaka... zeela koo... Gadoux

					KIRA
				(at a loss)
			I'm sorry... I don't understand...

					HANEEK

			Bataak rama setta... rama setta... 
			zeela koo... hemena kee... soulak...

					ODO
			Wait... did you hear that?  I think 
			she just said, "need."

					SISKO
				(to Haneek, gentle 
				enthusiasm)
			Go on... keep talking...

					HANEEK
			Ganoux?  Noloux bataak rama setta... 
			my people yeekopa Skrreea... havou

			Save them!  How?  Can you understand

17   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Haneek looks at her, kind of nods, isn't sure...

					KIRA
			Keep talking... !

					HANEEK
			Noloux Skrreea... soka roo need your 
			help... there's no time soulak... we 
			are the Skrreea... my people need 
			your help... there's no time to 
			waste...

					KIRA
				(repeating to her)
			You're people are the Skrreea.  You 
			need our help.  There's no time to 
			waste.

	Haneek smiles, tears coming into her eyes -- she's understood 
	Kira.  The two women grasp each other's arms, a new bond 
	formed through the magic of the universal translator...

					SISKO
				(steps forward)
			Your people... where are they?

	Haneek looks at him, but looks at Kira when she answers.

					HANEEK
			They're on the creshnee side of the 
			Eye...

					KIRA
			The "Eye?"

					HANEEK
			The Eye of the Universe...
				(struggling to clarify)
			The tunnel...

					ODO
			I think she means the wormhole.

					HANEEK
				(nodding)
			They're on the other side... they 
			don't realize that we've found the 
			Eye...

					SISKO
			How many people are we talking about?

          DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT ONE         20.

					HANEEK
				(to Kira, a little 
				war again)
			Many... three jeetaka.

					KIRA
			Three hundred?  Three thousand?

					ODO
				(hoping he's wrong)
			Three million?

					HANEEK
				(eyes Odo, then to 
				Kira)
			Yes... three million... three million 
			of my people are on the other side... 
			we must bring them through the Eye... 
			we must bring them here.

	Haneek looks at Kira hopefully.  Hold on both Kira and Sisko, 
	suddenly realizing the enormous scope of the problem Haneek's 
	just handed them...

	Establishing.

21   INT. OPS - ANGLE ON HANEEK

	seated at the Ops table, along with Kira, Bashir, DAX, Odo 
	and O'Brien.  Haneek looks uncertainly back and forth at the 
	men.  Kira leans in (she's seated next to Haneek ) and puts 
	a hand on her arm.

					KIRA
			Is there anything wrong?

					HANEEK
			I'm just not used to the men being 
			here... Skrreean men don't involve 
			themselves in situations like this...

	Looks pass between the men.  DAX is also seated at the table.

					DAX
			Are all your leaders women?

					HANEEK
			Yes.

					BASHIR
			All of them... ?

					DAX
				(wryly)
			You heard her, Julian.

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT TWO            22.

20   CONTINUED:

					HANEEK
			Men are much too emotional to be 
			leaders.  They're always fighting 
			among themselves... it's their 
			favorite thing to do.
				(looks around)
			I'm sorry.  I hope I haven't offended 
			anyone...

	It's the men who now appear to be a little uncomfortable.  
	Sisko ENTERS from his office, comes down to the Ops table.

					SISKO
			Sorry to keep you waiting.

					DAX
				(lightly amused)
			That's all right, Benjamin.  Haneek 
			was just telling us how the Skrreea 
			are a female dominant society...

					O'BRIEN
				(vaguely patronizing)
			It seems the men are a bit too 
			emotional to become leaders...

					HANEEK
			Please don't misunderstand... we 
			love our men...
				(glancing around at 
				the males)
			Really!

	Sisko smiles to himself, then:

					SISKO
			Are you one of the leaders of your 
			people, Haneek?

					HANEEK
			Me?  Oh no... I'm little more than a 
			farmer... I was just lucky...

					BASHIR
			How so?

					HANEEK
			I was the first one to find the Eye 
			of the Universe...

          DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT TWO         23.


20   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX

				(guessing)
			You were looking for the wormhole?

					HANEEK
			We had heard about a great tunnel 
			being discovered... we knew it must 
			be the Eye of the Universe that would 
			lead us to Kentanna...

					O'BRIEN
			Kentanna?

					HANEEK
			Kentanna is the legendary home of 
			the Skrreeans... it has always been 
			portrayed in our sacred texts as 
			being just beyond the Eye of the 
			Universe... a "planet of sorrow where 
			the Skrreea will sew seeds of joy."

	A respectful beat of silence.

					SISKO
			I can't guarantee you'll find 
			Kentanna, but I can promise you we'll 
			help you find a home.
				(beat)
			I've sent our runabouts to the Gamma 
			Quadrant to make contact with your 
			ships.

					HANEEK
			That will be difficult... they're 
			spread out, looking for the Eye...

					ODO
			When we do find them, what then?  
			This station only holds seven thousand 
			people... and you're talking about 
			three million Skrreeans...

					KIRA
			I'm afraid most of your people will 
			have to stay confined to their 
			ships...

					HANEEK
			I understand.

20   CONTINUED:	(3)

			In the meantime, is there any one

			leader... or leaders... ?

					HANEEK
			Most of our leaders were killed by 
			the T-Rogorans.

					BASHIR
			The T-Rogorans?  Who are they?

					HANEEK
			For eight centuries my people have 
			lived under their rule... we were 
			forced to work as laborers and 
			servants... we were able to escape 
			when the T-Rogorans were invaded and 
			conquered...

					ODO
			Who conquered them?

					HANEEK
			I don't know their name.  All I know 
			is they were members of something 
			called "The Dominion"...

	Everyone reacts... they've all heard the name before...

23   INT. GUEST QUARTERS

	The lights are dimmed as we hear the door CHIME.  A sleep 
	Haneek appears from the back.  She presses a panel to open 
	the door, finds Kira, package in hand, standing in the 
	corridor.

					KIRA
			Did I wake you?

					HANEEK
			It's all right.  Please, come in...

	Haneek steps back into the center of the room.  Kira 
	tentatively ENTERS.

			I can come back later...

					HANEEK
			No.  You've been so kind to me, how 
			could I possibly refuse your company?

	Gai and Cowl STUMBLE OUT, sleepy-eyed, wondering what's up.  
	Haneek practically shoos them away...

					HANEEK
			go back to bed.  Go on!  I'll join 
			you again after I'm through...

	The two males yawn and scratch themselves, EXIT back the way 
	they came.

					KIRA
				(wondering)
			Are those your... husbands?

					HANEEK
			Hus-bands?  I'm not familiar with 
			that word.  They're bonded to me.

					KIRA
				(can't resist)
			Do you... sleep with them... both?

					HANEEK
			Of course.  Don't you sleep with 
			your males?

					KIRA
			No, I don't have any males... not at 
			the moment, anyway...

					HANEEK
				(slyly, re: her two)
			They're very useful...

					KIRA
			Yes, I imagine they are...
				(remembering why she's 
				there)
			I just wanted to tell you, we found 
			some of your ships.  Several hundred 
			Skrreeans should be arriving on the 
			station today... we thought it would 
			be a good idea if you were there to 
			meet them.

	Haneek sits down, uncertain about this.

					HANEEK
				(simply)
			Why me?

					KIRA
			You yourself said most of your leaders 
			were dead...

					HANEEK
			Yes, that's true... but I'm just a 
			farmer...

					KIRA
			You were also the first one through 
			the Eye of the Universe... that must 
			mean something, in a symbolic sort 
			of way...

	Haneek looks at her, not denying that it does.  Kira remembers 
	the package she has in her hand.

					KIRA
			Oh... here.
				(hands package to 
				Haneek)
			I brought you a little something.

	Haneek holds it, eyes Kira, surprised and flattered...

					KIRA
			Go ahead.  Open it.

	Haneek slowly lifts the lid... and pulls out the brightly 
	colored, oddly designed dress from the clothing kiosk... the 
	one Haneek saw earlier...

					KIRA
			You seemed to like it...

				(a little embarrassed)
			I'm sorry... but I think you 
			misunderstood...

					KIRA
			What do you mean?

					HANEEK
			I thought this was the most hideous 
			thing I'd ever seen.

					KIRA
				(beat; she laughs)
			Well, that makes two of us.

					HANEEK
				(laughing)
			It's awful!

					KIRA
			Horrible!  Who would wear it?

	Hold on the two of them laughing at the backfired gift...

24   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	JAKE and NOG are at their hangout spot at the railing.  AS

			Look -- it was no big deal --

			You go out with a dabo girl for the

			with their homework...

					NOG
			Good thinking.  Too bad I won't ever 
			be able to use that lie.  My dad 
			knows I never do homework...

					JAKE
			It's not a lie, Nog.  Mardah's 
			studying entomology.  She asked me

					NOG
			A dabo girl who studies entomology...
				(sarcastically)
			...sure.

					JAKE
			It's true!

					NOG
				(thinking)
			What is entomology?

					JAKE
			The study of bugs.

					NOG
			You mean she wants to be a chef?

	Jake shakes his head.  Sometimes there's no talking to his 
	Ferengi friend.  He reacts to something below.

			Hey -- who's that?

				(looks down, sees)
			I don't know.  What's he doing?

					NOG
			That's disgusting --

			He must be one of the Skrreeans.  My

29   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

	The airlock opens... and the first of an unending number of

30   INT. PROMENADE - SEVERAL SHOTS

	Skrreean refugees are pouring into the Promenade... Skrreean 
	females lead the pack, their male partners (multiple) and 
	children following behind... (NOTE: This should be the most 
	extras -- primarily Skrreeans -- we have ever seen on the 
	Promenade... budget willing... ) Among the Skrreean is an

			Me?!  You're the one who stinks!

					TUMAK
			That's because you sprayed that vapor 
			on us... !

					ODO
			Is that true, Nog?

					NOG
			No!

					ODO
				(not believing him)
			Nog... ?

					NOG
				(dismissive)
			It was a joke... !

					ODO
				(eyeing him sternly)
			Very amusing.
				(addressing the 
				Skrreeans)
			Thank you for bringing this to my 
			attention.  I'll take care of it 
			from here.

	Odo turns Nog around and escorts him away.

					TUMAK
				(calling to Nog)
			This isn't over yet, Big Ears!

	Jake and Tumak look at each other, Tumak still angry, then 
	Tumak and his friends depart the way they came.  Jake waves 
	his hand in front of his nose... whatever the odor is, it's 
	pretty sour...

33A  INT. SECURITY OFFICE - ANGLE ON NOG

	who stands looking at the "wanted posters," his eyes wide 
	with interest.  He points to one in particular.

					NOG
			Hey... here's a new one!
				(reading)
			What kind of name is "Plix Tixiplik?"

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/12/93 - ACT THREE       33A.

33A  CONTINUED:

	Widen to show Odo working with a PADD at his desk, not 
	looking for conversation.

					ODO
			I believe he's a Reegrunion.

	Odo continues working.  Nog studies Plix Tixiplik's data.

					NOG
				(reading)
			"Wanted in seven star systems for 
			illegal weapon sales."
				(admiringly)
			Weapon sales, huh?  Very profitable.

					ODO
			How would you know?

					NOG
				(without thinking)
			My Uncle Quark told me.

					ODO
			What does your Uncle Quark know about 
			illegal weapon sales?

	Nog realizes he's revealed family secrets best left unsaid.

					NOG
				(trying to cover)
			He, uh... he, uh...

					QUARK (O.S.)
				(finishing Nog's 
				statement)
			... knows better than to ever get 
			involved in anything so 
			disreputable...

33B  ANGLE ON QUARK

	standing just inside the entrance.  He gives a quick glare 
	at Nog, silently reminding him to never discuss Ferengi 
	business with strangers.

					ODO
				(to Quark; dryly 
				cynical)
			I'm sure.  I asked the boy's father 
			come see me...

					QUARK
			Rom is doing the weekly stock

			count... so I came in his place.
				(lightly chastising)
			Nog... have you been causing mischief 
			again?

					NOG
			No, Uncle.  It's all a 
			misunderstanding.

					ODO
			He sprayed some Skrreean boys with a 
			foul-smelling vapor.

					QUARK
				(smiling in approval)
			Did he...
				(catching himself; to 
				Nog; mock sternly)
			What do you have to say for yourself?

					NOG
				(guessing)
			I'm sorry... ?

					QUARK
				(to Odo)
			You see?  The boy's beside himself 
			with guilt.

					ODO
			That still doesn't excuse his actions.

					QUARK
			And he will be punished.  Severely.

					NOG
				(surprised)
			I will?

					QUARK
				(to Nog)
			I want you to tell the Constable

			Can I leave now?

					ODO
			Go on.

	Relieved, Nog EXITS.

					QUARK
			You know, you really can't blame the

					ODO
			And why's that?

					QUARK
			Come on, Odo... you know these 
			Skrreeans are nothing but trouble.  
			They're all over the station, looking 
			and touching but never spending any 
			money.  And they flake.

					ODO
			I didn't notice.

					QUARK
			Come to my place... you'll see little 
			pieces of Skrreean skin all over the 
			bar and the floor... it's disgusting.

					ODO
			They won't be here long.

					QUARK
			I hope not.  They're driving my paying 
			customers away.  They stay here too 
			long and I'll be out of business...

					ODO
			In that case, I hope they never leave.

	harrumphs, and resumes working on his PADD...

34   INT. QUARK'S

	Skrreeans wander the premises, taking in everything, touching 
	everything, ordering nothing.  Again, we see arguments break 
	out among them, leading to some pushing and shoving, only to 
	die down before anything serious erupts... off to the side, 
	Varani plays a spritely TUNE...

           DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT THREE           34.

35   ANGLE ON CORNER TABLE

	A meeting of five Skrreean women is in progress, one of them 
	Haneek, one of them the ages-old crone, Vayna.  Vayna is 
	addressing Haneek solemnly.

					VAYNA
			We've talked it over among 
			ourselves... our feelings were 
			unanimous... you discovered the Eye 
			of the Universe... you must lead us 
			the rest of the way...

					HANEEK
				(quiet acceptance)
			I'll do the best I can...

	The decision having been made, the four women get up and 
	leave... Haneek falls deep into thought...

	Kira APPEARS at the table, looking after the departing 
	women...

					KIRA
			That looked pretty serious.  Is 
			everything all right?

	Haneek looks out over the Skrreeans in the bar...

					HANEEK
			Look at them... look at my people...

36   MAIN FLOOR OF QUARK'S - KIRA AND HANEEK'S POV

	Many of the Skrreeans have settled in at the tables, talking 
	and laughing, generally enjoying the give-and-take 
	conversation conducive to an open environment... there's 
	even a small group gathered around Varani, enjoying his 
	music...

					HANEEK (O.S.)
			I've never seen them so happy...

37   RESUME - KIRA AND HANEEK (OPTICAL)

	Haneek looks down, a little lost.

					HANEEK

					KIRA
			Why?


					HANEEK
			They expect me to lead them to 
			Kentanna.


	This weighs heavily on her...

					KIRA
			It's going to be okay.  Commander 
			Sisko's doing all he can to find you 
			a place to live...

	Haneek looks at Kira.  She still looks like she has the weight 
	of the world on her.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			You're not alone.

	Haneek smiles, grateful for Kira's support.  Varani ambles 
	over to them...

					VARANI
			I hope I'm not intruding...

					KIRA
			Not at all... Haneek, this is 
			Varani... a great musician... maybe 
			the greatest Bajor has ever known...

           DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT THREE           36.

					VARANI
				(to Haneek)
			She exaggerates...
				(smiles at Kira)
			... but that's why I'm so fond of 
			her...
				(to Haneek)
			Being a Bajoran, I know what it's 
			like to be... displaced.  As a token 
			of friendship, I'd like to give you... 
			this...

	Varani places a small pedestal-type box on the table, taps 
	it once on the top.  A tiny HOLOGRAM appears... a young 
	Varani, dashingly handsome, superbly dressed, plays his tivara 
	masterfully, beautifully... the TUNE, rich and evocative, 
	perhaps a little sad, is about as loud as a music box...

					VARANI
			It's from a concert I gave many years 
			ago... at the Jalanda Forum...

	Haneek is clearly touched.  She finds the music charming.  
	AS Kira, Haneek and Varani enjoy this insular little moment 
	in an otherwise very public place, push in on the HOLOGRAM...

38   INT. GUEST QUARTERS - CLOSE ON

	a tabletop as Haneek's hand enters and sets the hologram box 
	down.  Tilt up to Haneek, looking down at the box, comforted 
	by it somehow... Tumak ENTERS the quarters... Haneek smiles 
	at her son...

					HANEEK
			Tumak -- where've you been?

					TUMAK
				(sullenly)
			Nowhere...

	He heads for the back hallway...

					HANEEK
			Where are you going?

					TUMAK
			To wash...

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/12/93 - ACT THREE        37.

38   CONTINUED:

	And he EXITS.  Haneek looks down at Varani's box again... 
	she's thoughtful a beat... then, getting an idea, a hunch, a 
	feeling, she walks over and sits down in front of a monitor...

					HANEEK
			Computer -- please show me a chart 
			of this star system...

	Confidence is starting to grow inside her...

39   INT. PROMENADE

	Jake and Nog react to packs of wandering Skrreea as they ascend 
	the stairs to the second level.

					JAKE
			So what did your Dad say?

					NOG
			About what?

					JAKE
			About your getting in trouble with 
			Odo.

					NOG
			He was very angry.

					JAKE
			He was?

					NOG
			He always gets angry when I get 
			caught.

40   THE SECOND LEVEL - JAKE AND NOG

	as they approach their hangout spot at the railing, only to 
	find Tumak and his two feral teenage friends having taken it 
	over... standing tall... glaring at Nog...

					NOG
				(turning tail)
			I just remembered... I've got errands 
			to run for my uncle...

           DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT THREE           38.

					JAKE
				(restrains him)
			You're going to have to face them 
			sooner or later...

	Jake and Nog move forward... Tumak meets them head on.

					TUMAK

				(to Nog)
			That was very funny, what you did.

					NOG
				(false hope)
			You see, Jake?  Now there's a man 
			with a sense of humor...

					TUMAK
				(menacing)
			Nobody's laughing.

					JAKE
			And luckily nobody got hurt.  I think 
			my friend's sorry for what he did...

	Jake looks to Nog, hoping he'll say something... Nog isn't 
	offering...

					JAKE
				(elbows Nog)
			Aren't you, Nog...

					NOG
				(reluctantly)
			I suppose...

					JAKE
				(to Tumak)
			See?  What did I tell you?

					TUMAK
			He doesn't sound sorry to me...

	And before anybody can react, Tumak wallops Nog in the stomach 
	with a punch... all three Skreean teenagers jump Jake and 
	Nog... and the donnybrook is on...

41   SECOND FLOOR - QUARK'S

	Quark is serving a customer when he's distracted by the NOISE 
	of the fight... he sees the combatants across the way...

42   SECOND LEVEL - THE FIGHT

	It's mostly shoving and pushing... the Skrreean are throwing 
	occasional punches... Jake's trying to push them back... 
	Nog's got his head covered, yelping...

					NOG
				(means it)
			I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!

	Quark rushes up...

					QUARK
			All right, that's enough... break it 
			up... I said, break it up!

	The other two Skrreean back off, but Tumak starts to throw 
	another punch at Nog.  Quark restrains him.

					QUARK
				(to Tumak)
			It's bad enough all of you are hanging 
			around the station without buying 
			anything... you have to start 
			fighting, too?

	Quark suddenly lets him go.  Tumak steps back, angry...

					TUMAK
			I thought we were welcome here...

					QUARK
			Well make yourselves welcome somewhere 
			else.

					TUMAK
			You don't want us here.  You don't 
			want anything to do with us.  Well 
			we don't want anything to do with 
			you.  Any of you!

	Tumak glares at Jake and Nog again, then stomps off with his 
	two companions.

					QUARK
			I can see the Skrreean don't bother

			A "planet of sorrow," Kira... don't

	Vedek, VEDEK SORAD, are seated in the office, along with 
	Sisko, Kira and Haneek.

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			First of all, I want you all to know 
			that the provisional government has 
			taken the Skrreeans' request for 
			immigration very seriously.  The 
			debate in the Chamber of Ministers 
			became quite heated at times...
				(attempt at humor to 
				lighten the situation)
			Though I suppose you could say that 
			about all of our debates...

					SISKO
			But a decision was reached...

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT FOUR           44.

49   CONTINUED:

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			Yes.
				(to Haneek)
			I was sent here to tell you that the 
			Ministers --
				(a nod to Sorad)
			-- in accord with the Vedek Assembly -- 
			have decided to deny the Skrreeans' 
			request.

	Haneek stiffens... she wasn't expecting this... she can't 
	take her eyes off Minister Rozahn...

					MINISTER ROZAHN
				(to Haneek; 
				sympathetically)
			I'm sorry.

	Haneek feels the desperation seeping into her, starting to 
	overwhelm everything else...

					VEDEK SORAD
			Bajor simply cannot absorb three 
			million refugees at this time...

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			After what the Cardassians did to 
			our planet, we can barely take care 
			of our own.

					HANEEK
			But no one is asking you to take 
			care of us... !

					VEDEK SORAD
				(sympathetic)
			This decision is not based strictly 
			on Bajoran self-interest.  Such a 
			huge increase in population would 
			prove to be tragic to your people as 
			well as ours.

					HANEEK
			But Bajor has more than enough room 
			for us.  The plains of the northwest 
			peninsula are practically uninhabited.  
			The land's ideal for farming.

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			It used to be... before the 
			Cardassians got their hands on it.

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT FOUR           45.

49   CONTINUED:	(2)

					HANEEK
				(pleading)
			Minister Rozahn, the Skrreeans are 
			farmers... just give us the land... 
			I guarantee you we can make it thrive 
			again...

					MINISTER ROZAHN
				(non-accusatory)
			Under ideal circumstances, perhaps 
			you could.  But what if the 
			circumstances aren't ideal?  What if 
			we go through another long winter?  
			What if your crops fail?  What if 
			the famine that has been plaguing 
			Bajor continues to spread?  What 
			then?

					HANEEK
			We're willing to take that risk...

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			We aren't.  We ran a series of 
			projections to see whether a Skrreean 
			settlement could survive on the 
			northwest peninsula.  The results 
			were not encouraging.

					SISKO
				(to Haneek)
			Haneek, I think you should seriously 
			consider Draylon Two as an alternate 
			to Bajor.  The winters are mild, 
			there's plenty of good farmland...

					HANEEK
				(forcefully)
			No!
				(to Rozahn and Sorad)
			Projections can be wrong...

					VEDEK SORAD
			But what if they're not?  What is 
			Bajor to do if your people start 
			dying?

					HANEEK
			I thought I made it clear.  We're 
			not expecting your help.

49   CONTINUED:	(3)

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			Do you really think we could stand 
			by and do nothing?  We'd feel 
			obligated to help.  With food, with 
			clothing, with whatever it would 
			take...

					VEDEK SORAD
			And where would that aid come from?  
			Our resources are already depleted.  
			To help you would mean depriving our 
			own people.

					MINISTER ROZAHN
			I'm afraid the decision of the 
			provisional government is final.  
			The Skrreea will have to find 
			somewhere else to live.

					HANEEK
				(desperately; to Kira)
			Talk to them... please... tell them 
			that they're wrong...

	All eyes turn to Kira.

					HANEEK
				(continuing; simply)
			Help us.

	Kira's filled with sympathy for Haneek, but...

					KIRA
				(softly)
			I can't.

	Haneek's stunned.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			I'm sorry, Haneek... but they're 
			right.  I wish they weren't... I 
			wish Bajor was Kentanna... but it's 
			not.

	Still desperate, Haneek looks to Sisko.

					SISKO
				(gently)
			There's still Draylon Two.

	Haneek isn't buying it.  HOLD on Kira, still feeling the 
	weight of her decision...

	They move up in line, Jake studying Tumak quietly, wondering 
	about what he just said...

51   INT. GUEST QUARTERS - ON HANEEK

	She sits by herself, the lights dimmed by half... though 
	she's not crying, her sadness is palpable...

	The door CHIMES... Haneek doesn't move...

					HANEEK
				(calling tonelessly)
			Come in...

	Kira ENTERS.  She's behind Haneek.  Haneek doesn't turn to 
	see who it is.  Kira watches her a moment...

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT FOUR           49.

51   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Haneek...

					HANEEK
			The thing I don't understand is why 
			you pretended to be my friend.

					KIRA
			I wasn't pretending.

					HANEEK
			Ahhh.  So you are my friend...
				(looks at her)
			... until I need you.

					KIRA
			I know it's hard for you to see right 
			now, but I am trying to help...

					HANEEK
			I think I've had quite enough of 
			your help...

					KIRA
			You have to believe me, Commander 
			Sisko has found you a wonderful 
			home...

					HANEEK
			You betrayed me, Kira.

					KIRA
			No, I didn't.  I honestly believe 
			the provisional government made the 
			right decision, for both Bajor and 
			the Skrreeans...

					HANEEK
			If that's true, then we have nothing 
			to discuss.

					KIRA
			I was hoping we could still be 
			friends...

					HANEEK
			In other words, you came looking for 
			forgiveness...
				(beat)
			Well I don't forgive you.

	A beat...

            DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - 10/08/93 - ACT FOUR           50.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE
			Sisko to Kira.

					KIRA
				(his combadge)
			Go ahead, Commander.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE
			Is Haneek with you?

					KIRA
			Yes.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE
			I need both of you in Ops immediately.  
			Tumak has taken a ship.  He's headed 
			for Bajor...

	As Haneek and Kira exchange concerned looks, we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

52   INT. OPS

	Kira and Haneek ENTER off the Turbolift... Sisko, Dax and 
	O'Brien are already there... various Supernumeraries are in 
	the b.g... the tension is palpable...

					O'BRIEN
			They're not responding, sir...

					SISKO
			Keep trying, Mister O'Brien...

					KIRA
			How did it happen?

					SISKO
			With all the traffic around the 
			station, Tumak and two of his friends 
			were able to slip away... we had no 
			idea the ship was even gone until 
			the Bajorans contacted us...
				(approaches Haneek)
			Haneek, I need you to try to talk to 
			your son...

	Sisko leads her to the Ops table.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Haneek; from his 
				station)
			There's a high-energy radiation leak 
			in the port nacelle.  We've tried to 
			make him aware of it, but he refuses 
			to acknowledge us...

					SISKO
			Major, open a channel to the Skrreean 
			vessel...

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE         52.

52   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(hits panel)
			Yes, sir.
				(beat)
			Ready.

	Sisko nods at Haneek to start talking... she's unsure what 
	to say...

					HANEEK
			Tumak... listen to me... your ship's 
			in danger...

					SISKO
				(low)
			Have him turn off his engines and 
			drift until the Bajorans can tractor 
			him in...

					HANEEK
			Tumak... turn off your engines... 
			you must turn off your engines 
			now...

					SISKO
				(beat)
			Mister O'Brien... ?

					O'BRIEN
				(reading his monitor)
			He's not responding...

					HANEEK
				(to com)
			Tumak, this is serious... your life's 
			in danger... the others who are with 
			you, their lives are in danger... 
			please... answer me...

	No response.

					DAX
			Sensors are detecting two Bajoran 
			vessels closing in on the Skrreean 
			ship...

					SISKO
			On screen...

	They all look at an Ops table monitor...

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/12/93 - ACT FIVE         53.

53   INSERT - AN OKUDAGRAM (OPTICAL)

	A colored grid with a star-filled background... graphic 
	symbols represent the Skrreean vessel... and the two Bajoran 
	crafts entering the screen from the bottom corner, converging 
	toward it...

54   BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)

					SISKO
			Mister O'Brien, patch us into the 
			Bajoran interceptor.

					O'BRIEN
			Aye, sir.

	O'Brien works his panel.  Finally:

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			... have entered restricted space... 
			you must turn around and leave 
			immediately...

					KIRA
				(to O'Brien)
			Open a channel.

	O'Brien nods.

					KIRA
				(to com)
			This is Major Kira Nerys on Deep 
			Space Nine... the Skrreean vessel 
			has refused to acknowledge our 
			hails... it's possible their 
			communications are down... you have 
			to let them land...

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			That's impossible, Major... we have 
			strict orders not to allow any 
			Skrreean vessel to land...

					KIRA
			But the pilot's just a boy... he's 
			taken the ship without permission... 
			It's barely operational.  We're not 
			sure he can get back here.

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			I'm sorry, Major, but we have our 
			orders.

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE        53A.

54   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Who gave them to you?

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			They come directly from General Hazar.

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE         54.

54   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Kira looks at Haneek... it's getting serious...

					SISKO
			Dax, get me General Hazar on Bajor... 
			tell his people it's an emergency... 
			I want to speak with him now...

	Dax nods, hits her panels...

					KIRA
				(to the pilot)
			Stand by, interceptor.  General Hazar 
			will be countermanding those orders 
			any minute...

					O'BRIEN
			The interceptor's closing on the 
			Skrreean ship...

	Kira and Haneek look at the monitor...

55   INSERT - THE OKUDAGRAM (OPTICAL)

	The two graphics representing the Bajoran ships are slicing 
	in on the approaching Skrreean ship...

56   RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)

					DAX
			It's General Hazar, Benjamin...

					SISKO
			On screen...

	All eyes turn to the Viewscreen as the Bajoran general, 
	GENERAL HAZAR appears.

					HAZAR
			What's this about, Commander?

					SISKO
			It's about the Skrreean ship that's 
			approaching Bajor...

					HAZAR
			I've already given orders to have it 
			turned back...

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE         55.

56   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			That ship is being flown by a child... 
			and it's leaking radiation...

					HAZAR
			A child... ?

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			... Skrreean ship.  Repeating: return 
			to the space station now.

					HAZAR
				(to Sisko)
			Have him shut down his engines.  
			We'll tow him back...

					HANEEK
				(desperately)
			Tumak, please... turn off your 
			engines...

	Over com, we HEAR the sound of phaser fire...

					KIRA
			Interceptor One, what's going on?

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			They've opened fire on us... taking 
			evasive action...

					HANEEK
			Tumak!  Don't do this!

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			He's pursuing... we've been hit... !

					O'BRIEN
			Commander -- they're returning fire...

					HANEEK
				(screams)
			No... !

					KIRA
				(shouts)
			Disengage, interceptor!  Repeat: 
			disengage!

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/12/93 - ACT FIVE        55A.

56   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
				(forcefully)
			General, tell you pilots to hold 

			their fire.

					HAZAR
			I'm relaying that order now...

	Sisko, Kira and Haneek turn to the Ops table monitor...

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE         56.

57   INSERT - THE OKUDAGRAM (OPTICAL)

	A beat, the three symbols representing the ships closer now... 
	then the graphic representing the Skrreean vessel suddenly 
	BRIGHTENS... and disappears...

58   RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)

	Haneek stiffens, grasps Sisko's arm, as if she herself has 
	been struck... Sisko holds her...

					KIRA
			Interceptor One... ?

					PILOT'S COM VOICE
			The Skrreean ship exploded.
				(beat)
			I didn't even think we hit it...

					O'BRIEN
				(grimly, to Sisko)
			The phaser beam must've ignited the 
			radiation leak...

	Still on the viewscreen, General Hazar looks saddened...

					HAZAR
			Commander... I'm so sorry...

					SISKO
			We all are, General...

	Kira turns to Haneek... the two women look at each other... 
	there's nothing Kira can say... she feels Haneek's pain... 
	Haneek squares her shoulders, eyes Kira coldly... as if her 
	anger and pain fuses into her backbone... giving her an 
	emotionally charged, if icy strength...

58AA   EXT. SPACE STATION (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

58A  INT. DOCKING RING AIRLOCK

	A stoic Haneek directs a procession of Skrreea through the 
	airlock door to a docked Skrreean vessel.  Gai and Cowl wait 
	for her nearby.  Several Federation and Bajoran security 
	guards help oversee the operation.

58B  ANGLE - KIRA

	as she approaches.  Haneek sees her.  A beat.

         DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE         57.

58B  CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(simply)
			I just came by to wish you luck on 
			Draylon Two.


	Haneek nods sadly.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			Haneek, I still believe this is the 
			best choice... for Bajor and for 
			you.

					HANEEK
			And you believe we would have been a 
			burden to your people...

					KIRA
				(a long beat)
			Yes.

					HANEEK
				(nods; it's the answer 
				she expected)
			I think you've made a terrible 
			mistake.  All of you.  Maybe we could 
			have helped you.  Maybe we could 
			have helped each other.  The Skrreeans 
			are farmers, Kira.  You have a famine 
			on your planet.  We might have made 
			that peninsula bloom again.  We'll 
			never know, will we?

	Kira nods... tries to think of the right thing to say.

					HANEEK
				(continuing)
			Fifty years of Cardassian rule has 
			made you all frightened and 
			suspicious.
				(beat)
			I feel sorry for you.

      DEEP SPACE: "Sanctuary" - REV. 10/11/93 - ACT FIVE 58-59.        

58B  CONTINUED:  (2)  

					HANEEK
				(beat; coldly)
			You were right.  Bajor is not 
			Kentanna.

	Haneek turns and enters the Skrreean ship, leaving Kira 
	standing alone and feeling alone, as she ponders Haneek's 
	last words...
