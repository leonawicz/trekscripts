1    CLOSEUP OF O'BRIEN

	Sitting.

					O'BRIEN
			The truth is I'm a career man...
			you know, married to my job...
			Mitzi doesn't understand that...
			I like her a lot... but I just
			don't think I'm ready for two
			marriages if you know what I
			mean...

2    REVERSE OF TROI - TROI'S OFFICE

	She's placid as usual, listening, or perhaps on
	automatic pilot.

					O'BRIEN
				(continuing)
			But at the same time, you know
			I wouldn't want to lose her...

					TROI
			Maybe you should come in with her
			and talk about it together.

					O'BRIEN
			Oh, I couldn't ask her to do
			that...

					TROI
			Sure you could. Why don't I make
			another appointment for you...

	And as she calls up her schedule on a PADD.

3    INT. CORRIDOR

	Troi walking, looking very tired... Wes sees her,
	calls... moves down another corridor to her...

					WESLEY
			Counselor Troi... ?

	She takes the fatigue off her face, stops and turns...

					TROI
			Yes, Wesley...

					WESLEY
			Can I talk to you a minute... I
			have a real problem with my
			mother.

4    ON TROI

	who listens patiently as Wesley continues...

					WESLEY (O.S.)
			She's being completely
			unreasonable... see there's a
			party on Holodeck Four tonight...
			and all the other kids are staying
			overnight... well, most of them
			and...

	As she nods...

5    INT. TROI'S QUARTERS

	Troi ENTERS, exhausted, starts to take off her
	jacket...

					TROI
			Computer, dispatches...

					COMPUTER
			A research inquiry from the
			Manitoba Journal of
			Interplanetary Psychology and
			three communiques from your
			mother...

					TROI
				(reacts, three?)
			Transfer my mother's letters to
			my viewer...

					TROI (Cont'd)
				(beat)
			... and computer, I'd like a...
			a real chocolate sundae.

					COMPUTER
				(beat)
			Define "real" in context, please.

					TROI
			Real... not one of your perfectly
			synthesized, ingeniously enhanced
			imitations... real chocolate ice
			cream, real whipped cream...

					COMPUTER
			This unit is programmed to provide
			sources of nutritional value.
			Your request does not fall within
			current guidelines.

	Losing patience...

					TROI
			Listen, computer...

					COMPUTER
				(continuing)
			Do you wish to override program?

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Picard to Counselor Troi.

					TROI
				(frowns, to herself)
			Now what?
				(keys insignia)
			Yes, Captain?

6    INT. TEN FORWARD

	A casual party in progress... PICARD, WORF, RIKER,
	DATA.

	In the background, MENDOZA, a Federation negotiator,
	chats with several aliens including BHAVANI, the leader
	of Barzan, and LEYOR, the Caldonian representative.
	PICARD is smiling, jovial. A WAITER refills his
	champagne glass and not for the first time.

					PICARD
			The pleasure of your company is
			requested, Counselor. We're
			having an impromptu reception for
			the arriving delegates.

					TROI
				(reacts, not tonight)
			Captain, I'm not dressed for a
			reception...

					PICARD
			Oh, just throw on any old thing.
			We're about to get our first look
			at the wormhole.

									BACK TO:

7    INT. TROI'S QUARTERS

					TROI
			Of course, Captain. I'm on my
			way. Troi out.

	EXITING, frowns...

					TROI
				(to herself)
			God forbid, I should miss the
			first look at the wormhole.

8    INT. TEN FORWARD (OPTICAL)

	GEORDI and BEVERLY have joined the fun now too...
	waiters serve hors d'ouevres... Troi ENTERS, smiling,
	serene, our Troi... Riker goes to meet her... offers
	an arm...

					RIKER
			May I escort you in, Miss Troi...

	Moving with them...

8    CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Just tell me there's some
			chocolate here...

					PICARD
			Ah, Counselor Troi... allow me
			to do the introductions... Premier
			Bhavani of the Barzan...

	Bhavani is a strong, no-nonsense, elderly woman; an
	able judge of people. She wears a breathing device.

					TROI
			Your discovery has certainly
			produced a great deal of
			excitement, Premier.

					BHAVANI
			Hopefully, it will also produce
			a new era of prosperity for my
			people.

					MENDOZA
			We'll see to that...

					PICARD
			You know Mister Mendoza, the
			Federation negotiator...

					MENDOZA
			A pleasure to see you again,
			Counselor Troi.

	Mendoza is a middle-aged man with intelligent eyes and
	confidence.

					PICARD
			One of the Federation's worthy
			competitors in the bidding, Leyor
			of the Caldonians.

					LEYOR
			Madame.

	The Caldonian is more reserved -- with a quietness that
	comes more from academia than from shyness. Joining
	them is DEVINONI RAL, a well-dressed, strikingly
	attractive man with a disarming smile. On his arm is a
	stunning woman, an accessory.

					DEVINONI
			And I am Devinoni Ral.

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					TROI
			Ship's Counselor Deanna Troi.

	And it's already there between them in the moment, they
	both feel it. Introducing his lady friend as a pro
	forma aside --

					DEVINONI
			My traveling companion, Rojay.

	The woman, bored, barely acknowledges.

					MENDOZA
			My good friend, Ral, is the best
			hired gun in the business.

					TROI
			Hired gun?

					DEVINONI
			My "good friend", Mendoza means
			that I am a negotiator who serves
			a variety of clients... on this
			occasion I represent the
			Chrysalians.

					BHAVANI
			I believe it's almost time, isn't
			it Captain?

					PICARD
			Indeed. It will be visible
			directly ahead...

	The crowd moves to the windows...

					MENDOZA
			Is it always on time, Bhavani?

					BHAVANI
			Always. We see it every two
			hundred and thirty-three
			minutes... our scientists say it's
			due to radiation buildup in the
			acretion disk. The visible burst
			is very brief..

	On her last line... the sky lights up with a dramatic
	revelation... a wormhole... reactions.

8    CONTINUED: (3)

					BHAVANI
			There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
			The Barzan Wormhole. The first
			and only stable wormhole known
			to exist. It's yours... for the
			right price.

	The group is overwhelmed at the spectacular sight
	before their eyes... except as we see Troi, she senses
	something else and as she turns, she sees Devinoni is
	not looking at the wormhole, but at her. Her eyes meet
	his... and he grins... and as the rest of the room sees
	stars... they see only each other as we...

	FADE IN:

9    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit around the Barzan planet.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, Stardate 43385.7.
			We are in orbit around Barzan,
			a planet which is entertaining
			bids for control of
			what appears to be a most unique,
			stable wormhole. It could
			conceivably provide a permanent
			shortcut within our galaxy.

10   INT. OBSERVATION DECK (OPTICAL)

	Picard, Worf, Bhavani, Mendoza, Leyor, Devinoni.
	Bhavani is at the head of the table, addressing the
	others...

					BHAVANI
			And as you all know, the
			environment on my planet is
			completely inhospitable to most
			other life forms. So I'd like
			to express my appreciation to you,
			Captain Picard, and your fine crew
			for hosting these negotiations
			aboard the Enterprise.
				(Picard acknowledges)
			Remember, Mister Mendoza, it
			doesn't give the Federation an
			advantage.

	Chuckles around the table. Mendoza acknowledges.
	Devinoni studies his competition around the table.
	He deliberately plays back throughout the scene. But
	he's working.

       STAR TREK: "The Price" - REV. 9/29/89 - ACT ONE       9.

10   CONTINUED:

					BHAVANI
				(getting serious)
			The Barzan has been a society
			dependent on others for
			generations. We want that to end.
			The appearance of this stable
			wormhole in our space provides
			us with our first true natural
			resource. We have neither the
			experience nor technology to
			exploit it. You do.

	Riker ENTERS, with some concern on his face...

					RIKER
			Excuse me, a delegation of...
			Ferengi... wishes to be beamed
			aboard...

					PICARD
			You were not expecting the
			Ferengi, Premier... ?

					BHAVANI
			No, but I do not wish to create
			ill will, Captain. If they are
			interested in bidding, I have no
			objection.

	Picard thinks about saying he does... but realizes it's
	not his place. Very well...

					PICARD
				(keys insignia)
			Chief O'Brien, this is Picard.
			Beam the Ferengi directly to the
			observation lounge.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			Aye, Captain...

	Three Ferengi MATERIALIZE near Riker. Their leader
	is GOSS. The others are KOL AND ARRIDOR.

					GOSS
			On behalf of all Ferengi, I
			protest... why were we not invited
			to these negotiations...

      STAR TREK: "The Price" - REV. 9/25/89 - ACT ONE      10.

10   CONTINUED: (2)

	Riker exchanges a glance with Picard...

					BHAVANI
			My apologies. We did not
			anticipate your interest. You
			are welcome to join us.

					GOSS
			I am DaiMon Goss. These are my
			consuls... Kol and Doctor Arridor.
				(to Riker)
			We'll need chairs...

	Standing... and this must all be a quick exchange --

					PICARD
			DaiMon, I am Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard of the Enterprise... I'm
			serving as host for these
			proceedings...

					GOSS
			Good, then see to it that we get
			chairs at once.

					PICARD
				(with an edge)
			Perhaps you misunderstood...

					GOSS
			Fine, fine, just have your Klingon
			servant...

					WORF
				(pointed)
			I am in charge of security.

					GOSS
			Then who gets the chairs?

					PICARD
			DaiMon, due to the intimate nature
			of these negotiations, all parties
			agreed that one representative
			would suffice. I will be happy
			to provide your consuls with
			accommodations... and you may have
			my chair...

					GOSS
			Very well. Kol, the bag...

      STAR TREK: "The Price" - REV. 9/29/89 - ACT ONE      11.

10   CONTINUED: (3)

	Kol hands Goss a sack... Riker leads Kol and Arridor
	out. They EXIT. Picard moves toward the door as
	Goss exchanges places with him.

					GOSS
			We can handle all the pleasantries
			later. I'm sure I'll never
			remember your names anyway, eh?
				(laughs)
			Enough of this foolishness. Let's
			get down to business.

	He turns the sack upside down and a pile of gold bars
	spills out across the tabletop.

					GOSS
			I'll match anyone's best offer...
			and add the gold on top of it.

	He holds out his hands in a fait accomplit motion.
	Sits back in his chair, with a confident grin. Bhavani
	reacts, nonplussed. Picard EXITS...

11   OUTSIDE THE DOOR - CLOSEUP

	a beat as the doors slide closed behind him and his
	eyes look skyward with a my-God reaction...

12   INT. TROI'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	She is studying personnel files of O'Brien and his
	girlfriend... but her mind drifts for a moment and she
	smiles to herself...

					TROI
			Computer... show me the file on
			delegate Devinoni Ral...

	On her screen, a very good picture of Ral appears with
	a read out...

12   CONTINUED:

					COMPUTER
			Devinoni Ral, human, age forty-one,

	There is a chime at the door... she presses a button to
	pause the readout...

					TROI
			Come in.

	The doors slide open to reveal Devinoni... she reacts.
	He ENTERS, smiles...

					DEVINONI
			Should I call for an
			appointment... ?

					TROI
			No... I... was just looking over
			some personnel files...

	Which she casually clears off the screen...

					DEVINONI
			Too bad. I had hoped you might
			be thinking about... me.

	Which of course she was. She smiles...

					TROI
			I thought you'd be deep into
			negotiations by now...

					DEVINONI
			In recess. I never play the
			opening rounds, anyway.
			Inconsequential.

	He sits on her desk, looking down at her.

					DEVINONI
			Besides there are more interesting
			things to negotiate on this ship.
			Like dinner tonight?

					TROI
			What about your... traveling
			companion?

      STAR TREK: "The Price" - REV. 9/25/89 - ACT ONE      13.

12   CONTINUED: (2)

					DEVINONI
			My traveling companion... is

				(off her look)
			I sent her home.

					TROI
			Why?

					DEVINONI
			You know why.

	She does. Almost as a defense mechanism...

					TROI
			Weren't you getting along?

					DEVINONI
			Don't do that.

					TROI
			What?

					DEVINONI
			Don't do "Counselor" Troi.

					TROI
			Was I?

					DEVINONI
				(nods, beat)
			When you leave this office, who
			are you?

	She reacts. How do you answer a question like that?

					DEVINONI
				(an insight about her)
			Oh. So that's how it is.

	He stands... studying her... moving around her chair...

					DEVINONI
			You never do. You never leave
			the office.

	He hits home. Uncannily. He's behind her now... his
	hands are in her hair... what the hell?

					TROI
			What are you...

      STAR TREK: "The Price" - REV. 9/26/89 - ACT ONE      14.

12   CONTINUED: (3)

					DEVINONI
			Ssshh...

	His fingers begin to unpin her hair... and we begin a
	ballet of long hair and fingers and hands in constant
	motion --

13   HER HAIR

	cascading free...

14   HIS HAND

	guiding the long strands down the back of her neck...
	stroking it... moving it...

15   HER HAND

	moving hair out of her eyes... finding his hand which
	takes hers... and turns her in...

16   THE SWIVEL CHAIR - REAR ANGLE

	long hair flowing over the back of the chair to face...

17   HER FACE

	twisting to meet...

18   HIS FACE

	and he takes her hair in both hands and moves it away
	from her mouth... and everything says he's going to
	kiss her but he doesn't...

					DEVINONI
			Dinner at eight?

	A quick gentle grin... and he's gone... we stay on
	Troi's face... we can hear the doors hiss open and
	closed... and Troi suddenly looks down and we move to
	find as she realizes her hands are gripping the arms of
	her chair as though she's on a perilous ride. And she
	is.

					PICARD
			It would take us nearly a century

					DATA
			The same distance could be

	Riker groans. Off their looks...

					RIKER
			I was just imagining the Ferengi

					MENDOZA
			I don't think the Ferengi are the

			with all of DaiMon Goss' bluster,
			they don't have the resources the
			Barzans need.

					RIKER
			I'd say that fellow Devinoni's

			Poker, isn't that a game of some

					MENDOZA
			Our skills are not dissimilar,

					PICARD
			Mister Mendoza, if this lives up
			to its billing... it is a

					RIKER
			Wormholes are here one moment,
			gone the next... a stable wormhole
			is unheard of.

					MENDOZA
				(reacts)
			Are you saying this may not be
			what it seems?

					DATA
			The Barzans do not have manned
			space travel, so they had to
			resort to an automated probe.
			Its findings are limited. It
			cannot be determined from these

					RIKER
			Geordi has continuous visual

			For what reasons, Leyor?

			It has been made very clear that

			Leyor, the Federation would like

			My apologies. We have already

	As the door opens to reveal Troi. She reacts as she
	sees...

87   REVERSE - DEVINONI

	A look.

					TROI
			Come in...

88   INT. TROI'S QUARTERS

					TROI
			When do you leave?

					DEVINONI
			Soon. I've... been recalled by
			the Chrysalians... explanations
			demanded and so forth.

					TROI
			I'm sorry.

					DEVINONI
				(shrugs)
			I've done all right for them over
			the years... they know the stakes.
			It'll be fine.

	They look at each other a long beat. "Fine" is not in
	their faces.

					DEVINONI
			I had to do it, Troi...

	Troi looks at him... can't accept that...

88   CONTINUED:

					DEVINONI
			Bhavani was ready to go with the
			the Federation. I sensed it.
			And I'd used up every card in the
			deck... I had to change the rules.

					TROI
			You must have known that I
			couldn't allow you to do that...

					DEVINONI
				(beat, grins)
			My human physical response must
			have blocked out my Betazoid
			senses.

	She knows, acknowledges.

					DEVINONI
				(beat)
			In a way, I'm glad you did it.
			It's made me take a hard look at
			who I am. I don't like what I
			see.

	He moves to her... she allows it.

					DEVINONI
			Deanna... I once asked you to
			run away with me. I'm asking you
			again. I need you. You could
			help me change. You could be my
			conscience.

	He kisses her. After they break...

					TROI
			I already have a job as a
			counselor.

88   CONTINUED: (2)

	He reacts. He slowly retreats to the door, shrugs...
	and EXITS. On her expression, with no regrets, we...

									FADE OUT.
