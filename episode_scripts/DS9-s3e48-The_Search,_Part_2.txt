                 Recap of "The Search, Part I"                  

1    EXT. LAKESHORE - NIGHT (OPTICAL)

	We pick up the action moments after the conclusion of part 
	one.  (Note: We see the shuttle in the background.)

	The FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER, and her three companions continue 
	to regard ODO with benign serenity.  KIRA stands beside him, 
	a smile slowly widening across her face.  For a moment she's 
	able to put aside her concern for Sisko and the other crew 
	members of the Defiant, happy that Odo's long search is 
	finally over.  As for Odo, he displays little emotion as he 
	intently scrutinizes the Shape-shifters standing before him.

					ODO
			You really are just like me, aren't 
			you?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Yes.

					ODO
				(gazing around him)
			And this is where I'm from?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			This is your home.

					ODO
			I wish I could remember it.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's understandable that you cannot.  
			You were still newly formed when you 
			left us.

					ODO
			"Newly formed?" You mean I was an 
			infant?

	The Female Shape-shifter takes a moment to think this over.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - TEASER           2.

1    CONTINUED:

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			An infant, yes.

					ODO
			I suspected as much.
				(a beat)
			Tell me do I have... any family at 
			all?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Of course.

					ODO
			I'd like to meet them.  If that's 
			possible.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(indicates the other 
				Shape-shifters)
			You already have.  We are all part 
			of the great link.

2    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	The Female Shape-shifter gestures toward the GELATINOUS LAKE.  
	Odo gazes out at it.

					ODO
			Is that all of us, or are there 
			others?

3    INCLUDE KIRA

	who senses Odo's having trouble dealing with the situation.

					KIRA
			Odo, this isn't a police 
			investigation.

					ODO
			I'm aware of that, Major.

					KIRA
			Then stop interrogating these people.  
			You've waited your whole life for 
			this moment, the least you can do is 
			try and enjoy it.
				(to the shape-shifters)
			He really is happy to be here.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - TEASER           3.

3    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(to Odo)
			Aren't you?

					ODO
				(somewhat abashed)
			Yes.  Of course.
				(to the shape-shifters)
			It's just... this is all very 
			sudden...

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(smiling)
			And you have many questions.


					ODO
			Yes.
				(has to know)
			What exactly is this great link?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			The link is the very foundation of 
			our society.  It provides a meaning 
			to our existence.  It is the merging 
			of thought and form.  The sharing of 
			idea and sensation.

	It all sounds uncomfortably intimate to Odo.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(noticing his reaction)
			Is something wrong?

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - TEASER           4.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			I've lived a very solitary life.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			That's... unfortunate.  But necessary 
			as you'll learn in time.  But now 
			that part of your life is over, you're 
			home.

	She extends her hand to Odo.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Female)
			What are you doing?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Take it.

	Odo hesitates.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			But it's not time.  He isn't ready.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(still looking at Odo)
			He's been gone too long.  He needs 
			to remember.  If only for a moment.
				(to Odo; re: her hand)
			Don't be afraid.

4    OMITTED

5    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Odo reaches out, clasps her hand, which MORPHS together with 
	his into their natural liquid state.  Odo is transfixed.  A 
	beat and then the Female Shape-shifter breaks the grasp and 
	their hands MORPH back into humanoid form, leaving Odo in 
	somewhat of a trance.

					KIRA
			Odo... Odo?
				(to Female Shape-shifter)
			What did you do to him?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I allowed him to experience the link.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - TEASER           5.

5    CONTINUED:

	Kira shakes Odo slightly, trying to bring him back from 
	wherever he's gone.

					KIRA
			Odo...

	Odo gazes over at Kira.  He's back.

					ODO
			Yes, Major.

					KIRA
			Are you all right?  What happened?

					ODO
			I'm not sure.  But I know one thing... 
			they're right.  I am home.

	And for the first time in a long while, Odo smiles.

									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

6    INT. SHUTTLE

	SISKO'S in the pilot's seat.  BASHIR, eyes closed, is slumped 
	in seat behind him.  Both men are clearly the worse for wear.

	Sisko works the companel, then pauses a moment to collect 
	his thoughts.

					SISKO
			Commander's Log, supplemental.  It's 
			been six days since we were forced 
			to abandon the Defiant during the 
			Jem'Hadar attack.  We still don't 
			know what happened to the rest of 
			the crew.  Doctor Bashir and I have 
			plotted a course back to the wormhole 
			but whether our shuttle can get us 
			there is questionable at best.  Our 
			engines are failing, our external 
			sensors are barely functioning and 
			life support systems are at twenty 
			percent and dropping.

					BASHIR
				(eyes still closed)
			But other than that we couldn't be 
			in better shape.

	He opens his eyes and smiles over at Sisko.

					SISKO
			I thought you were sleeping.

					BASHIR
			From the sound of things I wish I 
			were.

					SISKO
			Things could be worse.

	Suddenly the ship is jolted to a halt.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT ONE          7.

6    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			I believe you.

	Sisko checks his panel.

					BASHIR
			You think it's some kind of tractor 
			beam?

					SISKO
			Could be.  I wish these sensors were 
			working.

	The ship is jarred again.  This time there's a LOUD METALLIC 
	CLANGING as if something has just attached itself to the 
	shuttle's hull.

					BASHIR
			Now what?

	As if in answer the back hatch begins to open.

	Both Sisko and Bashir pull phasers which they point at the 
	hatch.

					SISKO
				(continuing)
			Wait until you have a clear shot.

					BASHIR
			Right.

	They wait tensely as the hatch slides open.

7    NEW ANGLE

	As O'BRIEN and DAX appear in the hatchway.  They react to 
	the weapons pointed in their direction.  (Note: Behind them 
	we see the shuttle has been brought into a Federation 
	shuttlebay.)

					O'BRIEN
				(smiling)
			Don't shoot.  We surrender.

	Sisko and Bashir break into grins.

					SISKO
			Chief... Dax.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT ONE          8.

7    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			I don't believe it.  We thought you'd 
			been captured by the Jem'Hadar.

					DAX
			We had our doubts about ever seeing 
			you again either, Julian.

					O'BRIEN
			We've been searching for you for 
			days.

					SISKO
			What about the others?

					DAX
				(a beat; not hopeful)
			No sign of them yet.  But we still 
			have ships out looking for them.

					O'BRIEN
			Meanwhile, our orders are to get you 
			back to D.S. Nine as soon as possible.

					DAX
			Big things are going on there 
			Benjamin.  I think you're in for a 
			surprise.

	And off an intrigued Sisko...

8    EXT. SPACE - THE SHAPE-SHIFTER'S DARK WORLD (OPTICAL)

9    EXT. CEREMONIAL GARDEN

	An alien equivalent to a Japanese rock garden, meant to invoke 
	tranquility among its visitors.  Its pathways are filled 
	with a variety of plants, rocks and benches, providing a wide 
	range of shapes and textures.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT ONE          9.

9    CONTINUED:

	Kira examines the landscape with wonder, but Odo is 
	oblivious to the loveliness surrounding him.  His gaze is 
	off in the distance as if impatiently waiting someone's 
	arrival.

					KIRA
				(re: the garden)
			This is beautiful.

					ODO
				(edgy)
			How long do they plan on making us 
			wait here.

					KIRA
			It's only been a few hours.

	Odo harumphs.

					ODO
			I finally return home and I'm still 
			treated like an outsider.

					KIRA
			Believe me, you're not the outsider 
			here.  I am.

					ODO
			You?

					KIRA
			I'm the one they don't trust, not 
			you.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (O.S.)
			How perceptive, Major.

10   NEW ANGLE

	Kira turns to find the Female Shape-shifter entering the 
	garden.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			If our history has taught us anything 
			it's to avoid contact with Solids 
			whenever possible.

					KIRA
			Solids?

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT ONE         10.

10   CONTINUED:

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Our name for mono-forms like yourself, 
			who'll never know the joys of the 
			great link.

					KIRA
			Well, Odo hasn't been able to "avoid 
			contact" with us and he hasn't done 
			too badly.

					ODO
			I doubt Starfleet Command would agree 
			with you, Major.

	The Female Shape-shifter is aware she's discovered a source 
	of tension between Odo and Kira.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Odo)
			Have you enjoyed living among the 
			Solids?

					ODO
			At times... though I never really 
			felt at home with them.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(smiling)
			That's because your home is with us.
				(to Kira)
			Unfortunately, I can't say the same 
			about you.  We have no place for 
			you here.

					KIRA
			I don't intend to be staying long.
				(to Odo)
			There's a chance Sisko and the others 
			survived the attack.  I'll try 
			contacting them from the shuttle.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'm sorry, but we cannot allow any 
			communications to be sent from the 
			planet's surface.  They could be 
			traced back here.
				(a beat)
			We value our isolation.

	Anxious to avoid an argument, Odo answers for Kira.

					ODO
			Yes, of course.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT ONE         11.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Odo looks to Kira who nods in agreement.  Satisfied, the 
	Female Shape-shifter gives Kira a dismissive glance and turns 
	her attentions to Odo.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(pleasantly)
			Tell me, Odo, have you made good use 
			of our arboretum?

					ODO
				(not sure what she 
				means)
			In what way?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(surprised by his 
				response)
			By assuming the various shapes 
			surrounding you.

					ODO
			Why would I do that?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(as if explaining to 
				a child)
			To become a thing is to know a thing.  
			To assume its form... is to begin to 
			understand its existence.

					ODO
			Understand it?  How?

	A beat.  The Female Shape-shifter studies Odo with sadness 
	and sympathy.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT ONE         12.

10   CONTINUED:	(3)

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Living among the Solids has damaged 
			you far worse than I realized.  It 
			has left you ignorant of the gifts 
			you possess.

					ODO

				(humbled)
			Then teach me what I need to know.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'll do what I can.  But in the end, 
			this is another journey you must 
			make on your own.  And when it's 
			over you will be ready to take your 
			place in the great link.

	She reaches down and picks up a rock which she places in 
	Odo's hand.  Then she turns and walks out of the garden...

11   NEW ANGLE

	A stricken Odo watches her go.

					KIRA
				(gently)
			Odo.

					ODO
			I'd like to be alone if you don't 
			mind.

					KIRA
				(understanding)
			All right.  If you need me, I'll be 
			in the shuttle trying to contact 
			Sisko.
				(off Odo's reaction)
			Don't worry, when I was in the 
			resistance I learned to camouflage 
			subspace messages with quantum 
			interference.  I taught the method 
			to Commander Sisko.  If anyone 
			intercepts the signal all they'll 
			read is a slight elevation in 
			background radiation.

	Odo trusts that Kira knows what she's doing.

					ODO
			Good luck.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/22/94 - ACT ONE         13.

11   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			You too.

	She leaves.

	HOLD on Odo as he contemplates the rock he holds in his hand.

12   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	The airlock slides open as Sisko and Bashir EXIT, followed 
	by O'Brien and Dax.

13   NEW ANGLE

	To include ADMIRAL NECHEYEV, who grants Sisko a rare smile.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/22/94 - ACT ONE         14.


13   CONTINUED:

					NECHEYEV
			Well, Commander, it appears your 
			mission was an even greater success 
			than we hoped.

					SISKO
			So I'm told.  Has the delegation 
			from the Founders arrived on the 
			station yet?

					NECHEYEV
			They're already meeting with 
			representatives from the Federation 
			Council and a dozen other Alpha 
			Quadrant alliances.  We're hoping to 
			have a treaty signed within a matter 
			of days.  And we have you to thank 
			for it.

	Sisko, Necheyev and the others start down the hall.

					SISKO
			It's Lieutenant Dax and Chief O'Brien 
			who deserve most of the credit.

					O'BRIEN
			We were lucky the Jem'Hadar turned 
			us over to the Founders.

					DAX
			We just had to convince them all 
			that we were serious about peace.

					O'BRIEN
			Actually, it didn't take much 
			convincing.

					SISKO
			I suppose the only question is, can 
			we trust them?

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT ONE         15.

13   CONTINUED:	(2)

					NECHEYEV
			It's a risk, I know.  But both the 
			Federation Council and Starfleet 
			Command believe it's one worth taking.
				(a beat)
			By the way, Commander, one of the 
			Founders asked to see you the moment 
			you arrived on the station.

					SISKO
				(surprised)
			Asked to see me?

					NECHEYEV
			If you're not too busy.

					SISKO
				(intrigued)
			I think I can spare a few minutes.

14   INT. CREW QUARTERS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

	Sisko and Necheyev come around the corner.

					NECHEYEV
			I know we've had our differences 
			Ben, but I want you to know what a 
			fine job I think you...

15   NEW ANGLE

	As Sisko stops at the sight of a Jem'Hadar SOLDIER guarding 
	the corridor.

					NECHEYEV
			It's all right, Commander.  The 
			Founders have asked that the Jem'Hadar 
			handle security for them during their 
			visit.

					SISKO
			Is that so?

					NECHEYEV
			If these talks were being held in 
			the Gamma Quadrant we'd want our 
			security people along.

17   NEW ANGLE

	As BORATH, a male Founder, turns from the window.  (The

	Jem'Hadar").

					BORATH
			Commander Sisko, come in.  I've looked 
			forward to meeting you.  I am Borath.

					SISKO
			And you're one of the Founders?

					BORATH
			That's correct.  You seem surprised.

					SISKO
			Not really.  Only I hadn't realized 
			until now that I've already met one 
			of your people.

					BORATH
			You're referring to Eris, of course.  
			Yes, she's one of us.  Though she 
			couldn't very well admit it while 
			you were pointing a phaser at her.  
			I'm glad to see you're not holding 
			one now.

					SISKO
			Do I need one?

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT ONE        16A.

			Not at all.

	Sisko doesn't seem convinced.

					BORATH
				(continuing)
			You seem skeptical.

					SISKO
			Can you blame me?

					BORATH
			No.  I realize you have no reason to 
			trust the Dominion.  But you must 
			understand we were only trying to 
			defend ourselves.

					SISKO
			From what?

					BORATH
			We felt threatened by your incursions 
			into the Gamma Quadrant.

					SISKO
			And now?

					BORATH
			Commander, you risked your life to 
			bring us a message of peace and 
			friendship.  We chose to accept your 
			offer.  Would you rather we refused?

	A beat.  Sisko has to admit he's got him there.

					SISKO
			No.

			Good.  Because believe me, Commander,

			the Federation will be beneficial to 
			both our people.

18   HOLD ON SISKO

	It's a lovely sentiment, but he's still having a hard time 
	buying into it.

19   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	Bashir is walking past the crossover bridge when GARAK spots 
	him and approaches.

					GARAK
			Doctor, welcome back.

					BASHIR
			Thank you, Garak.  It's good to be 
			back.
				(a beat)
			Business keeping you busy?

					GARAK
			You mean the tailoring business, or 
			the spy business?
				(off Bashir's reaction)
			I'm joking, of course.

					BASHIR
			Of course.

	The men continue walking.

					GARAK
			I've missed you, Doctor.  I admit I 
			was very concerned for your safety.  
			Lunch just hasn't been the same 
			without you.

					BASHIR
			That's very kind of you to say, Garak.  
			Hopefully things can start getting 
			back to normal around here.

					GARAK
			Oh, I doubt that's going to happen 
			Doctor.  I doubt that very much.

					BASHIR
			And why is that?

					GARAK
			There's an old saying on Cardassia, 
			"Enemies make dangerous friends."  
			And I fear the Dominion is going to 
			make a very dangerous friend indeed.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT TWO        20A.

19   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			I take it you're referring to the 
			peace talks.

					GARAK
			Exactly.
				(a beat)
			I'm afraid these treaty negotiations 
			are a mistake we'll live to regret.

					BASHIR
			Is that your opinion or the opinion 
			of the Cardassian Central Command?

	They start down the stairs to the first level of the 
	Promenade.

					GARAK
			The former I assure you.  The Central 
			Command is very much in favor of 
			this treaty.  Which, as far as I'm 
			concerned, only justifies my fears.

19A  INT. PROMENADE

	as Bashir and Garak step off the stairs onto the first level.

					BASHIR
			Well I, for one, hope you're worrying 
			about nothing...

19B  NEW ANGLE

	SUB-COMMANDER T'RUL EXITS the Infirmary.  A small bandage 
	covers a wound on her hand.

					BASHIR
			Sub-Commander T'Rul, are you all 
			right?

					T'RUL
			I'm fine.  I had a minor disagreement 
			with some Starfleet security officers.  
			They refused to allow me to speakwith 
			the Federation's negotiating team.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT TWO        20B.

19B  CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			What did you want to talk to them 
			about?

					T'RUL
			I wanted to protest the exclusion of 
			the Romulan Empire from the treaty 
			negotiations.

					BASHIR
			I wasn't aware the Romulans had been 
			excluded.

					T'RUL
			Every great power in the Alpha 
			Quadrant has been invited to 
			participate except for us.

					BASHIR
			There must be some mistake.

					T'RUL
			The mistake is thinking the Romulan 
			empire will stand by and allow such 
			a betrayal to go unchallenged.  
			Believe me Doctor, if a treaty is 
			signed without our approval, it will 
			mean war.

	And with that T'Rul storms away.

					GARAK
			Still feel I'm worrying about nothing, 
			Doctor?

	Bashir isn't quite so sure anymore.

20   INT. SHUTTLE

21   NEW ANGLE

	As a somber Odo ENTERS the shuttle.

					ODO
			Any luck, Major?

					KIRA
			There's some kind of power source

					ODO
			I haven't a clue.

	Kira studies Odo.  His depression is palpable.

					KIRA
			Are you all right?

					ODO
			I've just spent the last two hours 
			shape-shifting.  Rocks, flowers, 
			trees... I've been everything in 
			that garden.

					KIRA
			And?

					ODO
			And nothing.  Oh, I can become a 
			rock all right,  but I have no more 
			of an idea what it's like to be a 
			rock than I did before.

22   EXT. LAKESHORE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER (OPTICAL)

	Kira stands before the lake of shape-shifters.

				(a beat)
			Can anyone hear me?

	We hold on Kira as we hear a MORPH SOUND EFFECTS cue then --

22A  NEW ANGLE

	To reveal the male Shape-shifter standing behind her.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			We hear you, Major.  But please be 
			brief.  We find the humanoid shape 
			to be... awkward.

					KIRA
			I won't keep you long.  It's about 
			Odo.  He needs your help.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			How would you have us help him?

					KIRA
			By talking to him... telling him 
			what he needs to know.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			In time all his questions will be 
			answered.

					KIRA
			And when will that be?

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT TWO         23.

22A  CONTINUED:

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER

					KIRA
			And you'll be the ones to decide

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Who better?  After all, he's one of 
			us.  We know him.

					KIRA
			I "know him" too.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Do you?

					KIRA
			I'm his friend.

	The male Shape-shifter steps closer to Kira, and when he speaks 
	it is with a cold animosity.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			You're a solid.  All you have ever 
			done is teach him how to be like 
			you.

					KIRA
			That's not true.

					MALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Isn't it?  If you really cared about 
			your friend you'd stop interfering 
			and let us do what's best for him.
				(a beat)
			It's time you went home, Major.  Odo

26   NEW ANGLE

	As Necheyev ENTERS.

					NECHEYEV
			You asked to see me, Commander?

					SISKO
			I understand that the Romulans haven't 
			been invited to the peace talks.

					NECHEYEV
			That's correct.

					SISKO
			I was wondering what prompted that 
			decision.

					NECHEYEV
			The Founders requested that they be 
			excluded.

					SISKO
			Did they say why?

					NECHEYEV
			They felt the Romulans would be a 
			disruptive influence.

					SISKO
			More disruptive than the Cardassians?

					NECHEYEV
			They seemed to think so.  Do you 
			have a problem with this, Commander?

	Sisko rises from his seat.

          DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT TWO         25.

26   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Whether I have a problem with it 
			isn't the point.  It's the Romulans 
			we have to worry about.

					NECHEYEV
			Commander, if this treaty is signed, 
			and I'm confident it will be, we'll 
			never have to worry about the Romulans 
			again.

					SISKO
			You're sure of that.

					NECHEYEV
			Quite sure.  After all, what chance 
			would they have against the combined 
			power of our new alliance?

					SISKO
				(has to admit it)
			They wouldn't have much of a chance 
			at all.

					NECHEYEV
			I'm glad we agree.  Believe me, 
			Commander, the Federation carefully 
			weighed all the options before 
			entering into these peace talks.

					SISKO
			I realize that.

					NECHEYEV
			Then we have nothing further to 
			discuss, do we?

	The Female Shape-shifter is seated before an ornate water

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(addressing the

			That's very good, Odo.  Now don't

					ODO
			Why do you dislike humanoids so much?  
			I know they have their flaws, but

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Like Major Kira?

					ODO
			Yes, like Major Kira.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Then you've been more fortunate than 
			most changelings.

	Odo is surprised to hear her use that name.

					ODO
			Changelings?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			You recognize the term.

					ODO
			I've been called a changeling on 
			occasion.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's a name given to us by the Solids.  
			They meant it as an insult, but in 
			defiance we took it and made it our 
			own.

	A beat.  Odo presses her to continue.

					ODO
			Go on... please.

	She hesitates but is unable to refuse Odo's need for answers.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			The great link tells us that long 
			ago our people used to roam the stars, 
			searching out other races, so that 
			we could add to our knowledge of the 
			galaxy.  We went in peace, but too 
			often we were met with suspicion,

31   CONTINUED:	(2)

			And here...
				(a beat)
			... safe in our isolation we made our 
			home.

					ODO
			Tell me... why was I sent away?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Because even in our solitude we 
			desired to learn more about the

			"infants" we sent off to gain that 
			knowledge for us.

					ODO
			But how could you be sure we'd find 
			our way back here?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			You had no choice.  The urge to return 
			home was implanted in your genetic 
			makeup.
				(smiling)
			And now, thanks to the passageway, 
			you're the first to return to us.  
			We were not expecting you so soon.

					ODO
			When were you expecting me?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Not for another three hundred years.

	She tentatively reaches out and takes his hand.  They stare

					BASHIR
			I know what the orders say.  But he

					EDDINGTON
			I'm aware of station regulations,

			not.  We have to allow them some

					BASHIR

			And in the meantime, they're free to

					EDDINGTON
			Remember that before you get into

	Eddington nods to the other Security Officer and together

			Dad?

					SISKO

			Yes, Jake.

			Oh.

	He hands over the bowl.

					JAKE
			Dad is something wrong?

					SISKO
			Not really.  I'm just a little 
			preoccupied that's all.  It's these 
			Dominion negotiations...

					JAKE
			What about them?

					SISKO
			It's all happening behind closed 
			doors.  I guess I feel like I've 
			been cut out of the loop.

					JAKE
				(probing)
			No, it's more than that.  There's 
			something going on, isn't there?

	Sisko finds Jake's response odd.

					SISKO
			Like what?

					JAKE
			You tell me.

	Sisko isn't sure what Jake's fishing for, but before he can 
	ask, the door CHIMES.

					SISKO
			Come in.

	He takes the PADD from her.  Reads it.

					SISKO

43   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(not interested)
			I want to know why my Science

					NECHEYEV
			Are you finished?

					SISKO
			I haven't even begun.

					BORATH
			Admiral, I think you should tell 
			Commander Sisko what he wants to 
			know.

	Necheyev thinks about it for a moment before answering.

					NECHEYEV
			All right.  I suppose he deserves to 
			be the first to hear the news.

					SISKO
			What news?

					NECHEYEV
			The Federation is pulling out of 
			this sector.  All Starfleet personnel 
			currently stationed on D.S. Nine 
			will be reassigned to other posts.  
			Yourself included.

					SISKO
				(stunned)
			What about Bajor?

					NECHEYEV
			Our plans for Bajor are on hold for 
			the time being.  From now on Bajor 
			will be the Dominion's responsibility.  
			They'll be running this station.

					SISKO
				(incredulous)
			Are you telling me the Bajorans have

					BORATH
			We're confident they'll have no

					SISKO
			And if they do object, what then?  
			You send in the Jem'Hadar?

					BORATH
			The Jem'Hadar are used only against 
			our enemies.
				(a beat)
			Bajor will be protected, Commander.  
			We'll see to it.

					SISKO
				(to Necheyev)
			What about the wormhole?  Do they 
			get to protect that too?

					NECHEYEV
			It's the price of peace, Benjamin.

					SISKO
			Well, if you ask me the price is too 
			damn high.  What's the Federation 
			supposed to get out of all this?

					BORATH
			Our friendship.  Isn't that enough?

					NECHEYEV
			And you Benjamin, get a promotion.
				(a beat)
			Captain Sisko.  That's an important 
			step toward that Admiralcy you've 
			always wanted.

	But Sisko isn't interested in promotions at the moment.

					SISKO
			Admiral, I'd like a chance to speak 
			to the Federation negotiating team 
			before this treaty is signed.

				(smiling)

					KIRA
				(a greeting)
			Odo, I've been waiting for you...

					ODO
				(interrupting)
			Major, I just had the most...

					KIRA
			I'm happy for you.

					ODO
			I know you are.

					KIRA
			So, I guess you'll be staying here a

			Remember that power source I was

			The one preventing you from trying

					KIRA
			Well, I've found it.

					ODO
			And what did it turn out to be?

					KIRA
			I couldn't tell.  There's a door

			help me get it open.

					ODO
			What kind of door?

					KIRA
			It's composed of some kind of metal 
			the tricorder couldn't identify.  
			But other than that it's an ordinary 
			door.

	Odo puzzles that one over.

					ODO
			That's odd.  My people have no need

					SISKO
			Thank you, Mister Garak.

					GARAK
			Oh, I'm sure you'll be back before

			I've heard the same rumors.  That 
			Bajor has forged a pact with the

				(a beat)
			And their allies.

					GARAK
			The Bajorans have fought for their

					SISKO
			So much for my "peace" mission.

					GARAK
			Do I detect a note of bitterness in

					SISKO
			I wouldn't be surprised.

					GARAK
			If it makes you feel better, I happen

				(a beat)
			I've given it a great deal of thought,

					ODO
			I don't understand.  You knew about 
			this?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Yes.

					ODO
			But how could you allow it?

	Kira thinks she knows the answer.

					KIRA
				(to Female Shape-shifter)
			You belong to the Dominion, don't 
			you?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Belong to it?  Major, the changelings 
			are the Dominion.

	And now it becomes all too clear to Odo.

					ODO
			You're the Founders.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(proudly)
			Ironic isn't it, that the hunted now 
			control the destinies of hundreds of 
			other races.

					ODO
			But why "control" anyone?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Because what you control can't hurt 
			you.  So, many years ago we set 
			ourselves the task of imposing order 
			on a chaotic universe.

					KIRA
				(scornfully)
			Imposing order?  Is that what you 
			call it?  I call it murder.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			What you call it is no concern of 
			ours.

					ODO
				(bewildered)
			But how do you justify the deaths of 
			so many people?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			The Solids have always been a threat 
			to us.  That's all the justification 
			we need.

					ODO
				(re: Sisko and the 
				others)
			But these Solids have never harmed 
			you.  They travel the galaxy looking 
			to expand their knowledge.  The same 
			as you once did.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			The Solids are nothing like us.

	Odo regards the Female Shape-shifter with an infinite sadness.

					ODO
			No, I suppose they're not.
				(a beat)
			And neither am I.
				(a beat)
			I've devoted my life to the pursuit 
			of justice.  But justice means nothing 
			to you, does it?.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's not justice you desire, Odo, 
			it's order.  The same as we do.  And 
			we can help you satisfy that desire 
			in ways the Solids never could.
				(a beat)
			This will all become clear to you 
			once you've taken your place in the 
			great link.

					ODO
				(quietly firm)
			No.

         DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT FIVE         60.

74   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
				(a beat)
			I admit this link of yours is... 
			enticing.  But you see, I've already 
			formed a link... with these people.
				(to Borath re: Sisko 
				and the others)
			I want you to remove those devices, 
			then bring them their combadges.

	Borath looks to the Female Shape-shifter for guidance.

					BORATH
				(to Female Shape-shifter)
			We can't allow them to leave.

					ODO
				(to Female Shape-shifter)
			And I can't allow you to keep them 
			here.  They're leaving and so am I.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It took you many years to find your 
			way back home.  Are you really willing 
			to leave it again so soon?

					ODO
			Unless you intend to stop me.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			No changeling has ever harmed another.

					ODO
				(hard)
			Until now.  Because whatever you do 
			to them you're going to have to do 
			to me.

	A beat as the Female Shape-shifter studies Odo.  Then she 
	turns to Borath.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			They're free to go.

	Borath hesitates.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(coldly)
			Do you question my decision?

         DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT FIVE         61.

74   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BORATH
				(humbly)
			The Vorta serve the Founders, in all 
			things.

	Borath and the other Vorta begin removing the devices from 
	their prisoners.

					ODO
				(to Female Shape-shifter)
			Thank you.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Sisko and the 
				prisoners)
			Next time, I promise you, we will 
			not be so generous.

	Sisko and the others begin to stir as if waking from a deep 
	sleep.

					SISKO
				(groggy)
			Constable?

					O'BRIEN
			What happened to the Rio Grande?

					DAX
			The last thing I remember is 
			collapsing the wormhole.

					T'RUL
			The last thing I remember is being 
			shot by some Jem'Hadar soldier.

					KIRA
			I'm sure it all seemed very real, 
			but the truth is, you've been held 
			in this room ever since the Jem'Hadar 
			brought you here from the Defiant.

	Borath hands them their combadges.  He hates letting them 
	go, but has to follow his orders.

					SISKO
			Borath?
				(to Kira)
			What the hell is going on here?

					BORATH
			Your ship is in orbit.  You may 
			transport to it whenever you're ready.

         DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT FIVE         62.

74   CONTINUED:	(4)

	Before Sisko can protest...

					ODO
			Return to the Defiant, Commander.  
			I'll be along shortly.

					KIRA
				(to Sisko)
			Do as he says.  I'll stay down here 
			and see that he gets back to the 
			ship.

	By now the others are aware of the Female Shape-shifter.

					BASHIR
			It's another Shape-shifter.

					ODO
			Commander, you must leave now.  I 
			promise you I'll explain everything 
			later.

	Odo and Kira's urgent pleas are not lost on Sisko.  He trusts 
	their judgement enough to know if they say leave, it's best 
	to go.

					SISKO
			I'll look forward to it, Constable.

	Odo and Kira step away from the other crewmembers.

					SISKO
				(hits combadge)
			Sisko to Defiant.  Five to beam up.

75   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Sisko and the other crewmembers DEMATERIALIZE.  Odo and Kira 
	remain with the Shape-shifters.

76   OMITTED

77   EXT. LAKESHORE

	Odo and the Female Shape-shifter face each other near the 
	lake's edge.


         DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/18/94 - ACT FIVE        62A.

77   CONTINUED:

	Kira stands a respectful distance away.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I hope one day you'll return to us 
			Odo, and take your rightful place 
			within the Dominion.

         DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT FIVE         64.

78   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			I don't think that's possible.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Your link to the Solids won't last.  
			You'll always be an outsider.

					ODO
			Being an outsider isn't so bad.  It 
			gives you a unique perspective.  
			It's a pity you've forgotten that.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(with a smile)
			Then perhaps one day I'll come and 
			visit you.  The Alpha Quadrant seems 
			wracked with chaos.  It could use 
			some order.

					ODO
			Imposing you're brand of order on 
			the Alpha Quadrant may be more 
			difficult than you imagine.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			We're willing to wait until the time 
			is right.
				(with regret)
			We will miss you Odo.  But you will 
			miss us even more.

78   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	And with a final look of farewell she MORPHS back into the 
	lake.

	Odo stands alone by the lakeshore for a beat and then is 
	joined by Kira.

					KIRA
			Odo?

					ODO
			I'm ready Major.

         DEEP SPACE: "THE Search, II" - 07/19/94 - ACT FIVE         64.

78   CONTINUED:

	Kira reaches out and takes Odo's hand in hers.  He's 
	surprised and touched by the gesture.

					KIRA
				(hits combadge)
			Kira to Defiant.  Two to beam up.

	They DEMATERIALIZE.

79   INT. DEFIANT BRIDGE

	Odo and Kira walk in from the Corridor, having beamed in o.s.  
	Everyone's glad to see them.  Kira takes her seat.  Sisko 
	and Odo exchange a welcome nod.  Then Sisko turns to Dax at 
	the helm.

					SISKO
				(smiling)
			Take us home, Lieutenant.

					DAX
				(working helm)
			Yes, Sir.

					SISKO
				(to Odo)
			Constable, we have a lot to talk 
			about.

					ODO
			You're right Commander, we do.

80   CLOSE ON ODO

	Aware he's sacrificed his dreams of home.  But as painful as 
	that sacrifice is, he's still satisfied he's made the right 
	decision.

81   OMITTED

									FADE OUT.
