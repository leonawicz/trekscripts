	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - DEFIANT (OPTICAL)

	hanging in space near a KAREMMA SHIP. In the 
	background we see a gas-giant planet, and further back, 
	its sun.

					SISKO (V.O.) 
			Captain's Log, Stardate 49263.5. 
			At the request of the Karemma 
			Commerce Ministry, we've brought 
			the Defiant to a remote system in 
			the Gamma Quadrant to discuss 
			problems that have surfaced 
			regarding our recent trade 
			agreement.

2    INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL

	Where SISKO, QUARK and the Karemma Trade Minister, 
	HANOK are in the midst of negotiations. Hanok, like 
	most of his people, is tall, thin and elegant in 
	bearing. Although the Karemma are mercantilist by 
	nature, they're classy about it: think fine gem 
	appraiser, not used car salesman.

					HANOK 
				(to Sisko) 
			When we first agreed to use the 
			Ferengi as intermediaries, we did 
			it because we knew the Dominion 
			wouldn't tolerate direct trade 
			with the Federation.

	Quark can't help playing the booster...

					QUARK 
			And we're glad to be of service. 
			I'm happy to say that not a single
			Ferengi vessel has been stopped by 
			the Jem'Hadar.

	Hanok gives Quark a polite smile, continues to Sisko.

					HANOK 
			Unfortunately, we've found there's 
			little profit in trading with the 
			Federation.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/11/95 - TEASER      2.

2    CONTINUED:

					HANOK (Cont'd) 
			In order to comply with your 
			commerce laws, we've had to pay a 
			series of taxes and fees that have 
			made the cost of doing business 
			with you too high.

	Quark begins to look nervous; he's about to get busted, 
	and he has to start thinking fast.

					SISKO
			What sort of taxes and fees are 
			you referring to?

					HANOK 
				(off PADD) 
			For example... on a recent 
			shipment of Karemman Fleece, a 
			four percent surcharge was added 
			to pay for inspecting the cargo 
			for "changeling infiltrators."

					SISKO
			What?

	Quark tries to push past this with a "what can you do?" 
	smile.

					QUARK 
			You never know where they might be 
			hiding.

	As Hanok continues to reel off the list of problems, 
	Sisko begins to see what's going on here, and he 
	doesn't like it.

					HANOK 
			Another three percent of the 
			shipment's value was lost due to 
			"unforeseen" currency 
			fluctuations.

					QUARK 
			There was a run on the Bolian 
			Credit Exchange... played havoc 
			with the markets...

					HANOK 
			A six percent tariff was imposed 
			to help offset the "lost income of 
			Tarkalian sheep herders."

					QUARK
 			Hardworking people... you have to 
			feel for them...

DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/11/95 - TEASER      3.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

					HANOK
				(looking up)
			Should I go on, Captain... ?

					SISKO 
			No... I think you've made your 
			point...

	Sisko turns pointedly to Quark, who manages a wan 
	smile. OFF his face as he realizes how much trouble 
	he's in...

3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	WORF is in the Captain's chair, DAX and KIRA are at the 
	back table, and a few N.D.'s man the other consoles.

	A young Female Ensign, CARSON, approaches and gives 
	Worf a report on a PADD.

					CARSON
			These are the results of the last 
			weapons drill, sir.

	Worf looks it over.

					WORF
			These response times are not 
			acceptable, ensign.

	Carson is a bit flustered by Worf's tone, tries to explain.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - TEASER      4.

3    CONTINUED:

					CARSON 
			They are a little high, sir, but 
			not if you take into account the --

					WORF
				(interrupting) 
			I want these response times 
			brought down fifteen percent. 
			Schedule another drill.

					CARSON 
			Yes, sir.

	As she moves off, Dax and Kira exchange a look that 
	tells us they would've handled it differently.

	Dax has gotten some small PASTRIES from the aft 
	replicator, offers one to Kira.

					DAX 
			Want one?

					KIRA
				(shaking her head) 
			I'm fasting. Today is Ha'mara.

					DAX
			Ha'mara?

					KIRA 
			It's the anniversary of the 
			Emissary's arrival. We fast to 
			show the Prophets our gratitude 
			for sending him to us. Last 
			night, there was a Festival of 
			Lights in the Capital.

					DAX
			Sounds beautiful. I'm sorry we 
			missed it.

					KIRA 
			Something tells me the captain 
			scheduled these negotiations so he 
			wouldn't have to attend.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/15/95 - TEASER      5.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

	Dax hears the tinge of regret in Kira's voice...

					DAX 
			Benjamin's never been one for 
			ceremonies, especially where he's 
			the center of attention.
				(smiles) 
			Curzon threw him a surprise 
			birthday party once. What a 
			disaster.

					KIRA
			I understand how the captain 
			feels... but still, it would have 
			meant a lot if the Emissary could 
			have been there.

					DAX
			After being stuck in the mess hall 
			with Quark and Hanok all morning, 
			I bet he wishes he had gone.

	Suddenly a console BEEPS...

					CARSON
				(urgent) 
			Two ships have just entered sensor
			range...

					WORF
			Can you identify them?

					CARSON
				(works) 
			They're Jem'Hadar warships.

					WORF
			Red Alert.
				(to com) 
			Captain Sisko to the Bridge. All 
			hands to battle stations.

	Off the tension of the moment we...

									FADE OUT..

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

4    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	Where Sisko and Hanok are ENTERING to join Kira, Worf 
	and Dax, who has taken the helm.

					WORF
				(from tactical console) 
			The Jem'Hadar are powering their 
			weapons systems. They are 
			targeting the Karemma ship.

5    ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	where the TWO Jem'Hadar ships are bearing down.

6    RESUME SCENE

					HANOK 
			They're here to punish us for 
			meeting with you. If I give 
			myself up and accept full 
			responsibility, they might spare 
			my ship.

	Sisko is impressed with Hanok's gesture, but can't see 
	giving him up.

					SISKO 
			I'm not about to turn you over to 
			them.

    Sisko swings into action.

					SISKO
				(to Kira) 
			Open a channel.
				(to com) 
			This is Captain Benjamin Sisko of 
			the USS Defiant. Stand down or 
			we'll be forced to --

	Suddenly the ship is ROCKED by Jem'Hadar fire...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE      7.

6    CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			Return fire.

	We hear the SOUND of phasers firing.

					DAX 
			The Karemma. ship is coming 
			about... they're moving away, 
			Captain.

					SISKO
				(to Hanok) 
			Tell your people to hold position. 
			We can't protect them if they run.

	Hanok moves to Kira's console, but...

					KIRA 
			The Karemma aren't responding to 
			our hails.

					WORF 
			The Jem'Hadar are changing 
			course... they're going after the 
			Karemma ship.

					SISKO
			Move to intercept.

	Dax works her controls...

7    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Defiant is hot on the tail of the Jem'Hadar, firing 
	at both ships, who are right behind the Karemma ship 
	firing at her in turn.

	Suddenly the Karemma ship veers off and away, down 
	toward the surface of the gas giant hanging in space 
	nearby.

8    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

					DAX 
			What are they doing?

					HANOK 
			They must be gambling that the 
			Jem'Hadar won't follow them into 
			the atmosphere.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE      7.

8    CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			They'd be smart not to. 
			That's a Class-J gas giant. I'm 
			reading wind speeds of over ten 
			thousand kilometers per hour.

9    VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as the Karemma ship disappears into the planet's cloudy 
	surface, and a beat later, the Jem'Hadar ships plunge 
	in after it.

10   RESUME SCENE

	Sisko considers his options.

					HANOK 
			Twenty-three of my people are on 
			that ship... and they're going to 
			die because I was foolish enough 
			to defy the Dominion.

					SISKO
			They're not going to die, 
			Minister. Not if I can help it. 
				(to com) 
			Sisko to O'Brien.

								INTERCUT WITH:

11   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM 

	where O'Brien is working a console. Two young Enlisted 
	Engineers, MUNIZ and STEVENS, work other consoles. 
	N.D.s man the rest.

					O'BRIEN
				(to com) 
			Go ahead, sir.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE      9.

11   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			I'm taking the ship into the 
			atmosphere.

	Reactions.

					SISKO 
			I know it's not what she was built 
			for, but I think the ship can 
			handle it.

					O'BRIEN 
			Aye, sir. I'll see if I can get 
			more power to the Structural 
			Integrity Field.

								END INTERCUT ON:

12   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

					KIRA 
				(working) 
			Adjusting shield geometry for 
			atmospheric entry...

					WORF 
				(working)
			Transferring auxiliary power to 
			forward shields...

					SISKO 
				(to Dax) 
			Take us in.

					DAX
			Five seconds to atmosphere... 
			four... three...

	The ship SHUDDERS violently as it hits the atmosphere. 
	Suddenly we hear an unfamiliar SOUND: the ROAR of wind 
	slashing against the hull.

13   EXT. SPACE - DEFIANT (OPTICAL)

	As the Defiant descends through the atmosphere.

14   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	As before.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE     10.

14   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			There's so much interference our 
			imaging systems are practically 
			useless...

14A  VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as it FRITZES and goes to STATIC.

14B  RESUME SCENE

	Suddenly the ship LURCHES and SHAKES...

					DAX
			We've hit a cross-current!

					SISKO
			Head into it!

	Dax works, and after a beat, the ship stabilizes and 
	the shaking subsides somewhat, though every few moments 
	it might SHUDDER as it's buffeted by a blast of wind.

					KIRA 
			We've slipped between two thermal 
			layers... wind velocities are a 
			little more manageable here.

					SISKO
				(to Dax) 
			Hold this altitude. 
				(to Worf) 
			Any sign of the Karemma or the 
			Jem'Hadar?

					WORF 
			No, but sensor range is less than 
			two kilometers.

					DAX
			There might be a way we can 
			increase it.

	Dax moves to a side console, and Carson takes the helm.

					SISKO 
			Minister Hanok, I think it would 
			be best if you returned to the 
			mess hall.

					HANOK 
			As you wish, Captain.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE    10A.

14B  CONTINUED: 

	Sisko nods to an N.D, who escorts Hanok off the Bridge.

					SISKO 
			Mister Worf, what's our weapons 
			status?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE    10A.

14B  CONTINUED:	(2)

					WORF 
			The cloak is ineffective inside 
			this atmosphere. And the 
			interference will jam our torpedo 
			guidance systems.

					SISKO 
			What about phasers?

					WORF 
			We'll have to target them 
			manually.

	None of this is good news, but Sisko takes it in 
	stride. Kira and Dax turn to Sisko with a plan.

					DAX
			Benjamin, we have an idea.

					KIRA
			It's a little trick I learned
			during the occupation. We'd
			sometimes try to evade Cardassian
			ships by hiding in the Badlands.
			Sensor range was limited, so we
			learned to use an old active-scan
			system to navigate.

					DAX 
			It works by echo-location... we 
			send out a modulated tetrion 
			pulse, and if it reflects off the 
			hull of a ship, we can approximate 
			its location.

					SISKO 
			Won't these pulses give away our 
			position as well?

					KIRA 
				(nods) 
			We'll have to alter course and 
			speed after each one.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE     12.

14B  CONTINUED:	(3)

	Sisko nods that they get to work...

15   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL

	as Hanok ENTERS. Outside, we see the N.D. take up 
	position in the corridor to guard the door. The SOUND 
	of the wind outside is slightly less audible here. 
	Quark, who's been looking over a PADD, glances up and 
	immediately breaks into a smile...

					QUARK 
			Good news, Minister.

	Hanok regards him impassively.

					HANOK 
			Really?

					QUARK 
			I think I've found the problem.

	Quark crosses toward him with the PADD.

					QUARK 
			I made the mistake of letting my 
			brother Rom execute these 
			contracts.

					HANOK
				(skeptical) 
			Your brother?

					QUARK 
			Yes. I'm ashamed to say it, but 
			he's an idiot. You see, the 
			Federation and the Karemma have 
			very different laws governing 
			commerce, and I think that Rom 
			must've... gotten confused by all 
			the legalisms.

	Hanok looks unconvinced, but Quark is going to 
	try to salvage this deal if he can.

					QUARK 
			Now, I'm more than willing to make 
			up for any losses you might have 
			suffered. In fact, I'll pay them 
			back with interest.

	Hanok has had enough, cuts him off.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE     13.

15   CONTINUED:

					HANOK 
			You cheated me, Quark. And you 
			don't even have the courage to 
			admit it. If we survive this, 
			I'll see to it that you never do 
			business in the Gamma Quadrant 
			again...

	Off Quark's reaction...

16   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (VPB) 

	Where Kira, Dax and Sisko are looking at an OKUDAGRAM 
	on a side console. An icon representing the Defiant is 
	at its center, and there's a grid around it that 
	represents three-dimensional space. We hear a "pulse" 
	sound, and a sphere emanates from the icon, growing 
	larger as it moves away.

					KIRA
			There's nothing within a thousand 
			kilometers...

					SISKO
				(to Carson) 
			Ahead, one quarter impulse.

	Carson works her console.... after a beat:

					SISKO
			Try it again, Major...

	We HEAR the (TECH) pulse, and this time, the expanding 
	circle briefly illuminates a blip near the bottom of 
	the screen.

					KIRA
			There's something about four 
			hundred kilometers below us. It 
			could be the Karemma... I can't 
			tell at this range.

					SISKO
				(to Carson)
			Close to ten kilometers...

17   EXT. SPACE - DEFIANT (OPTICAL)

	as it starts down deeper into the atmosphere.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE     14.

18   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (VPB)

	The ship SHAKES.

					DAX
				(off console) 
			We're crossing into another 
			thermal layer...

	Another SHUDDER...

					CARSON 
			Holding position at ten 
			kilometers.

					SISKO
			Major...

	She works the scanner... we HEAR the pulse, and the 
	icon kicks out a sphere... when it illuminates a 
	blip...

					KIRA 
			From the size of it, I'd say it's 
			the Karemma...

	Just as the sphere is about to reach the edge of the 
	monitor, it illuminates TWO MORE BLIPS near the top of 
	the screen.

					KIRA
				(urgent) 
			I'm picking up two more ships.

	Suddenly the Defiant is ROCKED by phaser fire...

19   EXT. ATMOSPHERE (OPTICAL)

	as the two JEM'HADAR ships drop from above and head 
	toward the Defiant... they open fire...

20   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	as the ship is ROCKED VIOLENTLY by the blasts. 
	Consoles explode... warning KLAXONS sound...

					WORF
			Shields at sixty percent.

					SISKO
			Return fire.

	We hear the SOUND of phasers firing, then take another 
	blast ourselves, which ROCKS the ship hard. The LIGHTS 
	flicker out and are replaced by EMERGENCY LIGHTS.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE     15.

20   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(off console). 
			The Jem'Hadar are breaking off 
			their attack...

					SISKO
			Are they going after the Karemma?

					KIRA

	We hear the SOUND of the hull groaning under pressure.

								INTERCUT WITH:

	Where things are just as bad. Consoles have exploded, 
	a conduit is spewing nitrogen. The SOUND of the hull 
	groaning is no less ominous down here.

	O'Brien turns to Muniz.

					O'BRIEN
			Muniz.

					MUNIZ 
			Yes, sir.

	He grabs a TOOLKIT and heads for the ladder to the 
	second level.

22   EXT. ATMOSPHERE (OPTICAL)

	as the Defiant sinks deeper...

23   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL

	where Quark is holding his hands over his ears to shut 
	out the terrible SOUND of the hull groaning. Hanok is 
	sweating, looking around at the walls as if waiting for 
	them to give way.

24   INT. DEFIANT - JEFFERIES TUBE

	as Dax and Muniz scramble into position and start 
	opening a panel.

					DAX
			All right... let's recalibrate the 
			ODN manifold.

					MUNIZ 
			I'll uncouple the plasma relay...

	The hull GROANS ominously. Dax sees that Muniz's hands 
	are shaking as he works...

					DAX
			Sounds a little like a Yridian 
			Symphony, doesn't it?

					MUNIZ 
			I don't know, I've never heard 
			one.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT ONE     17.

24   CONTINUED:

	The hull GROANS again, and Dax mimics the sound, 
	picking it up and modulating it for a moment into 
	another pitch. After a beat, the hull GROANS again, 
	creating a bizarre sort of counterpoint.

					DAX
			Kind of nice, don't you think?

	Muniz can't help but smile as he works, which is 
	exactly what Dax was trying to do, release some of the 
	tension of the moment.

25   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	Where the tension in the room is palpable. They're 
	sinking, and right now, there's nothing they can do 
	about it.

					CARSON 
			Hull pressure is at nine million 
			GSC and still rising...

					KIRA
				(grim) 
			If we keep losing altitude at this 
			rate, the hull will collapse in 
			less than six minutes.

	Worf turns from a console...

					WORF 
			Sir, the phaser couplings 
			overloaded during the attack. It 
			will take at least two hours to 
			repair them.

					SISKO
			The Jem'Hadar aren't going to let 
			us tractor the Karemma out of here
			without a fight.

					KIRA 
			Right now I'd say we're the ones 
			who need to be tractored out of 
			here.

					SISKO 
			One thing at a time, Major.

	Sisko considers for a moment.

					O'BRIEN 
			O'Brien, here.

					SISKO
			How many atmospheric probes do we 
			have on board?

					O'BRIEN
			Two.

					SISKO
			Could they be rigged with warheads 
			from the quantum torpedoes?

	O'Brien smiles as he realizes what Sisko's up to.

					O'BRIEN
			We'd have to pull out the imaging 
			system to make room inside the 
			casings, but I don't see why not.

					SISKO
			How long?

					O'BRIEN
			Twenty minutes.

					SISKO
			You've got ten.

27   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM

	O'Brien and Stevens are looking through a TOOLKIT for 
	the equipment they'll need to arm the probe. Like 
	Muniz and most of the other Engineering N.D.s, Stevens 
	is an enlisted man. These guys didn't go to Starfleet 
	Academy, they're not as polished as our people, and 
	they have their own work habits and codes of behavior.

	The hull GROANS, and Stevens casts an anxious look 
	around. O'Brien sees that the pressure is getting to 
	him, tries to reassure him...

					O'BRIEN
			You okay... ?

	Stevens tries to keep his chin up.

					STEVENS 
			I'm all right...

	O'Brien knows his men are scared, and that they need 
	encouragement.

					O'BRIEN
			The Captain's gotten us out of 
			tougher spots than this.... last 
			year, when the Romulans tried to 
			invade the Founder's homeworld, we 
			went up against a dozen Jem'Hadar 
			ships

					STEVENS 
			I know, Chief. You've told me the 
			story.

					O'BRIEN
			Yeah?
				(smiling) 
			Well unless you want to hear it 
			again, you'd better get down to 
			the torpedo bay and start working 
			on those probes.

					STEVENS
				(grins) 
			I'm going.

	O'Brien smiles and Stevens moves off. O'Brien turns 
	toward another N.D.

					O'BRIEN
			Janklow, I'm going to need a 
			dualitic inverter. There's one in 
			the Cargo Bay.

	FADE IN:

30   INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL) 

	where BASHIR and an N.D. Nurse are helping a few 
	patients out of Sickbay, some of whom are injured and 
	need assistance. Bashir has a MEDKIT... only EMERGENCY 
	LIGHTS illuminate the corridor, and the door to Sickbay 
	is only partly ajar, as if the power went out and it 
	had to be forced open.

	The entrance to the Jefferies Tube that Dax and Muniz 
	are in can be seen in one wall, and in another, the 
	door to a turbolift.

	At the far end of the corridor, a FORCEFIELD is in 
	place. Behind it we can see and HEAR the compartment 
	rapidly filling with atmosphere.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE  
			Sisko to Bashir.

					BASHIR 
			Go ahead.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE 
			The emergency forcefield won't 
			hold much longer. You've got to 
			evacuate that deck so we can seal 
			it off.

	We follow Bashir's eye to the bulkhead at the other end 
	of the corridor, opposite the forcefield. We can see 
	the frame of the door jam, into which the door will 
	slide.

					BASHIR 
			Aye, sir.
				(to Nurse) 
			Let's get everyone past that 
			bulkhead...

As they set to work assisting the others...

31   INT. DEFIANT - JEFFERIES TUBE

	where Dax and Muniz are working.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE 
			Dax, are you finished?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT TWO     22.

31   CONTINUED:

					DAX 
			Not quite.

								INTERCUT WITH:

32   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	where Sisko is talking to Dax on the com as Kira and 
	Worf look on. Dax and Muniz never stop working.

					SISKO
			Get out of there as soon as you're 
			done.
				(grim) 
			In about thirty seconds I'm going 
			to have to seal that deck.

	Muniz reacts... Sisko is telling them he may have to 
	trap them inside.

					DAX
			Understood.

	Dax sees the look on Muniz's face, tries to reassure 
	him.

					DAX
			We've got to get the engines back 
			on-line. Just keep working and 
			don't think about anything else.

33   INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	Where Bashir is prying the door to the turbolift OPEN 
	to help an N.D. who was trapped inside.

	At the far end of the corridor, the FORCEFIELD is 
	FRITZING ominously from the pressure building up behind 
	it.

	When the last person is past the door frame, Bashir 
	touches a wall panel and the BULKHEAD starts to slide 
	closed.

					BASHIR
				(to com) 
			Bashir to Bridge, I'm sealing the 
			bulkhead.

	Bashir looks down the corridor a last time and sees 
	someone emerging from the Jefferies Tube entrance in 
	the wall. It's Dax.

					BASHIR 
			Dax!

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - 09/11/95 - ACT TWO       23.

33   CONTINUED:

	He slaps the control panel and the bulkhead stops 
	closing, leaving an opening just wide enough for a 
	person to get through.

					BASHIR
			Hurry.

	She helps Muniz get out of the Jefferies Tube, but 
	before they can move away the forcefield collapses. 
	Dax and Muniz are hit by the full force of the 
	pressurized gas, throwing them partway down the 
	corridor toward Bashir. In a split second, the 
	corridor is so filled with gas that it's impossible to 
	see what happened to them.

	Bashir shouts through the opening in the door, into the 
	rush of oncoming nitrogen streaming past him.

					BASHIR
			Jadzia!

	But if she responds, we don't hear it over the roar of 
	the incoming gas.

34   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

					KIRA
			The forcefield is down.

	Sisko has no choice but to say the terrible words.

					SISKO
				(to com)
			Doctor, close that bulkhead.

					BASHIR'S COM VOICE
			They're still in there.

					SISKO
			Now, Doctor. That's an order.

35   INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR

	Bashir is holding himself in the doorway, nitrogen 
	streaming past him. He screams against it, desperate.

					BASHIR
			Dax!

	Suddenly a hand reaches in from the roiling nitrogen: 
	it's Muniz, and Bashir pulls him to safety. The young 
	ensign is wracked with coughs from the poison gas.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT TWO     24.

35   CONTINUED:

	Bashir stares into the blinding jet of gas escaping 
	through the opening in the bulkhead... he knows he has 
	no choice, he has to shut it.

	He reaches up to touch the control panel... but as the 
	door starts to close, he unexpectedly steps through the 
	opening and into the oncoming gas before it shuts 
	behind him. Off the Nurse and N.D.s as they realize 
	what he's done...

36   INT. DEFIANT - TURBOLIFT 

	Through the partly open door we can see the gas roaring 
	down the corridor.  Out of the roiling cloud a figure  
	emerges... it's Bashir, dragging Dax's limp form behind  
	him...

	As soon as they're both inside, he manually JACKS the  
	door shut, muffling the roar outside in the corridor.  
	Coughing and struggling to retain his breath, Bashir  
	reaches to touch a control panel.

	We hear a HISSING sound, and the compartment begins to  
	clear as it's repressurized.

	Bashir looks down at Dax's limp body, opens his Medkit,  
	and gives her a HYPO. After a beat, she coughs to  
	life, struggles to regain her breath.

	Bashir slumps back against the wall, relief washing  
	over him...

					BASHIR  
			Bridge.

	Nothing happens... he tries to work the panel, but gets  
	no response. They're trapped. Off Bashir's face as he  
	reacts to this unexpected development...

37   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	We hear the SOUND of power coming on-line... the LIGHTS  
	come back up.

					KIRA
				(quiet) 
			She did it.

	Sisko acknowledges with a small nod.

					SISKO
				(to Carson) 
			Helm, take us to a higher 
			altitude.

37   CONTINUED:

	Sisko sits silently in his chair, contemplating the 
	lose of Bashir and Dax. After a moment...

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 
			O'Brien to Bridge. One of the 
			atmospheric probes is armed and 
			standing by. We'll have the 
			second one ready in a few minutes.

					SISKO 
			Very good, Chief.

	Sisko turns to Kira.

					SISKO 
			All right, Major. Now that we've 
			got something to defend ourselves

	Where Quark and Hanok are reacting to the change in the 
	SOUND of the hull.

					QUARK
			We're gaining altitude...

					HANOK 
			How can you tell?

					QUARK
				(indicating his ears)
			I've got the lobes...

	Hanok looks relieved... Quark decides the time is right 
	to launch into another effort to try to salvage the 
	deal.

					QUARK
			You've got them, too.
				(off Hanok's look) 
			It's a Ferengi expression. 
			Usually, when we say someone has 
			"the lobes," we mean they have a 
			keen business sense. That's you.

	Quark is laying it on thick, trying to flatter Hanok.

					QUARK
			I'll admit it. You fooled me. 
			I thought you were just another easy 
			mark. But you saw right through 
			my little scam, and taught me a 
			thing or two about doing business 
			in the Gamma Quadrant.

	Quark sits down, shakes his head sadly as if humbled.

					QUARK
			I guess I've gotten lazy. I'm 
			used to dealing with the 
			Federation. You think I was 
			cheating you, you have no idea 
			what I was doing to them. They 
			still haven't caught on.

	Hanok studies him, says nothing, waiting to see where 
	Quark is going with this. After a beat, Quark gives 
	him a sly look.

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/13/95 - ACT TWO 26-28.    

38   CONTINUED:

					QUARK 
			And if someone like me can put one 
			over on them, think of what 
			someone like you could do.

	Hanok looks at him for a moment, then leans forward.

					HANOK
			Someone with my... lobes?

					QUARK 
			Exactly.  And I'm just the man to 
			help you do it. we could become 
			rich, rich beyond our dreams.

	Hanok smiles for a moment, looks like he might go for 
	it.

					HANOK 
			You... are despicable.

	Hanok get up from the table, walks away from Quark, who 
	sits back in his chair defeated...

					QUARK
				(to himself)
			I hate the Gamma Quadrant...

	Off his frustration...

41   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (VPB)

	Kira reacts as the scanner illuminates a BLIP.

					KIRA
			Sir, I have something. It's a 
			Jem'Hadar ship.

	She deactivates the scanning pings so as not to give 
	away their position.

					SISKO 
			Just one?

Kira nods an acknowledgement.

					WORF
			They must've split up to search 
			for the Karemma.

					KIRA
			It's about seventy kilometers 
			above us, on a roughly 
			perpendicular course.

	Sisko addresses Carson at the helmas he works a panel.

					SISKO
			Helm, come about to course zero-
			seven-five mark four. Let's fall 
			in behind them.

					CARSON 
			Aye, sir.

	The deck cants as the ship swings around. The mood is 
	tense... they're flying blind, and there's a Jem'Hadar 
	ship nearby.

	Sisko stands in the center of the room as if gauging 
	the SOUND of the wind outside. He's relying on 
	instinct now... tactical experience, asking himself, 
	"What would I do if I were the Jem'Hadar captain?"

					KIRA
			Do you think they've detected us?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV-09/19/95 - ACT TWO     30.

41   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			I don't know. Let's make it a 
			little harder on them... shut down 
			every non-essential system. It'll 
			minimize our power signature...

	Kira and Worf set to work, moving quickly to a few 
	consoles to shut them off... we hear the SOUND of power 
	systems winding down.

					SISKO 
			All stop.

	Carson works her console.

					SISKO
				(to Worf) 
			Program the probe to home in on 
			the first metallic signature it 
			finds.

	Worf reacts... this is dangerous stuff. As he works his 
	console:

					WORF 
			If it doesn't locate anything 
			within fifty kilometers, the probe 
			might turn back and home in on the 
			Defiant.

					KIRA 
			What if they've changed course, 
			moved out of range?

					SISKO 
			Something tells me they're closer 
			than you think...

	He says this with the simple conviction that comes from 
	instinct.

					WORF 
			The probe is ready, sir.

	Only EMERGENCY LIGHTS illuminate the room, and the dim

					WORF 
			Are you all right, major?

			I think so...

	Kira moves to check on Sisko, who's lying unconscious

	to help her sit up.

					BASHIR  
			How do you feel?

					DAX  
			Terrible...

					BASHIR 
			That's not surprising considering 
			that you took in a few lungfuls 
			of Fluorine.

					DAX
			Next time remind me to hold my 
			breath...
				(looking around)
			I take it we're stuck in here...

					BASHIR 
			I thought about trying to crawl up 
			the turbolift shaft, but it's 
			flooded with gas.

					DAX
			I think I've had enough Fluorine 
			for one day. Maybe we should just 
			stay put and wait for someone to 
			come get us.

			They probably don't even know

					DAX
			Is there anything else I should

					BASHIR 
			We only have a few hours of

	Dax reacts to this grim news. Bashir slumps to a 
	sitting position next to her... after a beat...

					DAX 
			Thanks, anyway.
				(off his look)
			For trying to rescuing me.

					BASHIR
			Lot of good it did you....

					DAX 
			I mean it.

	He hears her simple sincerity, turns to her.

					DAX
			It's funny... if you'd have done 
			something like this a year ago, I 
			would've thought you were trying 
			to be a hero.

					BASHIR 
			And now?

					DAX
			Now that I know you better... 
				(smiles) 
			I realize it was just a stupid 
			thing to do.

	He can't help but laugh.

					BASHIR 
			You're welcome...

	They share a smile... off the warm moment between them.

49   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL 

	where Quark is pacing, and Hanok is ignoring him. 
	Quark has been running it over in his mind and can't 
	figure out why Hanok didn't go for his offer. Finally, 
	he has to say something.

					QUARK 
			You're taking this too personally. 
			Okay, I cheated you. I cheat 
			everyone. It's business. You see 
			what you can get away with, and 
			you've got to figure the other 
			guy's doing the same to you.

					HANOK 
			That's not the way the Karemma 
			conduct business.

					QUARK 
			Oh, come on. You can't tell me 
			you've never padded an inventory, 
			or pawned off a load of 
			substandard merchandise.

	Hanok gives him a cold look.

					HANOK 
			No, I haven't. The Karemma 
			believe that merchandise has a set 
			value, determined by the raw 
			materials and labor involved in 
			creating it.

    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/12/95 - ACT THREE    36.

49   CONTINUED:

					HANOK (Cont'd) 
			Factor in transportation costs and 
			a reasonable profit margin, and 
			you arrive at a fair price.

	Quark is appalled by this dry view of commerce.

					QUARK
			You make it sound so... 
			antiseptic. Where's the 
			bargaining, where's the 
			scheming... where's the greed?

					HANOK 
			Greed leads to misjudgment, which 
			can result in the loss of profit.

					QUARK 
			If there's no risk, there's no 
			thrill. It's just... 
				(with distaste)
			...barter. If you want to win 
			big, you have to be willing to 
			play the odds, it's like.... 
			gambling.

					HANOK 
			Gambling is the last recourse of 
			the desperate. Only a fool would 
			risk losing what he has to chance.

	Quark throws his hands up in frustration, slumps into 
	a chair. There's just no getting through to this 
	guy...

51   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM

	as the hatch to the Jefferies tube OPENS and Worf 
	starts to emerge. O'Brien, Muniz, Stevens and an N.D. 
	have been working to restore ship's systems.

					O'BRIEN
			Commander, am I glad to see you.

					WORF
				(all business) 
			The captain is injured. 
			All bridge functions are off-line.

					O'BRIEN
			We've been trying to route command

					WORF 
			I will take command from here.

	Worf turns to study the consoles O'Brien indicated, 
	sees something not to his liking.

					WORF 
			Who configured these helm 
			controls?

					MUNIZ 
			I did, sir.

					WORF 
			They are not laid out properly.

	Muniz is stressed out enough as it is, and having a 
	Klingon in his face isn't helping. He swallows back 
	his nervousness, tries to explain.

					MUNIZ 
			I realize they're not the same as 
			on the bridge, but I had to make 
			some changes because --

					WORF
				(interrupting) 
			I need to be able to ascertain our 
			status at a glance. Reconfigure 
			these controls to their standard 
			layout.

51   CONTINUED:

	Muniz is a little taken aback by the sharpness of 
	Worf's command. He's not used to dealing with a 
	commander in charge of a "bridge" in crisis, and it's 
	all he can do to get out an acknowledgment.

					MUNIZ 
			Aye, sir.

	Worf moves off and Muniz gets to work.

					WORF 
			Mister Stevens, you will operate 
			the echo-location system we've 
			been using to track the Jem'Hadar.

					STEVENS 
			I'll do my best.

	Worf isn't used to this kind of informality and takes 
	Stevens's comment literally.

					WORF
			I expect nothing less.

	Stevens glances at O'Brien, unsure what he did wrong. 
	O'Brien decides to just move past it.

					O'BRIEN
			Let's get to work...

	They set about their various tasks. Off O'Brien's face 
	as he glances over at his men, then at Worf... He's 
	wondering how well they're going to work together...

	been having trouble thinking up things to say, and has 
	fallen back on talking about work.

					KIRA

			a four shift rotation, it would 
			give people more flexibility with

	She let's out a frustrated breath...

53   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			I'm supposed to be keeping you

				(beat) 
			I'm sorry. I don't know why this 
			is so hard. All I have to do is 
			talk to you. I mean, what do we 
			usually talk about?

	Sisko smiles faintly, tries to speak, and Kira leans in 
	to hear.

					SISKO 
			Work...

	Kira can't help but smile; he's right...

					KIRA
			You're right. That is what we 
			usually talk about. Even when 
			we're not working.

	Her smile fades, and for a beat she looks almost 
	troubled.

					KIRA
			I get the feeling it's not that 
			way with you and Dax, or you and 
			Chief O'Brien.

	She considers for a moment...

					KIRA
			Then again... you're not a revered 
			figure in their religions.

	She looks down at his still features.

					KIRA
			I know you don't like it when I 
			talk about you as the Emissary. 
				(a beat) 
			But that is how I think of you. 
			And maybe that's why it's 
			sometimes hard for me to... relax 
			around you.

	Kira let's out a breath, wonders where to go from here. 
	Sisko sees her frustration and reaches to take her arm 
	in his hand...

					SISKO 
			Nerys... ?

DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT THREE 42-42A.   

53   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA 
			Yes, sir?

					SISKO
			Tell me a story...

	Kira smiles; that sounds easy enough.

					KIRA 
			All right. Do you know the one 
			about the three brothers who went 
			to Jo'kala?

					SISKO
			No...

					KIRA 
			They were kava farmers, and one 
			day they went out into their field 
			and found the biggest kava root 
			they'd ever seen, big as a house. 
			"This will make us rich," said the 
			oldest. And they decided to dig 
			it up and sell it in the city.

	As Kira continues we...

54   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM (VPB) 

	where Stevens is working the echo-scanner which is now

	Stevens reacts to the readout.

					STEVENS 
			Sir, I have something.

	Worf moves to study the readout.

					WORF 
			They're too small to be ships...

					STEVENS

	In the distance, we hear a faint SOUND, gradually

	We hear the SOUND of the second torpedo coming

					STEVENS 
			The second one's still closing...

59   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL (CONTINUOUS)

	After a beat...

					HANOK 
			I suggest we leave this room

					QUARK 
			And go where? If that thing

			destroyed.
				(a beat) 
			Maybe we should try to defuse it.

	Hanok's not sure this is such a good idea.

					HANOK
			We should wait for help.

					QUARK
			What if no one can get to us?

	The play of LIGHTS inside the torpedo changes, we hear 
	a HUM of power.

					QUARK 
			I don't like the sound of that. 
			It's up to us...

	Quark's made his decision.

					QUARK 
			There should be an emergency tool 
			kit around here somewhere.

	Hanok moves to look for it. Quark cautiously moves 
	toward the torpedo... studies its outer shell. Hanok 
	moves to his side, TOOLKIT in hand. Quark indicates a 
	specific part of the nose cone.

					QUARK 
			The arming mechanism must be

	O'Brien indicates a point on the schematic.

					MUNIZ 
			Problem is, we're cut off from 
			that part of the ship.

	Worf considers their options.

					WORF 
			Mister Stevens, recalibrate the 
			Structural Integrity Field to 
			minimize the strain caused by the 
			torpedo.

					STEVENS 
			The field generators are already 
			at their limit compensating for 
			the hull breach on Deck Two.

					WORF
			I am aware of the situation, 
			Mister Stevens. If you cannot 
			carry out my orders, I will find 
			someone who can.

	Stevens reacts, tries to pull himself together.

					STEVENS
			That won't be necessary, sir.

	Stevens sets to work, and Worf crosses to the center of 
	the room; he's in a tough bind and is trying to come up 
	with a way to save the ship.

	O'Brien studies him for a beat from his console, then 
	decides to approach.

					O'BRIEN 
			Could I have a word with you, sir?

					WORF 
			Of course.

60   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			With all due respect, I think 
			you're riding these men a bit too 
			hard. You have to understand, 
			they're out of their element. 
			They're not bridge officers, they 
			didn't go to Starfleet Academy. 
			They're Engineers. They're used 
			to being told to repair something, 
			and figuring out how to do it on 
			their own.

					WORF
			What are you suggesting?

					O'BRIEN 
			Just give them a little slack, 
			ease up on the reins. Let them do 
			what they're good at... and give 
			them a little encouragement now 
			and then.

	Worf takes this in...

			I will take it under consideration.

	O'Brien nods, and moves off to work a console. Off 
	Worf's face as he considers how to proceed...

	Dax nods, presses herself to his chest... after a quiet 
	moment, Bashir laughs softly to himself over some 
	private thought.

					DAX
			What?

					BASHIR 
			Just remembering something.

					DAX 
			Tell me.

	Bashir considers begging off, but decides "Why not?"

					BASHIR 
			When I first came to the station, 
			I used to fantasize that you and 
			I would go off on a runabout 
			together on some mission. 
			Something would go wrong with the 
			ship... and we'd end up drifting 
			around for a few days until they 
			sent someone to rescue us.

					DAX 
			If you don't mind my saying, 
			Julian, that's a very strange 
			fantasy.

					BASHIR 
			I guess it seemed like the only 
			way we'd ever get a chance to 
			spend time alone together. You 
			were always avoiding me.

	Dax pulls herself away a bit so she can see his face. 
	This is something they've never discussed head on, and 
	it isn't easy.

					DAX
			It's just... you came on so 
			strong. You didn't give me a 
			chance to get to know you.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT FOUR    49.

	Bashir has enough perspective on it now to admit she's 
	right.

					BASHIR
			You're right, I didn't...

	A quiet moment passes... Dax shudders against the cold, 
	and Bashir holds up his arm so she can huddle close 
	again...

					BASHIR
				(lightly) 
			Don't worry, Jadzia. It's been a 
			while since I had that particular 
			fantasy.

	Dax smiles, moves close again. After a beat...

					DAX
			How long a while... exactly?

					BASHIR 
			I don't know. Couple of years, 
			maybe.

					DAX
			Oh...

	He hears something in her tone and a realization hits 
	him...

					BASHIR 
			You're disappointed.

					DAX
				(objecting) 
			Julian.

					BASHIR 
			That's it. You enjoyed being 
			chased, and now you miss it.

					DAX
			That is preposterous.
				(a warning) 
			And if you start chasing after me 
			again --

					BASHIR 
			Now that I know you liked it, I 
			don't need to, do I?

	Dax doesn't know what to say to this. Bashir smiles, 
	leans back in his moment of victory... and Dax finds 
	herself in the unusual position of not having anything 
	to rebut him with... off this moment...

	O'Brien is on the upper level repairing an open

	Worf approaches them from behind.

					WORF 
			I require your assistance.

	They're both startled by his sudden appearance behind 
	him, and are expecting the worse.

					WORF 
			I need a weapon...

					MUNIZ 
			We still have one atmospheric 
			probe.

					WORF 
			If my plan is to work, the probe 
			will not be available to use as a

					STEVENS 
			Phasers are out of the question,

					MUNIZ 
			But the phaser generator is

	They consider for a beat...

			The Deflector Array.

	Muniz realizes what he's proposing, excitedly 
	continues.

					MUNIZ 
			With a few modifications, we could 
			use it as a phaser emitter.

62   CONTINUED: 

	Suddenly they realize that they've been talking to each 
	other about this and that Worf might not approve; they 
	contain their enthusiasm, respectfully defer to him.

					STEVENS 
			It may not be what you had in 
			mind, sir...

					MUNIZ 
			And there is one problem... It'll 
			overload after the first shot.

	Stevens and Muniz look at Worf anxiously awaiting his 
	verdict... after a beat, Worf allows himself what 
	might almost be a smile.

					WORF
			I only need one shot.

	Stevens and Muniz share a look of relief; they're 
	pleased because they finally did something Worf 
	approves of.

					WORF 
			How long will it take to make the

					MUNIZ
				(to Stevens) 
			Twenty minutes?

					STEVENS 
			Ten if we can bypass the safeties.

					WORF 
			Go.

	The two men move off to climb the ladder to the second 
	level, exchanging ideas about how to do it faster.

	Worf turns to study a console, and we REVEAL O'Brien

	Sisko. She's scanning him with her tricorder as she 
	speaks.

					KIRA
			... but then the brothers started

			money they got for the kava root. 
			The oldest said that since it was

			he should get more. The youngest 
			objected, saying he was the one 
			who'd tended the field where...

	Kira's voice trails off as she reacts to the readings 
	on the tricorder. The situation is grim... she's losing 
	him.  For the first time, her emotions start to get the 
	best of her.

					KIRA 
			This can't happen... you can't

	do...

					KIRA 
			I don't know if this is the right

	She steels herself, then injects Sisko in the neck... 
	not knowing if this will save him or kill him. After 
	a beat...

					KIRA 
			Captain... I know that my beliefs 
			can make you feel uncomfortable 
			around me. And that maybe they're 
			the reason you keep me at arm's

	We hear in her voice that this is something she
	regrets, but now she pushes it aside, and a certain 
	resolve enters her voice...

	alien technology is complex and far from clear.

					QUARK
			Okay... now what... ?

	Quark pulls out the tricorder, scans the torpedo. 
	Hanok studies the innards for a moment... then 
	indicates a particular set of diodes.

					HANOK
			One of these diodes connects the 
			warhead to the power source... the 
			other is the firing mechanism.

	Quark gives him a look.

					QUARK
			How do you know that?

					HANOK 
			I saw a design schematic once.

					QUARK 
			Where?

					HANOK 
			At the Ministry of Trade on 
			Karemma.
				(off Quark's look) 
			We sell these torpedoes to the 
			Jem'Hadar.

	Quark is momentarily stunned...

					QUARK
			You're kidding.

					HANOK 
			No...

66   CONTINUED: 

	The irony of the situation and the tension of the 
	moment threatens to give Quark a case of the giggles...

					QUARK 
			I thought you said you'd never 
			sold substandard merchandise...
				(off Hanok's look) 
			It was supposed to explode on 
			impact, wasn't it?

	Hanok can't help but smile...

					HANOK 
			Maybe I should offer them a 
			refund...

	And they both break into laughter... wracking, painful 
	laughs like those that can strike in church or at a 
	funeral.

	Suddenly the SOUND of the torpedo's HUM increases in 
	pitch. They both freeze, the laughter instantly cut 
	off.
					QUARK
				(a whisper) 
			We'd better do something about 
			this torpedo of yours...

	They look at each other, and they just can't help it... 
	they break out laughing again...

					HANOK
				(through laughter) 
			We have to remove the firing 
			diode... but I don't know which 
			one it is...

					QUARK
				(through laughter) 
			And if we pick the wrong one... we 
			die...

	They calm down... get a grip on themselves...

					QUARK 
			This isn't funny... we just have 
			to pick the right one... it's 
			fifty-fifty... better odds than 
			you get at the dabo table...

					HANOK 
			dabo?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/12/95 - ACT FIVE   54A.

66   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK 
			It's a game... if we get out of 
			this, I'll teach it to you.
				(beat; re: diodes) 
			Choose one.

					HANOK 
			How?

					QUARK 
			It's a gamble. Go with your
			instinct.

	Hanok hesitates, struggles to decide.

					QUARK
			You're thinking too much. You 
			just have to reach in and grab 
			one.

	Without thinking about it, Quark reaches in and plucks 
	one of the diodes out. The LIGHTS in the torpedo cut 
	out and the hum stops. There's a beat before they 
	realize what's just happened. Then a slow smile 
	spreads on Quark's features.

					QUARK
			Looks like we have a winner.

	They both move away, sit down with immense relief..,.

					HANOK
				(a realization) 
			That was... exciting.

					QUARK 
			Feels good, doesn't it?

					HANOK 
			Yes...

					QUARK 
			That's how it works. The bigger 
			the risk, the bigger the win.
				(beat) 
			You know... there's another risk 
			you could take... staying in 
			business with me.

					HANOK 
			You never give up, do you?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/12/95 - ACT FIVE    55.

66   CONTINUED:	(3)

					QUARK 
			No. I tried to cheat you, and I 
			lost. That doesn't mean I'm going 
			to give up the game... 
				(a beat) 
			Come on, Hanok. What do you 
			say... do you want to keep 
			playing?

	Hanok studies him for a moment... picks up one of the 
	PADDS...

					HANOK
     			Let's talk about these Bolian
     			currency fluctuations...

	Quark smiles, realizes he's back in business... as they 
	pick up their PADDS...

67   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE 

	where Kira's head is bowed as she murmurs her prayer...

					KIRA
			Jia'kaja, tre'nu'tol'a rem...
			La'por i'lanu kos... I'nar
			tan'a'tali nor...

	Sisko stirs...

					SISKO
				(groggy)
			Major... ?

	Kira reacts, a look of relief washes over her features. 
	She makes a small gesture of thanks to the Prophets.

					KIRA 
			Yes, captain?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/18/95 - ACT FIVE    56.

67   CONTINUED:

	She leans in close so she can hear his words...

					SISKO
				(softly)
			What... happened... ?

					KIRA 
			The Jem'Hadar hit us pretty bad... 
			Worf went down to the Engine Room 
			to --

					SISKO
				(stopping her)
			No, no...

	Kira stops herself, uncertain...

					SISKO
			What happened to the three 
			brothers?

	Kira breaks into a grin...

					KIRA 
			They gave the money away, and went 
			back to their farm where they 
			belonged.

					SISKO
				(smiles)
			Is good...
				(a beat)
			Can you tell me another story... ?

					KIRA 
			I'd love to, sir...

	Off this moment of closeness...

68   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM (OPTICAL)

	All are listening to the rhythmic pulses of the echo-
	scanner. The tension in the room seems to rise with 
	each ping. After a moment...

					O'BRIEN
				(urgent) 
			Sir, I've got something.

	Worf moves to the monitor. On the OKUDAGRAM, the hand 
	illuminates a blip moving toward the center of the 
	scanner.

					O'BRIEN 
			It's the Jem'Hadar... they've 
			locked onto the tetrion pulse...

	Worf turns to Stevens, who's ready at his console.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/14/95 - ACT FIVE    57.

68   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			Stand by, Mister Stevens...

	The steady "pinging" continues...

69   EXT. ATMOSPHERE (OPTICAL)

	as the Jem'Hadar ship moves toward camera... the sound 
	of the "pinging" continues... the ship comes to a 
	stop... and CAMERA PULLS back to REVEAL the source of 
	the "pinging" SOUND...

	Not the Defiant, but the atmospheric probe. . .hanging 
	motionless in the atmosphere, a BLINKIE flashing in 
	synch with the pinging. Defiant has set up a decoy...

70   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM

	A tense beat, then...

					WORF
			Now.

	Muniz and Stevens both reach to work their consoles...

71   EXT. ATMOSPHERE (OPTICAL)

	The Jem'Hadar ship starts to bank away from the probe, 
	but suddenly the Defiant ENTERS frame behind it and 
	opens FIRE... a bolt of ENERGY shoots out from the 
	deflector array and destroys the Jem'Hadar in a fiery 
	EXPLOSION...

72   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM

	A moment of triumph between all the participants. 
	Muniz and Stevens clasp hands...

					O'BRIEN
			What do you say we find the
			Karemma and get out of here?

	Off Worf's nod of acknowledgment...

73   INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR

	where two N.D.s are prying the door to the turbolift 
	OPEN.

74   INT. DEFIANT - TURBOLIFT

	as the door OPENS, casting light onto Bashir and Dax, 
	who blink from the change in brightness...

 					WORF (V.O.) 
				(continuing) 
			Damage control teams are repairing 
			the ship's systems and medics are 
			tending to injured crewmembers.

	As the N.D.s move to assist them we cut to:

75   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	where a MEDIC is tending to Sisko as Kira and Carson 
	look on. He's going to be all right.

					WORF (V.O.)
			We have located the Karemma ship 
			deep in the atmosphere and are 
			moving to assist. It appears that 
			it will have to be abandoned...

76   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL

	where Quark and Hanok are bent over their PADDS.

					WORF (V.O.) 
				(continuing)
			... and its crew brought back to 
			Deep Space Nine until 
			transportation can be arranged to 
			the Karemma Homeworld.

	Muniz ENTERS with a toolkit and reacts to the 
	incongruous sight of two men haggling while a torpedo 
	sticks in the wall nearby...

	Establishing.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/11/95 - ACT FIVE    59.

77A  INT. QUARK'S (FORMERLY SC. 79) 

	Worf and O'Brien are seated at a table having 
	beverages, Bashir is trapped at the bar with MORN, who 
	seems to be chewing his ears off, and Dax is playing 
	darts with an N.D.

	ODO is standing near the dabo table suspiciously 
	watching Quark hovering over Hanok. Hanok is anxiously 
	watching as the wheel winds down; he's got a lot of 
	money riding on this spin. The wheel comes to a stop, 
	and from the crowd's reaction we see that Hanok's lost. 
	Quark tries his best to act sympathetic, even though 
	Hanok's loss is his gain.

					QUARK
			Oh!  Pass five, too bad.

	The dabo girl gives Hanok a sympathetic expression.

					QUARK
			You lose half your stake. You can 
			either quit now, or try to double 
			it.

					ODO 
			My advice is to take what latinum 
			you have left and walk away.

	Hanok looks at Quark, considers for a moment, and 
	finally says...

					HANOK 
			Just because you lose a bet, that 
			doesn't mean you give up the game.

					QUARK 
			Exactly.

	Quark shoots Odo a satisfied look. He and Hanok have 
	come a long way, but even so, there's no reason to risk 
	getting himself cleaned out, so Quark decides to give 
	him some bad advice.

					QUARK 
			May I suggest placing your next 
			wager on double down.

	Hanok studies the board, considers.

					HANOK
				(to the dabo girl) 
			Put it all on triple over.

	Quark reacts, and his face tells us this is exactly the 
	right play.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/11/95 - ACT FIVE    60.

77A  CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			I think you're making a big
			mistake.

					HANOK
				(reaffirming)
			Triple over.
				(to Quark)
			Nothing personal, Quark.

					QUARK
				(smiles wanly)
			Of course not...

	Quark watches with dread as the wheel spins. It comes 
	to a stop... and this time the crowd's reaction tells 
	us Hanok's won. Quark tries to muster a gracious 
	smile...

					QUARK
			You're really catching on...

	Off Quark's face as he realizes he's in for a long 
	night...

77B  ON BASHIR AND MORN (FORMERLY SC. 80)

	where Bashir is trying to be polite.

					BASHIR
			... seventeen brothers and
			sisters... ? That's quite a
			family.

	Morn nods, and is about to start in again when Dax 
	comes up to them with a DART in her hands.

					DAX
			Excuse me, Morn.

	She turns to Bashir.

					DAX
			It's your turn.

					BASHIR
			For what?

					DAX
				(holding it up)
			Darts.

	She fixes him with a look and he realizes she's giving 
	him an excuse to get away.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/11/95 - ACT FIVE    61.

77B  CONTINUED:

					BASHIR 
			Oh, right. Sorry, Morn. Nice 
			talking to you.

	They move away toward the dart board...

					BASHIR 
			Thanks for rescuing me.

					DAX
				(lightly) 
			Now we're even.

	As they share a smile and continue away, we DROP OFF on 
	Stevens, who's ENTERED and is making his way over to...

77C  O'BRIEN AND WORF (FORMERLY SC. 78)

					STEVENS
				(to Worf) 
			Excuse me, sir.

	Stevens indicates a PADD he's carrying.

					STEVENS 
			Here's the repair schedule we drew 
			up for the Defiant.

	He hands it to Worf.

					STEVENS 
			With your approval, we thought 
			we'd start by tearing out the 
			secondary ODN lines. They're 
			shot, and it'll be easier to get 
			to the manifolds that way. After 
			that we figured we'd --

					WORF
				(interrupting) 
			Proceed at your discretion, Mister 
			Stevens.

	Stevens is taken aback for a moment, then breaks into 
	a grin...

					STEVENS
			Thank you, sir...

					WORF 
			How long will the repairs take?

					STEVENS 
			Sixteen hours.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/15/95 - ACT FIVE    62.

77C  CONTINUED:

	Worf nods, Stevens starts away..

					O'BRIEN 
			You can do it in twelve.

					STEVENS 
				(recovering) 
			Sure, twelve. No problem.

				WORF 
			Very well.

	Stevens moves off... Worf throws O'Brien a 
	questioning look.

					O'BRIEN 
			You have to give them a lot of 
			slack, but you can't take your 
			hands off the reins...

	As Worf ponders this...

81   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE 

	where Sisko is sitting behind his desk as Kira finishes 
	up a report.

					KIRA 
			-- the Karemma transport will be 
			here by eighteen hundred tomorrow, 
			and the Defiant should be ready to 
			escort them back to the Gamma 
			Quadrant.

					SISKO 
			Good.

	Sisko brings up something he's been thinking about.

					SISKO 
			Major, it occurred to me that we 
			should consider going to a four 
			shift rotation. I think the crew 
			might appreciate having more 
			flexibility in their schedules.

	Kira reacts, wondering if Sisko remembers her 
	mentioning this to him.

					KIRA 
			I'll look in to it first thing in 
			the morning.

	Sisko nods, then pops another question.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Starship Down" - REV. 09/13/95 - ACT FIVE    63.

81   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			What are you doing for the next
			few hours?

					KIRA
			I'm going off duty, I thought I'd
			just relax.

					SISKO
			You want to go to a ball game?

	Kira reacts to this unexpected invitation...

					KIRA
			I'd love to, sir.

	Sisko smiles, and moves to rummage through a cabinet or 
	drawer.

					SISKO
			Meet me in Holosuite Three in half
			an hour.

					KIRA 
				(smiles)
			See you then.

	She turns away...

					SISKO
			Nerys...

	She turns back as he tosses her a baseball cap.

					SISKO
			You'll need this...

	She catches the cap, sees the letter G on it, and puts 
	it on. Sisko smiles at the sight.

					SISKO
			You get the hot dogs from Quark...

					KIRA
			Hot dogs?

					SISKO
			He'll know...

	She smiles, and takes her leave. Sisko watches her go, 
	and after a beat, puts on his own cap... off this 
	moment we...
