	FADE IN:

INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL

	The place is full. BASHIR, EZRI, KIRA and ODO are
	at one of the tables. Throughout the conversation,
	Bashir seems distracted.

					ODO
				(to Ezri)
			By the way, your gagh has
			arrived.

					EZRI
			My what?
				(groans)
			Oh, no.

					ODO
			Oh, yes. And it's waiting for
			you in Cargo Bay Two.

					KIRA
			Your gagh?

					EZRI
			Jadzia ordered it. She was
			planning a party for Martok's
			birthday next week.

					KIRA
			How much gagh did she order?

					ODO
			Fifty-one cases.

					EZRI
			Each containing a different
			variety.

					KIRA
			There are varieties of gagh?

	Ezri looks ill.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal" - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER         2.

1    CONTINUED:

					EZRI
			Oh, yes. I can remember what
			each one tastes like... and the
			way they... move when you swallow
			them. Torgud gagh wiggles.
			Filden gagh squirms. Meshta gagh
			jumps...

	Ezri almost gags and Bashir tunes in for the first
	time.

					BASHIR
				(to Ezri)
			You all right?

	She nods and quickly downs some of her drink.

					KIRA
				(to Bashir)
			Are you all right?

					BASHIR
			Me?

					KIRA
			You've barely said three words.
			Something on your mind?

					BASHIR
			Oh.
				(trying to be light)
			Just... can't wait to see Miles.

					KIRA
			Let me guess -- you have a
			holosuite appointment -- defending
			the Alamo again?

	Bashir's smile is just a little forced.

					BASHIR
			You know me too well.

					KIRA
			When's his transport get in?

					BASHIR
			Half an hour.

					EZRI
			Bithool gagh has feet.
				(to Odo)

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       3.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)
					EZRI (Cont'd)
			Flush it out the airlock. All of
			it.

					ODO
				(shakes his head)
			Environmental regulations.

					KIRA
			Why don't you give it to Martok?

					EZRI
			He'd insist on sharing it with me
			as a point of honor.
				(beat)
			Wistan gagh is packed in targ
			blood.

	She gets up from the table.

					EZRI
				(continuing)
			I have to go now. I'll see you
			later.

					BASHIR
			I think I'll head out as well.

					ODO
			Give my regards to Santa Anna.

	Bashir gives him a quick smile, then he and Ezri
	EXIT.

									CUT TO:

2    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	A TRANSPORT is docking at the station.

3    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	Bashir is watching and waiting as a long stream of
	N.D. Passengers ENTER from the airlock with their
	CARRY-ON LUGGAGE and head off down the Corridor.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       4.

3    CONTINUED:

	Bashir's anxiety grows as he searches the faces of
	all the passengers and never sees O'Brien. The last
	passenger debarks and then the airlock door ROLLS
	SHUT and Bashir looks very worried. He thinks for a
	moment, reaches a difficult decision, and quickly
	EXITS.

									CUT TO:

4    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	SISKO SLAMS a PADD down on the table in fury.
	Bashir is facing him with a chastened expression.

					SISKO
			What!

					BASHIR
			Miles asked me not to say
			anything. But I haven't heard
			from him in three days... and he
			wasn't on this morning's
			transport. I think something may
			have happened to him.

					SISKO
			He told me he was going home to
			visit his father.

					BASHIR
			Well... he may have implied he
			was going to visit his father,
			but he didn't actually say that--

					SISKO
			Doctor, please.

					BASHIR
			Yes, sir.

					SISKO
			So where is he?


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       5.

4    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			The last message I got said that
			he was still in New Sydney, and
			that he was following up on some
			promising leads.

					SISKO
			He's not a detective! He's an
			engineer -- he's my chief
			engineer and now he's missing!

	Sisko takes a beat to let his temper cool.

					SISKO
			So tell me about this woman he's
			supposed to be looking for.

					BASHIR
			She's the widow of Liam Bilby.
			You remember Bilby?

					SISKO
				(thinks)
			The man O'Brien befriended during
			that undercover operation last
			year?

					BASHIR
			Yes, sir. Miles still feels
			responsible for his death. He's
			kept in touch with Bilby's widow
			ever since... and when she
			dropped out of sight three weeks
			ago he got worried and decided
			to go find her.

					SISKO
			And now they're both missing.
			Perfect.

					BASHIR
			In his defense sir, he did try to
			go through official channels
			first. But... the authorities on
			New Sydney weren't very helpful
			and since it's a non-Federation
			world, Starfleet doesn't have
			jurisdiction...

					SISKO
			So he decided to turn into a one-
			man police force.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       6.

4    CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			Yes, sir.

	Sisko takes a moment to think over his options.

					SISKO
			New Sydney. That's in the
			Sappora System, right?

					BASHIR
			Right.

					SISKO
			I want a written report,
			detailing everything you know
			about this woman, O'Brien's plan
			to find her, and anything else
			you've neglected to mention.

	Sisko heads for the door.

					BASHIR
			Aye, sir. May I ask what you're
			going to do?

					SISKO
			No you may not. I want that
			report on my desk within the
			hour.

	Sisko EXITS, leaving a very chastened Bashir.

									CUT TO:

5    INT. EZRI'S QUARTERS

	Sisko has been talking to Ezri about O'Brien.

					SISKO
			... and since your family still
			lives in the Sappora System, I
			thought they might have a few
			contacts on New Sydney.

					EZRI
			I'm sure they do. My mother's
			one of the more important
			business leaders in the system.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       7.

5    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Your personnel file says she owns
			the fifth largest pergium mining
			facility in the entire sector...

					EZRI
			Actually, it's the sixth now.
			The Ferengi discovered a large
			deposit on Timor Two a few years
			ago. My mother nearly had a
			heart attack when she found out
			we'd been knocked out of the top
			five.

					SISKO
			Do you think she'd be willing to
			intervene with the local
			authorities -- get them to look
			into what happened to the chief?

					EZRI
			I'm sure she would.

					SISKO
			That's the first good news I've
			heard all day.

	Sisko is somewhat relieved, but Ezri suddenly looks
	troubled.

					SISKO
			Something wrong?

					EZRI
			No. Yes. I don't know.
				(beat)
			I haven't talked to my mother in
			almost six months.

					SISKO
			Oh.

					EZRI
			The last time I saw her was just
			after I was joined. She came to
			visit me on Trill. I was still a
			little... confused. When she
			walked into my room, I put on a
			big smile, looked her straight in
			the eye and said, "Hi, Mom, it's
			me -- Curzon!" Things kinda went
			downhill from there.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       8.

5    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			I'm sure she understood what you
			were going through. You weren't
			prepared to be joined -- she
			couldn't blame you for being
			confused.

					EZRI
			She didn't. Not really. But she
			did want me to come home to
			recuperate.
				(beat)
			We had a disagreement.

					SISKO
			Not for the first time... ?

					EZRI
				(sighs)
			No, not for the first time.

	Beat.

					SISKO
			If there was any other way, I
			wouldn't ask you to do this.

					EZRI
			It's all right. My family
			problems aren't as important as
			finding the chief. I'll call my
			mother right away.

					SISKO
			Thanks, old man.

					EZRI
			Anytime.

	Sisko EXITS. OFF Ezri's face as she gets ready to
	make the call she's been dreading...

									CUT TO:

6    INT. EZRI'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	on it is the face of YANAS TIGAN, a lean and regal-
	looking Trill woman in her late fifties. She wears
	a tastefully tailored CASUAL SUIT. She's beautiful,
	and radiates the iron resolve of a self-made woman.
	Yanas looks upon her only daughter with unreserved
	affection. But instead of basking in her mother's
	attention, Ezri seems uneasy.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER       9.

6    CONTINUED:

					YANAS
			We've been worried about you.

					EZRI
			I'm all right. Really. And I'm
			a lot more sure of who I am than
			the last time you saw me.

					YANAS
			Well, that's a relief.
				(wry smile)
			I'd hate to have to start calling
			you Curzon.

	Ezri smiles a little, but she's clearly
	uncomfortable.

					EZRI
			I... I've been promoted.

					YANAS
			Oh?

					EZRI
			Lieutenant junior grade Ezri Dax
			at your service.

	The name causes Yanas to stiffen slightly.

					YANAS
			Ezri... Dax.

					EZRI
				(awkward)
			The symbiont name always replaces
			the family name of the... new
			host. It's traditional.

	Yanas only lets the disappointment show for a
	second, then she puts on a pleasant expression
	again.

					YANAS
			Of course it is. I haven't been
			away from Trill that long.
				(cheerfully)
			The important thing is you're
			doing well.

	Ezri decides to come to the point of her call.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - TEASER      10.

6    CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI
			Mother, I've called because I
			need your help. One of our
			officers -- Miles O'Brien -- went
			to New Sydney three weeks ago and
			now he's missing. Captain Sisko
			was wondering if maybe you could--

					YANAS
			I'll do everything I can.

					EZRI
			Thank you.

					YANAS
			Now. When are you coming home?

					EZRI
			I don't know when I can get
			away...

					YANAS
			Ezri, you haven't been home in
			three years.

					EZRI
			I know... but with the war on and
			everything...

					YANAS
			Ezri Tigan... Dax. Tell your
			commanding officer that your
			mother is a very difficult woman
			and that she refuses to help look
			for Mister O'Brien unless you're
			allowed to come home right away.

					EZRI
			Mother, no. Don't put me in this --

					YANAS
			Good-bye, Ezri. I'll see you
			when you get here.

	Yanas ENDS the TRANSMISSION. Ezri stares at the
	screen as she lets out a long and painful sigh.

	She's not at all happy about being railroaded into a
	family reunion.

7    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	Bashir escorts Ezri to the airlock. She carries a
	shoulder bag, he's holding a HYPOSPRAY and a PADD.
	N.D. SUPERNUMERARIES as required.

	Bashir hands her the hypospray.

					BASHIR
			Use twenty milligrams at the
			first sign of spacesickness. If
			you wait any longer, you'll
			regret it.

					EZRI
			So will the other passengers.

	He hands her the PADD.

					BASHIR
			Everything Starfleet knows about
			Bilby and his widow.

					EZRI
			What about your report?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT ONE      13.

7    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			It's in there -- it's the one
			with Captain Sisko's bootprints
			all over it.

					EZRI
			Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be
			out of the doghouse by the time I
			get back.

					BASHIR
			Let's hope so.

	They come to a halt before the airlock. A RUNABOUT
	waits on the other side. She hesitates and lets out
	a long breath before taking the plunge.

					BASHIR
			Would it help if I said that as
			someone who isn't especially
			close to his parents -- I do
			sympathize.

					EZRI
			I'm about to present my family
			with a whole new Ezri. And to
			tell you the truth, they didn't
			know what to make of the old one.
				(beat)
			But, thanks for trying, Julian.
			I'll let you know as soon as I
			find out anything about Miles.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			Have a safe trip.

	She turns and enters the airlock. As the door
	closes behind her, Bashir's attempt at a smile wilts
	into a worried expression.

									CUT TO:

8    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	A RUNABOUT moves into orbit around Sappora VII -- a
	barren rock of a planet.

9    EXT. TIGAN COMPOUND - DAY (MATTE)

	The planet's surface is rocky, rough and
	inhospitable. The Tigan mining compound is sited
	upon the crest of a bluff overlooking the
	surrounding landscape and a brackish lake. The
	compound buildings are enclosed within an energy
	dome. The design of the compound reflects the fact
	that everything necessary for humanoid habitation
	must be brought in from off-planet.

10   INT. TIGAN LIVING ROOM

	It's spacious and comfortable, with a large stone
	fireplace at one end of the room. Other exits lead
	to hallways and to the home OFFICE. The main doors
	OPEN to reveal Ezri, in uniform and carrying her
	overnight BAG. She walks into the empty room with a
	look of remembrance and discovery -- this is both a
	homecoming and a first-time visit for Ezri.

	She drops her bag at the foot of one of the stone
	columns supporting the ceiling and looks around.
	Her gaze falls on an impressionistic painting
	hanging on one wall. She's taking a closer look at
	it when her brother NORVO ENTERS from the hallway.
	Norvo is the dreamer of the family, a gifted
	poet/intellectual, but also a weaker and more
	fragile person than either of his siblings. He
	beams at the sight of his sister.

					NORVO
			Zee!

					EZRI
				(happy)
			Norvo...

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT ONE      15.

10   CONTINUED:

	He rushes into the room and hugs her tightly.

					NORVO
			I can't believe you're really here.

					EZRI
			Neither can I.

	He lets her go and stands back for a moment.

					NORVO
			You cut your hair.

					EZRI
			It kept getting in my eyes...
				(re: hairdo)
			You like it?

					NORVO
			It'll take a little getting used
			to.

					EZRI
			I think you've just summed up my
			whole visit.
				(re: painting)
			Is this yours?

	Norvo barely glances at it.

					NORVO
			Mom insisted on hanging it in
			here. I hate it.

					EZRI
			Why?

					NORVO
			The composition is puerile and
			obvious. The colors belong on a
			child's toy and the technique is
			laughable.

					EZRI
			But other than that...

					NORVO
			It's perfect.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

	There's the sound of a DOOR OPENING from O.S. and
	they turn to see Ezri's older brother, JANEL, ENTER.

	He's bigger and more imposing than Norvo -- a man
	who's spent most of his life in the difficult and
	unforgiving mining business. Janel is more closed
	than Norvo, and there's a hint of restrained anger
	just below the surface. He's wearing filthy overalls,
	a mining helmet, and there's a fair amount of dirt and
	grime covering his hands and face as well.

	He also regards Ezri with affection, but it's tinged
	with the condescending attitude of an older brother
	who's always seen his siblings as less capable than
	he.

					JANEL
			Welcome home, little girl.

					EZRI
			Hi, Janel.

	For her part, Ezri has always looked up to Janel,
	but there's no denying that she's much closer to
	Norvo.

					JANEL
			Do I have to take a sonic shower
			before I get a hug?

	She gives him a look, then hugs him.

					EZRI
			It's good to see you.

					JANEL
			You too.

	He ruffles her hair.

					JANEL
				(re: hair)
			What happened here?

					NORVO
			She cut it. I think it brings
			out her eyes... gives her more of
			a classic look.

					JANEL
				(whatever)
			It's cute.

					JANEL (Cont'd)
				(beat)
			Mom's on her way. She said to
			give you the preliminary police
			report on your friend.

	Janel leads them toward another room.

					EZRI
			Have they found anything?

					JANEL
			Not yet...

	They EXIT to...

11   INT. TIGAN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	It's a large room, built to permit the family to
	work at home during the off-hours. It has plenty of
	room for a VIEWSCREEN, computer TERMINALS, and Yanas
	Tigan's DESK. (And no one sits at the desk, but
	Yanas.) BOXES of isolinear REFERENCE CHIPS and
	displays of OLD MINING EQUIPMENT and SAMPLE CRYSTALS
	line the SHELVES.

	Janel goes to a PADD sitting on the desk and hands
	it to Ezri.

					JANEL
			... but they have a few leads.

	Ezri looks over the PADD.

					JANEL
			I hope you appreciate how much
			trouble she's going to. She
			called in a lot of favors from
			the New Sydney police.

					EZRI
			Of course I appreciate it.

	Janel doesn't believe her, but won't argue the
	point.

					NORVO
			How long are you staying?

					EZRI
			I'm... not sure yet.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT ONE      19.

11   CONTINUED:

					JANEL
				(to Norvo)
			She's not going to be here a
			minute longer than she has to,
			you know that.

	Norvo visibly deflates.

					EZRI
			We're in the middle of a war,
			Janel. I have responsibilities
			back on DS Nine.

					JANEL
				(shrugs)
			There's always something.

	Ezri stiffens and shoots her brother a look, but
	before she can fire back a response, the door OPENS
	and Yanas ENTERS.

	Yanas is the kind of woman who commands a room from
	the moment she enters it and this is no exception.
	She's wearing casual work clothes that've been
	stained by her recent trip to the mines, but she
	still manages to look elegant nonetheless. Yanas
	stands there on the threshold for a moment, drinking
	in the sight of Ezri with undisguised emotion. She
	loves her only daughter as only a mother can and her
	eyes grow moist at this moment of reunion.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT ONE      20.

11   CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI
			Hello, Mother.

	Yanas manages a smile through the tears of joy.

					YANAS
				(choked up)
			I hate your hair...

	She laughs and Ezri smiles. Yanas holds out her
	arms and Ezri quickly goes to her and they embrace.
	Yanas lets go of her and looks Ezri over for a beat.

					YANAS
			Have you eaten?

					EZRI
			Not yet.

					YANAS
			Good. Because I've got Korella
			working on a very special dinner.
				(to Janel)
			Have you taken care of Lorkin?

					JANEL
			I was just about to contact him.

					YANAS
			I want him paid and gone by the
			time dinner's ready.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT ONE      21.

11   CONTINUED:	(3)

					JANEL
			Yes, ma'am.

					YANAS
				(to Norvo)
			And what about that third quarter
			review I asked for?

					NORVO
			I'm still working on it.

	Yanas restrains her temper when it comes to her
	younger son. She treats him with strained patience
	in contrast to the no-nonsense attitude she displays
	toward Janel.

					YANAS
	You've been working on it for a
	week now.

	Norvo shrinks away from Yanas, is almost visibly
	afraid of her despite her forbearance.

					NORVO
			I... miscalculated some of the
			revenues. I had to redo them.

					YANAS
			I know you don't like doing the
			bookkeeping, but I really need
			that review as soon as possible,
			all right?
				(he nods)
			Good.

	Yanas takes Ezri's arm and arm and heads out of the
	office.

					YANAS
			I want to show you the new
			solarium. I had all the tile
			brought in from Andoria and then
			hand-painted by this charming old
			man I met on a trip to the
			Hovarian Cluster...

	Ezri and Yanas EXIT. Once they're gone, Janel
	touches a control panel.

					JANEL
				(to com)
			Have Mister Lorkin report to the
			main house.

11   CONTINUED:	(4)

					COM VOICE
			Yes, sir.

					NORVO
				(to Janel)
			Why're you getting rid of Lorkin?

					JANEL
			That broken waveguide in fourteen
			three-A is going to cost us a
			thousand bars of latinum a day.
			Mother thinks it's the result of
			sloppy maintenance.

					NORVO
			What do you think?

					JANEL
				(ominous)
			I think a brand new waveguide
			doesn't just "break."

	For some reason, Norvo is very worried by this. He
	wrings his hands for a moment, then sits down and
	takes a few deep breaths.

					NORVO
				(worried)
			You mean... Bokar was behind
			it... ?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT ONE      22.

11   CONTINUED:	(5)

					JANEL
			He's trying to send us a message.
			The Orion Syndicate doesn't take
			no for an answer.

					NORVO
			Maybe we should tell Mother...

					JANEL
			No. I can deal with Bokar.

	Norvo is getting more scared by the minute.

					NORVO
			I don't know...

	Janel goes to him and takes him firmly by the
	shoulders.

					JANEL
	Relax. Everything is going to be
	all right.

	Janel slaps him gently and smiles confidently. OFF
	Norvo's still-worried look...

12   EXT. TIGAN COMPOUND - NIGHT (MATTE)

	Night has fallen on Sappora VII.

13   INT. TIGAN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Dinner is almost over. The grilled hamsha (some
	sort of odd-looking steak) is all but gone, and
	Ezri's plate has several bones on it from her
	multiple helpings. Yanas is at the head of the
	table, Ezri to her right, and the boys to her left.
	An N.D. Servant minds the dishes, refills drinks,
	etc. Yanas, Janel and Ezri have all changed
	clothes for dinner.

					EZRI
			... Jadzia considered Kira one of
			her best friends, and I'm
			starting to think of her the same
			way. We spend a lot of time
			together.

					JANEL
			She didn't have any trouble
			adjusting to having a... "new
			Dax" in her life?

					EZRI
			No more than anyone else. I
			don't think any of them were
			expecting another Dax to walk
			into their lives.

					NORVO
			Hmm. Did any of them wonder if
			you --

	Yanas breaks in without so much as a glance at
	Norvo, who accepts the interruption with barely a
	reaction.

13   CONTINUED:

					YANAS
			Whatever happened to that young
			man on the Destiny you were so
			interested in? Lieutenant...
			something?

					EZRI
			Brinner Finok. He was an Ensign.
			I did talk to him after I was 
			joined... once. I don't think
			we're right for each other
			anymore. He reminds me too much
			of my son, Gran. It makes me a
			little uncomfortable to be around
			him now.

	The others exchange a look. Ezri starts to get a
	little flustered.

					EZRI
			Sorry. He reminds me of Audrid's
			son, Gran.
				(nervous laugh)
			I'm still sorting out my
			pronouns.

					NORVO
			I'm sure all joined Trills go
			through this.

	Ezri tries to laugh it off, but ends up rambling on
	and letting more of her insecurities show than she
	was anticipating.

					EZRI
				(trying to be light)
			No, just me.

					EZRI (Cont'd)
			Nothing simple for Ezri.
			There're times when the computer
			asks me to identify myself and I
			have to think about what to say.
			Worse yet, there're days when I
			wake up and I don't even know if
			I'm a man or a woman until I pull
			back the covers.

	She laughs, but no one else is laughing with her --
	they're all staring at her with concern. She
	finally stops herself and clears her throat.

					EZRI
			I also have an unfortunate
			tendency to ramble...

	Yanas puts her hand on her daughter's and conveys
	both reassurance and pity at the same time.

					YANAS
			Don't be embarrassed. It's not
			your fault. You should've gone
			through years of training before
			receiving a symbiont. It wasn't
			fair of them to join you to Dax
			just because you happened to be
			the only Trill on board. It's no
			surprise to me that you're having
			trouble sorting out eight
			lifetimes' worth of memories and
			experiences.

					EZRI
			It can be a little...
			overwhelming at times.

					YANAS
			I'm sure. But don't worry.
			We'll take care of you... won't
			we?

			Absolutely.

	She looks at Janel, who quickly chimes in.

					JANEL
			Of course.

					EZRI
			That's... good to know. But I
			think I've got things under
			control.

	But Ezri's protest is lost on Yanas, who strokes her
	daughter's face with pity.

			Ezri... you always were too proud
			for your own good.

14A  INT. NORVO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Norvo's room looks like someone overturned the
	contents of a museum in here. The walls are crammed
	with artwork -- some his, some not. The shelves are
	filled with books, sculptures, busts and high-tech
	devices. The bed is unmade and littered with
	isolinear rods, PADDS and a few half-eaten meals.
	The floor is covered with art supplies, tools,
	opened books, etc. One corner is taken up with an
	easel and another painting. Norvo is sitting at the
	desk (also overflowing with materials) and working
	with a PADD. The door CHIMES.

	Norvo looks around in surprise. There's another
	CHIME. He suddenly smiles in realization.

					NORVO
			Come in, Zee.

	Ezri ENTERS

			How'd you know it was me?

			No one else would bother with the

	Ezri looks around the messy room.

					EZRI
			I see some things never change.

	Norvo smiles.

					NORVO
			Here...

	He sweeps up an armful of junk from the bed and
	relocates it to another part of the room, carefully
	putting each and every item down.

					NORVO
			... have a seat.

	Ezri sits on the bed and looks at the artwork on the
	wall.

					EZRI
			How many of these are yours?

					NORVO
			All the bad ones.

					EZRI
			When did you become such a harsh
			critic of your own work?

						NORVO
			Just being realistic. It's
			amateurish. I know that. it
			says so right there --

	He points to a PADD which is hanging on the wall.
	Ezri takes it down for a better look as Norvo
	reaches for a bottle on a shelf.

						NORVO
			Saurian brandy?

					EZRI
			Sure.

	He wipes out a glass, then stops himself and looks
	embarrassed.

			Norvo, this doesn't mean--

					NORVO
				(lifts glass)
			To my sister -- a shining angel
			in a dark sky.

	Ezri clinks his glass and they each take a sip.

					EZRI
				(re: PADD)
			All right. The Andorian Academy
			rejected your application... that
			doesn't mean your work is
			"amateurish." There are other
			art schools.

					NORVO
			It's the best.

					EZRI
			You shouldn't just give up.

	Norvo swirls the brandy around the glass with a
	deprecating smile.

					NORVO
			I'm not very good, Zee. I never
			was.
				(re: paintings)
			All this... it's an indulgence.
			Just like my other "hobbies" --

					NORVO
			I can't concentrate. My mind

			discipline it takes to succeed.

					EZRI
			Those are Mother's words -- I
			know, because I've heard them
			too. She wasn't right about me
			and she's not right about you
			either.

					NORVO
			I'm fine with the way things have
			turned out. Really.
				(quiet)
			Besides, they need me here.

					EZRI
			To do what? The family
			bookkeeping? Norvo, you could do
			so much more.

	Norvo stares down into his glass for a long beat and
	Ezri decides she's pushed far enough for tonight.

					EZRI
			I'm not trying to make you feel
			bad. I just want you to know

17   CONTINUED:

					YANAS
			Well, maybe you should. You'll

			morning he was passed out in the
			entry room. Evidently he spent
			most of the night doing this...

	Yanas reaches behind the desk and pulls out the
	painting seen earlier hanging in the living room.
	Someone has painted a large cartoonish smiley face
	right in the center of the artwork. Ezri smiles a
	little at the sight.

					YANAS
			You think it's funny?

					EZRI
			I think it's funny that you think
			he did this because of me. He's
			not happy here, can't you see
			that?

					YANAS
			That's nonsense.

					EZRI
			Mother, he's defacing his own
			artwork -- work that you insisted
			on displaying after he objected.

					YANAS
			I'm proud of him... I'm trying to
			encourage him.

					EZRI
			But all you've done is make him
			feel trapped and powerless.

					YANAS
			You've barely spent one night in
			this house and you think you can
			analyze our entire family. You
			don't know your brother anymore,
			Ezri. Norvo is a fragile young
			man who needs to be cared for.

					JANEL
			Sorry to interrupt, but...

21A  INT. NORVO'S BEDROOM

	Norvo is passed out on his bed as Ezri ENTERS. He
	rouses himself as Ezri sits down on the edge of his
	bed. The artwork on his walls has been taken down
	and is lying in a heap in a corner of the room --
	some of the paintings have been slashed and others
	have obviously broken frames. The now-empty bottle
	of saurian brandy is overturned on his desk.

					NORVO
			Good morning.

					EZRI
			Good afternoon.

					NORVO
			Oh.

	He sits up and tries to clear the cobwebs from his
	brain.

21A  CONTINUED:

					NORVO (Cont'd)
			Mother... is not going to be
			happy about this...

					EZRI
			Don't worry. You're out of the
			line of fire for the moment --
			she's busy torturing Janel and
			Miles.

					NORVO
			Miles... ? Oh, your friend. They
			found him?

					EZRI
				(nods)
			He's fine.

					NORVO
			Great. That's really great, Zee.
				(beat)
			Does that mean you're leaving?

					EZRI
			Not right away.
				(beat)
			Let's talk about you... more
			specifically, about what you did
			last night.

	She looks over at the artwork lying on the floor and
	Norvo winces at the sight of it.

					NORVO
			Oh, yeah... last night.
				(beat)
			What can I say? When I get
			drunk, I become an art critic.

21A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI
			Do you regret what you did?

	Norvo checks the bottle to see if there's a last
	drop -- there's not.

					NORVO
			Not really. I never liked those
			pieces anyway.

					EZRI
			So what are you feeling?

					NORVO
				(with a smile)
			I am feeling like I don't want to
			be analyzed by my sister.

					EZRI
			Sorry. It's what I do.

					NORVO
			This situation isn't that
			complex, Zee. I'm wallowing in
			self-pity and acting out my
			frustrations by throwing
			tantrums.

					EZRI
			All right Doctor Norvo, if that's
			your diagnosis, what's your
			prescription?

					NORVO
			Mother disapproves of suicide --
			all that blood on the carpets.

					EZRI
			Not funny.

					NORVO
			Best I can do with a hangover.

	Norvo rubs his eyes and Ezri considers him for a
	beat.

			Norvo... what would happen if you

					NORVO
			What do you mean?

					EZRI
			I mean, what would happen if you
			went back to Deep Space Nine with
			me?

					NORVO
			Mother would go insane.

					EZRI
			Forget about her for the moment.

					NORVO
			I can't just... pick up and leave.

					EZRI
			It doesn't have to be a permanent
			move. Think of it as a
			vacation... a break from all
			this. Some time to clear your
			head, that's all.

	Norvo is sorely tempted by what she's saying, but
	something is holding him back.

					NORVO
			I don't know if I can leave all
			this on Janel's shoulders...

					EZRI
			Janel can handle it.

					NORVO
			It's not that simple... there're
			some things going on that are...
			complicated.

					EZRI
			Like what?

					NORVO
				(evasive)
			Things... with the company...

			No offense, Norvo, but you're not

			together. Mother can pay a real
			accountant to do the work she's
			given you.

					NORVO
			I don't know, Zee...

	Ezri decides not to push.

					EZRI
			Think about it?

	He nods, he will. She smiles and EXITS. He looks
	after her for a beat, sorely tempted by the offer,
	but deeply disturbed by something at the same
	time...

22   INT. TIGAN MINES

	A series of interconnecting tunnels filled with 
	twenty-fourth century MINING EQUIPMENT. The walls have 
	had lighting fixtures built into them for years and we
	should get the feeling that this is a busy, active
	mining operation. N.D. Workers are wearing well-
	used coveralls and helmets, and are constantly
	moving through the caverns, fixing equipment,
	checking soil samples on portable high-tech
	equipment carts, going over plans, sifting through
	rocks, etc.

	O'Brien is working on a TRANS-SONIC DRILL while
	Janel looks on. The drill is a large piece of
	equipment about the size of a mini-van. There's a
	beam emitter at one end, which is used for cutting
	into the ore. O'Brien has a panel opened on the
	chassis and is poking around with some kind of tool.
	Janel has a tricorder open.

					O'BRIEN
			You're right. The problem's in
			the secondary input transtator.

					JANEL
			But the transtator checks out
			perfectly...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT THREE    44A.

22   CONTINUED:

	He holds out the tricorder for O'Brien to see, but
	the chief doesn't even look at it.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm sure it does. But it's the
			wrong transtator for this drill.

					JANEL
			What?

	O'Brien pulls the CIRCUIT CARD from the drill and
	shows it to him.

					O'BRIEN
			You need a fifty-two J, this is a
			fifty-two L.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT THREE     45.

22   CONTINUED:	(2)

					JANEL
			It says fifty-two J...

					O'BRIEN
			I know. But it's definitely an
			L. It must've been accidently
			mislabeled.

					JANEL
				(darkly)
			Or deliberately...

	A voice interrupts.

					BOKAR'S VOICE
			Another equipment failure?

	They turn to see that BOKAR has just stepped into
	the cavern. Bokar is a well-dressed Farian (also in
	a helmet) who has a somewhat chilling quality to him
	despite his outwardly pleasant demeanor.

					BOKAR
				(to Janel)
			Perhaps if you hadn't dismissed
			Mister Lorkin, this wouldn't have
			happened.

					JANEL
				(tight)
			He was dismissed on my Mother's
			personal order.

					BOKAR
			Then we'll have to find a way of
			changing her mind, won't we?

	Janel glares at him, but says nothing. Bokar's gaze
	goes to O'Brien, who's taken an instant dislike to
	Bokar.

					BOKAR
				(continuing)
			Who's your new mechanic, Janel?

					JANEL
			This is Mister O'Brien. He's a
			friend of the family.

					BOKAR
			That wouldn't be Chief O'Brien
			would it?

					O'BRIEN
			How'd you know that?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT THREE     46.

22   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BOKAR
			I have several friends in the New
			Sydney Police. I heard they
			recently rescued a Starfleet
			chief named O'Brien from an
			unpleasant situation.

					O'BRIEN
			That's me. I don't believe I
			caught your name.

					BOKAR
			Thadial Bokar. I'm a commodities
			broker, attempting to establish
			business ties with the
			illustrious Tigan family.

	Bokar and O'Brien eye each other for a moment as
	they size up one another. Finally Janel breaks the
	moment.

					JANEL
				(to O'Brien)
			Could you excuse us for a moment,
			Chief. Mister Bokar and I have
			some business to discuss -- thank
			you for your help. I'll have a
			new transtator installed right
			away.

					O'BRIEN
			Glad to do it.

	With another look at Bokar, O'Brien EXITS. They
	both wait until O'Brien is out of earshot before
	turning on each other.

					JANEL
			Sabotaging our drills isn't going
			to convince me to do more
			business with the Orion
			Syndicate.

					BOKAR
			We'll argue about that later. We
			have more immediate concerns.
			O'Brien is with Starfleet
			Intelligence.

					JANEL
			No, he's not. He works with my
			sister on Deep Space Nine.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT THREE     47.

22   CONTINUED:	(4)

					BOKAR
			That may be what he wants you to
			think. But why was he on New
			Sydney trying to infiltrate the
			Syndicate?

					JANEL
			He was looking for some woman.

					BOKAR
			"Some woman." Do you know the
			name of this woman?

					JANEL
			No.

					BOKAR
			Well I do. Her name was Morica
			Bilby.

	That name clearly means something to Janel, and he's
	shocked to hear it in this context.

					JANEL
			What... ?

					BOKAR
			Now, of course, I haven't heard
			from Morica Bilby in quite some
			time... rumor has it that she's
			dead, but I wouldn't know
			anything about that.

	Janel is getting more uncomfortable by the moment,
	but Bokar's eyes just keep boring into his...

					BOKAR
			What I do know is that Chief
			O'Brien should leave this system.
			Quickly. Before something
			happens to him.

	Bokar EXITS. OFF Janel's troubled expression...

	Mid-conversation. Janel is facing O'Brien.

					JANEL
			So you're not leaving until

					O'BRIEN
			Probably. It really depends on
			Ezri.

					JANEL
			Why?

					O'BRIEN
			She's my superior officer. I go
			when she goes.
				(light)
			Besides, I'm not looking forward
			to seeing Captain Sisko. He's
			got a boot with my name on it.

	But Janel isn't in a joking mood.

					JANEL
				(curt)
			This isn't a good time for
			guests. There's a lot of work to
			do. The quicker you're on your
			way, the better.

	With that, Janel turns and EXITS. O'Brien is a
	little surprised by Janel's anger. There's a beat,
	then Ezri ENTERS.

					O'BRIEN
			Your brother seems eager to get
			rid of us.

					EZRI
			Don't mind him. He's under a lot
			of pressure.

					O'BRIEN
			Hmm.

			Do you know a man named Thadial

					EZRI
			No. I make it a point to know as

			family business.
				(beat)
			Why?

					O'BRIEN
			He came down to the mine to talk
			with Janel while I was working on
			the drill... there was something
			about him... it reminded me of
			when I was working undercover
			with the Orion Syndicate... the

					EZRI
			You think this Mister Bokar is a
			member of the Syndicate?

					O'BRIEN
			It's just a feeling. But it's a
			pretty strong feeling.

					EZRI
			We should tell Janel.

					O'BRIEN
			I think Janel knows. I realize
			I'm not giving you a lot of hard
			evidence here, lieutenant -- but
			Janel seems like a man who's
			being pressured by the Syndicate.

					EZRI

					EZRI
			No. He... has other interests

				(laughs at herself)
			I don't know why I'm sugar-

					O'BRIEN
			I'm sorry to hear that.

			It's all right. I can't believe

			excuses for either of them.
				(beat)
			You know, if there's one thing

			Remember when the Ferengis opened

			About a month after Bokar

	Yanas and Janel ignore him again, but Ezri sees

	the argument, the way his hands are shaking
	slightly, the tension bubbling up inside him... and
	she begins to suspect an awful truth. Ezri goes to
	the couch and sits down next to him while Yanas and
	Janel continue to fight.

     I may not have shed any                   (quiet, to Norvo)
     tears when I found out               Norvo... you don't know
     she was dead, but I                  what happened to Morica,
     didn't kill her.                     do you?

               YANAS                                NORVO
     Then who did?                             (broken smile)
                                          I'm the idiot brother
                                          how would I know?

               JANEL                                EZRI
     The police said it was an                 (rising fear)
     accident!                            Tell me you don't know
                                          anything about this

	Yanas has suddenly tuned in to what's happening on
	the other side of the room, and Janel follows her
	gaze...

					NORVO
				(distant)
			I tried to reason with her. But
			she was... very angry. Angry at
			the Syndicate. Angry at us.
			Even angry at her husband for
			getting himself killed.

28   CONTINUED:	(6)

	Norvo is oblivious to their attention... he's talking
	only to Ezri -- his one lifeline in this family.

					NORVO
			I didn't go there to kill her,
			Zee. I really didn't. But she
			wouldn't listen to me. She
			started yelling... said our
			family was no different than the
			Syndicate. That we were all
			liars and cheats.
				(beat)
			Then... I suddenly realized that
			if she were dead... all our
			problems would go away.

	There's a moment of dead silence. No one can
	believe it. Yanas can barely speak.

					YANAS
			Norvo...

	He looks up at her for the first time, tears
	starting to well up in his eyes.

					NORVO
			I took care of it. You always
			said I was too weak to... handle
			the tough ones.
				(beat)
			But I'm not. I proved it.
				(to Janel)
			I handled a problem that you
			couldn't.
				(beat)
			I handled it.

	There's a long silent moment as the family grapples
	with what's happened and what will happen now...

29   INT. TIGAN LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Several hours later. Fuchida and N.D. Police
	officers are leading Norvo away in handcuffs. Ezri
	and Janel watch in shock as their brother is taken
	away. There's a quiet beat as the door closes
	behind them. Janel is in shock. He tries to deal
	with the mundane and familiar as a way of shutting
	out what just happened.

					JANEL
			I need to... inspect the... ore
			samples from fifty-three C. We
			have to make a decision on...
			whether to open up a new--

					EZRI
			Janel. Forget about the mine.
			It doesn't matter.
				(beat)
			I want you to listen to me.
			After Norvo's... trial is over,
			you need to go.

					JANEL
			Go where?

					EZRI
			It doesn't matter. Just go.
			Find another life for yourself.
			Trust me -- you'll be happier.

	Janel looks at her for a beat, then Ezri gives him a
	kiss and EXITS to...

30   INT. TIGAN OFFICE - DAY

	Yanas is sitting at her desk, staring off into space
	when Ezri ENTERS. Yanas suddenly looks much older
	than she ever did before.

					EZRI
			They've taken Norvo.
				(no answer)
			I talked to Dad a little while
			ago. He said he's coming home.
				(beat)
			I'm going to stay on New Sydney
			for the trial... then head back
			to D.S. Nine.

	Yanas says nothing and Ezri finally decides to
	leave.

					YANAS
			This isn't my fault, is it Ezri?
			I didn't do this, did I?

	Ezri just looks at her mother for a beat, then EXITS
	without a word. Yanas has her answer.

	Re-establishing the station.

32   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL

	QUARK and WORF are arguing at one of the tables.
	Worf hands him a Ferengi PADD.

					WORF
			This is not my bar bill.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Prodigal... " - REV. 11/05/98 - ACT FIVE     63.

32   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			You're a member of the House of
			Martok, right? You don't want it
			to get out that you're refusing
			to honor the debts incurred by
			your own House, do you?

	Worf grabs the bill back in irritation and puts his
	thumbprint on it.

					QUARK
			Always a pleasure to do business
			with the House of Martok.

33   ANGLE ON

	Ezri, who's sitting alone at another table. O'Brien
	ENTERS from the Promenade and approaches her.

					O'BRIEN
			Mind if I join you?

	She shakes her head.

					O'BRIEN
			When'd you get back?

					EZRI
			Last night.
				(beat)
			Norvo was sentenced to thirty
			years.

					O'BRIEN
			I wish I could say I'm sorry.
			But considering what he did... he
			got off easy.

					EZRI
			I understand why you feel that
			way.
				(beat)
			But you didn't know him. He was
			very... gifted. When we were
			young... he had so much
			potential. Norvo was the one we
			all thought would turn out to be
			something... special. I don't
			know what happened. I don't know
			what turned my brother into...
				(can't say it)

33   CONTINUED:

					EZRI (Cont'd)
			I guess I was so busy dreaming of
			ways to get out of that house...
			I never saw what was really going
			on inside it... what was
			happening to Norvo... the endless
			humiliations... the constant
			drumbeat of criticism... the way
			his heart was carved up into
			little pieces. I should've seen
			it. I should've tried to stop
			it.

	Beat.

					O'BRIEN
			You can't blame yourself for
			that. You're not responsible.

					EZRI
			But I am. Don't you see?
				(beat)
			I should've gone home a long time
			ago.

	She gets up from the table and walks away...
