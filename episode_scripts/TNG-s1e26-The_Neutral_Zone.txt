2    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The great ship is motionless as it awaits the return of
	its captain. A short distance off, and APPEARING very
	small, is another vehicle - also drifting.

					RIKER (V.O.)
			First officer's log, stardate 41986.0.
			The captain has left the ship for
			a conference and we are awaiting
			his return. It is unusual for us
			to be motionless, and a unique
			experience for everyone concerned.

3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	GEORDI is at Conn - WORF at Tactical - DATA at Science
	One, RIKER is in the Command position. Troi is off the
	bridge in her office. Everyone is looking at the
	viewscreen.

					DATA
			This is quite intriguing. It is
			transmitting a carrier signal on
			a frequency which has not been used
			for centuries.

					RIKER
			Is there a message?

					DATA
			None. Just the carrier, possibly
			intended for encoded computer or
			telemetry information.

					WORF
			I have never seen a space vehicle
			like it.

      STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - TEASER      2.

3    CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Strictly speaking, it is not a
			"space vehicle." It appears to
			be a satellite, similar in its
			rudimentary design to those which
			orbited Earth in the late
			twentieth and early twenty-first
			centuries.

					RIKER
			Three hundred years ago.
				(mostly as a joke)
			Then there probably aren't any
			life signs?

					DATA
			None.

	Data continues studying the readout.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The power is solar... quite
			primitive. There is however
			minimum life support.

					GEORDI
			I wonder how it got out here.
			If it was in orbit around Earth,
			even at maximum impulse -- and
			there's no way it could travel
			any faster, it would have taken
			a dozen centuries to get here.

					WORF
			At its present speed and heading,
			the vehicle will eventually enter
			the Kazis Binary system and will
			certainly be destroyed.

	Worf turns to face Riker.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			Sir, I could attach a tractor beam
			and adjust its heading.

					RIKER
			I think not, Mister Worf. It's just
			a piece of space debris. If we
			weren't sitting here waiting for
			the captain, we wouldn't have even
			noticed it. Leave it be. Let
			nature take its course. How long
			until Captain Picard returns?

    STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - REV. 3/18/88 - TEASER    3.

3    CONTINUED: (2)

					WORF
			The last communication indicated
			it would be several hours.

					DATA
			Commander, request permission to
			investigate this vehicle.

					RIKER
			Why, Data? It's just a derelict.

					DATA
			It is a piece of history. The
			opportunity to examine such an
			ancient vehicle does not come
			around very often, and as you
			pointed out, we do have the time.

					RIKER
			All right, Data. But be ready
			to beam back before the captain
			returns.

					DATA
			Thank you, sir.

					RIKER
			Lieutenant Worf -- go with him.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

	Nothing happens.

			Computer...

	Data interrupts.

					DATA
			In the late twentieth century,
			computers were not voice activated,
			Worf.

	Data examines the keyboard.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Notice the readouts -- dials,
			needle machines, gauges.
			Remarkable what they used three
			centuries ago. The on-board
			computers have ceased functioning.
			I may be able to download this old
			style disk drive back to the
			Enterprise.

8    WORF

	APPROACHES the door, clearly expecting it to slide open.
	He waves a hand in front of it.

					WORF
			It must be sealed -- probably
			with age. I will blast it open.

					DATA
			Not necessary.

	He reaches down and turns a handle, physically slides
	the door OPEN.

	They move forward.

    STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - REV. 3/18/88 - TEASER    5.

10   INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)

	Riker is sitting at the Command Chair.

					RIKER
			Data, this is Riker. What
			have you found?

					DATA
			Very little so far.

					GEORDI
			I have picked up the captain's
			shuttle.

					RIKER
			E.T.A.?

					GEORDI
			Twelve minutes, sir.

					RIKER
			Alert Main Shuttle Bay.

					GEORDI
			Aye, sir.

11   INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM

	As Worf and Data ENTER the other compartment they see a
	series of crypts, lining both sides of the room. Each
	glass-covered and coffin-like in design, with a
	computerized panel above it. The panel both monitors
	and controls the crypt.

12   CRYPT

	As Data clears away the frost TO REVEAL a shriveled
	human form. It's all BLACKENED AND HIDEOUS. Data
	REACTS.

					DATA
			The seal was broken and the
			environment has been corrupted.

	Data moves to the next crypt. Beside him, Worf wipes
	the frost from a third crypt. He has found another
	shriveled form.

					WORF
			Here's another.

      STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - TEASER      6.

12   CONTINUED:

	Data wipes away the frost from the crypt by him.

					DATA
			This one is empty.

	He easily lifts the cover.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			It has been forced open and the
			occupant removed.

	In the b.g. Worf is wiping the frost from another
	crypt.

					WORF
			Commander. Look at this.

	Data steps over.

12A  ANOTHER ANGLE

	Through the hole which Worf has wiped in the frost,
	WE CAN SEE a human -- a WOMAN. About thirty-five,
	attractive and unconscious.

	OFF Worf and Data's REACTIONS, WE:

									FADE OUT.

12B  INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM

	Worf and Data are still beside the frozen woman.

					WORF
			Has she been frozen for an
			extended journey?

					DATA
			If that were the purpose, there
			would be evidence of a more
			sophisticated monitoring system.
			This container is designed solely
			for refrigeration.

					WORF
			What is the destination?

					DATA
			I do not believe they were going
			anywhere. This vehicle should
			still be in Earth orbit.

					WORF
			There is no way it could break
			orbit and travel this distance
			on its own power. Not in three
			hundred years -- not in three
			thousand. Some intelligent lifeform
			must have brought it to
			this section of the galaxy.

					DATA
				(indicating the crypts
				 with the shriveled
				 forms)
			These crypts were opened.
				(indicating the empty
				 crypts)
			The occupants in those were taken.

					WORF
			Why take some of them, destroy
			others, and leave her apparently
			untouched?

					DATA
			Perhaps they learned all they
			could from the others. We may
			never know.

14   INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE

	Data and Worf have for the moment been forgotten.

					GEORDI
			The captain's shuttle is
			approaching Main Shuttle Bay.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Enterprise, this is the captain.
			Number One, I want to get underway
			as soon as the shuttle is secure.

					RIKER
			Aye, sir. We will make all
			preparations.
				(to the Away Team)
			Commander Data, return to the
			Enterprise -- immediately.

					DATA'S COM VOICE
			We have run into an unusual
			situation here. There are people
			on-board. Frozen.

					RIKER
			Frozen. How many?

15   INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)

	Data and Worf in the middle of the room.

					DATA
			Three. What should I do? The
			vehicle has suffered severe
			damage. Most of the systems
			have failed.

					RIKER
			Are you recommending they be
			transferred to the Enterprise?

      STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE      9.

15   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			I do not think we should leave

					GEORDI
			Aye -- laying in the course now.

			Captain, those coordinates will

	REACTIONS from the others to the destination.

					PICARD
			That's correct Mister La Forge, warp

			Warp eight.

					PICARD
			Engage. Mister La Forge, you have

19   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

	The regulars are at their positions, except Beverly.

					PICARD
			Two Federation outposts in Sector
			three-zero have been destroyed.
			There has been no communication
			with any Federation starbases in
			Sector three-one since stardate
			41903.2.

					WORF
			Romulans.

					PICARD
			That is the assumption.

					RIKER
			There's been no direct contact
			with the Romulans since the Tomed
			Incident.

					PICARD
			The question is: Why here? Why
			now? What's their objective, if
			indeed they have one? For half
			a century there's barely a whisper
			about them and now for no apparent
			reason they seem to be back with
			a roar. Why?

					RIKER
			Almost everything we know about
			them is based on rumor and
			conjecture.

					PICARD
			The strategic decision is to send
			one ship.

					RIKER
			The Enterprise.

					PICARD
			Yes.

					WORF
			There is a risk. We could get
			out there and find ourselves
			greatly over-matched.

					PICARD
			True enough -- it is a gamble.

   STAR TREK: "... Neutral... " - REV. 3/18/88 - ACT ONE   11.

19   CONTINUED:
					RIKER
			This first encounter... coming
			so suddenly after all this time.
			There's a very good chance it's
			a setup.

					DATA
			Perhaps the Romulans are probing.
			They want to see how we react.

					WORF
			Captain, we should expect
			hostilities.

					PICARD
			Prepare as always. If force is
			needed we will use it, but that
			will mean we have failed. Our
			goal here is to establish some
			kind of relations with the
			Romulans -- failing that -- to
			convince them of our resolve and
			to do this without resorting to
			force. Right now, the general
			feeling is that they are seeking
			a confrontation. They may want
			to test themselves in battle
			against a Federation starship to
			gauge how much we have advanced.
			Personally, I think it is
			possible they have different
			motives altogether based on needs
			which we have not identified.
			If that's the case... I must know
			it.
				(to Troi)
			Counselor -- I will need a complete
			profile on them.

					TROI
			There is limited information, but
			I will prepare something.

					PICARD
			Data. Extrapolate for me the
			logical progression of their
			technical advancement;
			specifically, but not restricted
			to -- weapons.

					DATA
			Aye, sir.

     STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE     12.

19   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(to everybody)
			I want this thought through
			completely. Anticipate, as much
			as you can, all the possible
			permutations.

	He looks around the room.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Computer, how long before we
			arrive at the Neutral Zone?

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Nineteen hours, twenty-eight
			minutes.

					PICARD
			We will reassemble in six hours.
			Let's be smart. No surprises.
			I would much rather outthink them,
			than outfight them. Questions?

	There are none. The meeting breaks up.

20   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	As Picard, Riker and the others COME ON to the bridge.
	Geordi is in the Command seat.

					GEORDI
				(as he gets up)
			Captain.
				(then:)
			Doctor Crusher said she would like
			to talk with you, when you
			finished your meeting.

					PICARD
			Thank you.
				(on Com)
			Doctor Crusher, this is the
			captain.

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
			Oh, good. Captain, could you
			possibly join me in Sickbay?

	Picard hesitates.

   STAR TREK: "... Neutral... " - REV. 3/23/88 - ACT ONE   13.

20   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
				(continuing)
			I would not ask you if it wasn't
			important.

					PICARD
			I will be right there.
				(to Riker)
			Take the Conn, Number One. I
			won't be long.

	Picard EXITS THE SHOT as Riker takes his position.

21   INT. SICKBAY

	Picard ENTERS.

					PICARD
			What is it, Doctor?

					BEVERLY
			It's the people from the capsule.

					PICARD
			Capsule? People? What people?

					BEVERLY
			The people Data beamed over.

					PICARD
			I wasn't aware he had.

	On the medical tables behind her are THREE HUMANS
	covered with sheets.

					BEVERLY
			Well, he did and they were frozen.
			I thawed them.

					PICARD
			You what?

					BEVERLY
			I didn't know what else to do.
			The crypts in which they had been
			frozen were literally falling
			apart. It was either that...
			or...

					PICARD
			What's their condition?

   STAR TREK: "... Neutral... " - REV. 3/22/88 - ACT ONE   14.

21   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Right now they are all sleeping.
			Each of them needed minor medical
			attention... minor "now", but
			"then" their conditions were
			obviously terminal. One had a
			heart problem, another had an
			advanced case of emphysema and
			extensive liver damage. But the
			most surprising thing, is that
			each of them had been frozen after
			they died.

					PICARD
			After they died?

					BEVERLY
			Exactly. Cryonics. It was a
			kind of fad in the late twentieth
			century. People feared dying.
			It terrified them. At the moment
			of death, they would be frozen,
			so that later... some time in the
			future, when presumably medical
			science had a cure for whatever
			killed them, they would be thawed
			back to life, healed and sent on
			about their business.

					PICARD
			Well, for this group, apparently
			it worked.

	Picard STEPS OVER to the com panel.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Lieutenant Commander Data, please
			report to Sickbay -- immediately.

22   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Data is a Science Station Two. He looks up.

					DATA
			Permission to leave the bridge.

					RIKER
			Granted.

	Data walks toward the turbolift.

     STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE     15.

23   INT. SICKBAY

	ON Picard.

					PICARD
			I am never critical of any member
			of my staff being curious, but...
			the timing is just so...

					DATA
			I could not leave them there,
			Captain. The condition of the
			vehicle was deteriorating.

					PICARD
			But, Data -- they were already
			dead. I mean... what more could
			have happened to them?

					DATA
			I see your point, Captain, but
			at the time...

	Picard nods.

					PICARD
			You're right -- under the
			circumstances I would have done
			exactly the same.

	Picard turns to Beverly.

					BEVERLY
			When they arrived... what was I
			supposed to do? Not help them?

	Again Picard has no answer.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			My question is: What do we do
			with them now?

					PICARD
			What are the options?

					DATA
			We cannot go back and return them
			to their ship.

					BEVERLY
			We can't refreeze them.

   STAR TREK: "... Neutral... " - REV. 3/21/88 - ACT ONE   16.

23   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			They are alive now, so we have
			to treat them as living human
			beings.

					BEVERLY
			Alive and well, just waiting to
			be awakened.

	Picard is perplexed.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			I have them sedated but they
			should be up and about as soon
			as possible.

	Picard takes a deep breath.

					PICARD
			Well...

	He looks around for a moment.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Then, there really is no choice.

					BEVERLY
			None that I can see.

					PICARD
			Before you wake them, I want
			Security here.
				(touching com)
			Mister Worf, report to Sickbay.

24   BEVERLY

	She goes to the first one in the line and touches the
	hypospray to her neck.

     STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE     17.

25   WOMAN

	Slowly she wakes up. Looks around. At Sickbay. At
	the equipment, then at Beverly and Picard. She
	swallows. Worf ENTERS Sickbay. The woman takes one
	look at them and her head falls back on the table. Out
	"cold" again.

					PICARD

					BEVERLY
			She died of an embolism. It
			probably happened very suddenly,

	CLARE RAYMOND is handsome, not pretty. A solid,

	As the nurse (Nurse Wright) awakens him:

					DATA
			His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age
			sixty-three; occupation,
			financier.

					BEVERLY
			Advanced cardiomyopathy,
			inoperable at the time, but easily
			correctable now. He must have
			known for some time his condition
			was terminal.

	RALPH OFFENHOUSE was a power broker on both coasts
	who came up hard -- is used to being absolutely in
	charge. He too, is disoriented -- confused -- unsure.
	They MOVE to the last:

30   NUMBER THREE

					DATA
			Much of his file could not be
			retrieved. His name is L. Q.
			"Sonny" Clemonds. Apparently his
			occupation had something to do
			with music.

					BEVERLY
			There was marked deterioration
			of every system in his body.
			Probably due to massive chemical
			abuse. Unbelievable.

	L. Q. "SONNY" CLEMONDS has a lot of miles on his
	forty-seven years. He's passed his time with booze
	and drugs, and covered up the wear and tear with
	cosmetic surgery. His attention span is about
	twenty-eight seconds.

					PICARD
			That sounds like someone who hated
			life -- yet he had himself frozen
			so presumably he could go through
			it all again.

					BEVERLY
			Fear. Too afraid to live... too
			scared to die.

					PICARD
			Doctor, this seems to be a
			situation more suited to your
			talents. I will leave it in your
			hands.

	With a nod to Data to join him:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I'll be on the bridge.

			In a little while it should pass;
			then we can fully discuss what
			has happened. Nurse Wright will
			furnish you with anything you
			need.

					RALPH
			Not so fast. Is this part of the
			service or is it extra?

					BEVERLY
			I think it would be best if...

					RALPH
			I demand to know the cost of
			anything you do before the
			procedure is approved.

					BEVERLY
			I have no idea what you're talking

			I know this is all very confusing

					RALPH
			American?

					RIKER
			No -- we are a vessel of the United
			Federation of Planets. Earth is
			a member.

					RALPH
			What year is this?

			By your calendar... two thousand
			three hundred sixty-four.

					BEVERLY
			It's perfectly fine. In fact,

					RALPH
			I made it... It worked. I never
			believed this was...

					SONNY
				(pointing to Data)
			What's that?

					RIKER
			An android.

					SONNY
			You mean a robot?

					DATA
			Actually there is a distinct
			difference between a robot and
			an android.

					CLARE
			And him? The one I saw before
			with the... head.

	Riker is confused.

					BEVERLY
			She means Worf.

					RIKER
			Oh, he's a Klingon, and that
			requires a little more
			explanation.

					SONNY
			Guys... listen. I paid some idiot
			a lot of money to freeze me when
			I died. I need to hear the

					RIKER
			Oh, yes... absolutely.

			Great...

					CLARE
				(who has remained

			Excuse me. Would someone tell
			me what's going on?

					BEVERLY
			Well... About three hundred and
			seventy years ago you died of a
			massive embolism.

					CLARE
			I don't remember anything about
			it.

					BEVERLY
			You and the others were frozen.

					SONNY
			Cryonics -- you know... freeze you
			now... heal you later.

					CLARE
			I've heard about it; I just never
			paid it much mind. How did we
			get here?

					DATA
			Why were you in a module?

					SONNY
			The whacko who sold me this scam

33   CONTINUED: (3)

					RALPH
			Several cryonics companies had
			fallen into disrepute because of
			power failures which adversely
			affected their refrigeration
			system. Their stocks were
			severely depressed.

					SONNY
			The whole deal was a long shot...
			but I figured... what the hell,
			might as well give them the dough
			instead of leaving it to my
			ex-wives.
				(to Data)
			But you know, son, I figured it
			was just so much hooey.

					DATA
			Hooey? Accessing.
				(pause)
			Ah, as in malarkey... jive...
			bull... hogwash... an
			intentional fabrication.

					SONNY
			There you go, now you got it.

					RIKER
				(to Clare)
			If you didn't contract for this,
			who did?

					CLARE
			It must have been Donald -- my
			husband. If it was new and
			foolish, he'd have popped for it.
			Well, I'll say this. It's the
			first thing he ever bought into
			that worked.

					RALPH
			I, for one, never had a doubt.
			My stock in this company must have
			split a dozen times by now.

					DATA
			Actually the process of cryonics
			was never more than a fad, and
			did not continue much beyond the
			mid-twenty-first century.

					RALPH
			I need to make a phone call as

					RIKER
			A phone call?

					RALPH
			I have provided for myself. I
			have a substantial portfolio.
			It's critical I check on it. Let
			the bank know that I am alive and
			well.

					RIKER
			That's ah... going to be a little
			difficult right at the moment.

					RALPH
			Do you at least have a copy of The
			Wall Street Journal?

					RIKER
			I think we should take the

			Get adjusted to your new... ah...

					TROI
			They seem to be creatures of
			extremes. One moment violent
			beyond description, the next --
			tender. They're related to the
			Vulcans but as each developed,
			their differences grew wider.
			They are intensely curious. Their
			belief in their own superiority
			is beyond arrogance. For some
			reason they have exhibited a
			fascination with humans and that
			fascination, more than anything
			else, has kept the peace. One
			other thing, they will not

			No bars?! Don't tell me that,

	Sonny walks over to the computer.

					SONNY
			Now what?

					DATA
			Talk.

					SONNY
			I'd like me a thick Kansas City

				(he winks at Data)

	The drink is provided. He takes a sip and rears back
	surprised.

					DATA
			Is there something wrong?

					SONNY
			Wrong? Only that your computer
			here fixed just about the best

				(with a nod to Data)
			I just might get to like this

			Oh -- I think he means television,

			Or maybe catch up on the soaps.

			That particular form of entertainment

			That will be up to the captain.

					RALPH
			Well, get him in here. I have

					PICARD
			Report.

			We are six hours from the Neutral

			establish communications with any
			Federation colony or station in
			this vicinity.

					PICARD
			How many outposts are there in
			this sector?

					WORF
			Nine.

					RIKER
			I think we should go on the
			presumption that they've all
			been destroyed.

					GEORDI
			By the Romulans?

					RIKER
			It fits their historical pattern.

	Picard is very thoughtful.

					DATA
			Since there has been no contact
			with the Romulans for fifty-three
			years, seven months, eighteen
			days, we must consider that the
			information we do have, is out
			of date.

  STAR TREK: "... Neutral... " - REV. 3/22/88 - ACT THREE  32.

35   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			The positive side of that is their
			information about us is also out
			of date. Captain, I believe that
			lack of information is what this
			is all about.

					PICARD
			Continue, Number One.

					RIKER
			In my opinion, the Romulans want
			a confrontation... specifically
			against us.

					PICARD
			The Enterprise?

					RIKER
			Not by name; but yes, against us.
			They know the Federation will send
			their best -- this will be a
			perfect chance for them to learn
			firsthand, how much we have
			advanced in both technology, and
			technique.

					PICARD
			And your recommendation.

					RIKER
			I don't know if I have a specific
			recommendation. Perhaps we should
			consider taking the initiative.

					WORF
			I agree with Commander Riker.
			We may only have one opportunity;
			we should seize it.

					PICARD
			Data.

					DATA
			That strategy is built on a single
			premise. The hostile intent of
			the Romulans. If the premise is
			sound, so is the proposal.

					GEORDI
			If their intention isn't hostile,
			what is it?

					RALPH'S COM VOICE
			Captain Picard?

    STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - ACT THREE    33.

35   CONTINUED: (2)

	Surprised at the interruption.

					PICARD
			This is the captain, to whom am
			I speaking?

					RALPH'S COM VOICE
			Ralph Offenhouse. Captain, I need
			to talk to you.

					PICARD
			What's going on here, Number One?
			Did you give him permission to
			contact me?

					RIKER
			No, sir. He must have seen me
			use the com panel.

	Picard nods his understanding.

					PICARD
			Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We
			are in a very important conference
			right now and...

					RALPH'S COM VOICE
			I am sick and tired of being put
			off by you and your staff. This
			is the worst run ship I have ever
			been on. You could take some
			lessons from the Q-E Two. Now
			that's an efficient operation.

	Picard mutes the intercom.

					PICARD
			Data -- identify -- what's the
			Q-E-Two?

					DATA
			It was a passenger liner which
			mostly traveled Earth's Atlantic
			Ocean during the late twentieth
			and early twenty-first centuries.

					PICARD
			He's comparing the Enterprise to
			a cruise ship.

					RALPH'S COM VOICE

					RALPH
			... I think I have been very, very
			patient, especially under the

	Ralph composes himself quickly.

					RALPH
			Excellent.

	He steps forward with his hand out.

					RALPH
				(continuing)
			Now, we'll be able to get some
			things straight.

					PICARD
			Indeed we will. Those com panels
			are for official ship business.

					RALPH
			If they are so important, why
			don't they need an "executive
			key"?

					PICARD
			Aboard a starship, that is not
			necessary. We are all capable
			of exercising self-control. You
			will refrain from using them.

  STAR TREK: "... Neutral... " - REV. 3/24/88 - ACT THREE  35.

36   CONTINUED:

					RALPH
			Now just a minute.

					PICARD
			We are involved in a
			very serious and potentially
			dangerous situation.

					RALPH
			I'm sure that whatever it is seems
			very important to you. My
			situation is far more critical.

					PICARD
			I do not think you are fully aware
			of your situation, or the time
			which has passed.

					RALPH
			Believe me, I'm fully cognizant
			of where I am, and when. It is
			simply that I have more to protect
			than a man in your position could
			possibly imagine. No offense,
			but a military career has never
			been considered upwardly mobile.
			I must contact my lawyer.

					PICARD
			Your lawyer has been dead for
			centuries.

					RALPH
			Yes, of course I know that, but
			he was a full partner with a very
			important firm. Rest assured the
			firm is still operating.

					PICARD
			That's what this is all about...
			A lot has changed in three hundred
			years. People are no longer
			obsessed with the accumulation of
			"things". We have eliminated hunger,
			want, the need for possessions.
			We have grown out of our infancy.

					RALPH
			You've got it wrong. It's never
			been about "possessions" - it's
			about power.

    STAR TREK: "The Neutral Zone" - 3/17/88 - ACT THREE    36.

36   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Power to do what?

					RALPH
			To control your life, your

					PICARD
			That kind of control is an
			illusion.

					RALPH
			Really -- I'm here aren't I? I
			should be dead and I'm not.
			That's what money did for me.
			That's the kind of power I'm
			talking about.

	Off to the side, Clare begins softly weeping.

					PICARD
				(turning to her)
			What is it?

					CLARE
			I don't know. It just started

					TROI
			He must have thought you would

					CLARE
			I can tell you exactly what

			Lookie here what that young

					PICARD
			Wait. If that is a Romulan ship,
