                   FADE IN:

               1   TALL GRASS BLOWING GENTLY IN A BREEZE - DAY - (OPTICAL)      1

                   The sound of children playing, running through the
                   grass... as one boy (ARTIM, 12) pokes his head out, we
                   see by his facial skin pattern that he's an alien... his
                   cloths are simple, homespun. As other alien children
                   pursue him in a game of tag into the rocky foothills, we
                   BOOM UP to reveal a breathtaking view of a rural
                   community along a vast sparkling lake... mountains rising
                   in the background...some odd-like livestock graze
                   on the hillside...

               2   A FARM - LONG SHOT                                           2

                   A woman uses a bike pump to get well water...a man works
                   the soil in his fields, wipes his brow, waving to --

               3   A WOMAN (ANIJ, 38)                                           3

                   whose beauty immediately captivates us as she strolls
                   past the farm, the wind barely jostling her close cut
                   curly hair. She takes us to a busy outdoor farmers
                   market at the edge of a hand-constructed village set
                   against a natural rock face barrier. These are the Ba'ku
                   people and from the opening shots we can feel the simple
                   charms of this beautiful place... and who would blame us
                   for wanting to be there, to escape a life like this...
                   where people seem to have all the time in the world... to
                   chat with neighbors, taste a piece of fresh fruit and
                   enjoy the day... Anij nods hello to people including
                   SOJEF (male, 42), the community leader... she smiles as a
                   vendor slices a piece of fruit for her...

               4   NEW ANGLE - ANIJ - (OPTICAL)                                 4

                   From the point of view of the rock face behind the
                   village. Although we may not realize it yet, we are
                   watching through a window now... slightly discolored,
                   pulling back to see a mysterious figure in an isolation
                   suit standing incongruously beside her, his suit glowing
                   with a green force field. None of the Ba'ku are aware of
                   him as he takes readings with a sophisticated sensor
                   device built into his suit. Now our pullback reveals
                   we're inside a duck blind. Low lighting levels. A bi-
                   level gallery of Starfleet officers and members of an
                   alien race (the Son'a) observe the peaceful village scene
                   like sportswriters at the ballpark...

                   as they enter data into their computers. Supernumeraries
                   move in and out of the main viewing room with PADDS...

                   Outside, several other cloaked figures move among the
                   unknowing Ba'ku...

              11   ANGLE - THE RANKING SON'A OFFICER (GALLATIN, 60)            11
                   (OPTICAL)

                   Inside the duck blind. Like all Son'a, his face is
                   stretched like a rubber band about to snap...they look
                   like victims of three too many cosmetic surgeries. He
                   studies a PADD from a supernumerary...

                                           GALLATIN
                             Admiral Dougherty is waiting for
                             this. Transmit it to the ship.

                   Suddenly a communications crackle on loudspeakers...

                                           MALE SON'A COM VOICE
                             Alert, area twelve...!

                   Now the sound of a weapon blast... turmoil...As the
                   blast echoes through the hills, the Ba'ku outside the
                   window react, turn their heads toward the sound...

                                           MALE SON'A COM VOICE
                                     (distressed)
                             ... the android has...

                   It crackles off... Gallatin moves to a companel...

                   The running man starts pulling at his headgear.

                                           STARFLEET OFFICER #1
                             He's trying to remove the
                             headpiece...

              16   ANGLE - THROUGH WINDOW - (OPTICAL)                          16

                   as all the men in suits converge on the running man...
                   but with superhuman strength, he tosses them aside with
                   ease... Meanwhile Ba'ku people, unaware of the fight,
                   greet their children back, happy they're safe...

              17   EXT. MARKET - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL) - ANGLE ON ARTIM         17

                   as he moves to Sojef, his father...

                                           SOJEF
                             It must have been some kind of
                             odd electrical storm...

                   But as Sojef speaks, Artim turns to see the floating head
                   of Data DECLOAKING in mid-air barely a yard away as he
                   removes his helmet... the boy yells... jumps back,
                   falling as Data makes eye contact with him. The Ba'ku
                   scatter... Sojef pulls the boy away to safety...

                             Secondary protocols... active.

                   We notice a slashing burn wound on Data's neck as he
                   fights off an invisible force again... we hear a ripping
                   crunch and a green force field sputters briefly -- a Son'a
                   man in a torn isolation suit partially DECLOAKS as he is
                   slammed to the ground, unconscious. Data rips off the
                   rest of his suit revealing himself, picks up a weapon
                   from the unconscious Son'a, aims it at the rock face...

                   The observers dive for cover as he points the weapon this
                   way. But Data fires it to the left of the window...

              19   EXT. ROCK FACE - (OPTICAL)                                  19

                   And then fires again to the right... and again above...
                   each hit knocking out generators...
       
                   finally the rock face shimmers, like a computer image
                   breaking up, and disappears revealing the high-tech
                   stations behind it...

                   The scientists begin to poke their heads up from the
                   floor... exposed to the world outside...

              22   THE BA'KU IN HIDING PLACES                                  22

                   Close on the four Captain's pips on his uniform, and
                   moving back to reveal BEVERLY CRUSHER helping JEAN-LUC
                   PICARD fasten the collar on his jacket as DEANNA TROI
                   briefs him, glancing at a PADD. All are wearing formal
                   uniforms. They are running late.

                                           TROI
                             ... Population three hundred

                             You either need a new uniform or
                             a new neck.

                                           PICARD
                             'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar
                             size is exactly the same as it
                             was at the Academy.

                             Sure it is. And your hair is
                             still chestnut brown.

                   Our angle clearly establishes Picard's white hair... she
                   finishes with the collar... overlapping the above
                   dialogue: a chime at the door, Troi answers it, letting
                   in WILL RIKER in his dress uniform.

                             I guess they don't believe in
                             cocktails before dinner...

                   As Picard leads the way out of the door...

                             something that goes well with

                   Maybe thirty Starfleet officers, most human but a few
                   Bajorans, Trills and Borians peppered about... a small
                   group of musicians play a festive tune. The crowd moves
                   back as their Captain enters and Troi escorts him to
                   REGENT CUZAR, 50 and her delegation of about eight
                   extremely short aliens... she's at least a foot shorter

                   An aide steps forward and she takes an alien headpiece
                   from him and reaches up to put it on Picard's head...
                   Picard has to make himself shorter to make it work... the
                   other aliens throw tiny seeds over Picard and Cuzar (like
                   rice at a wedding)... Picard smiles, trying not to show
                   how silly he feels...

                   As Picard reacts, smiling with no recollection...

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             He's not acknowledging any
                             Starfleet protocols... not
                             responding to any of our hails...

                   We pull back to see we're in a small room off the
                   reception... Picard faces the monitor (he's removed the
                   headpiece). Geordi observes. A Starfleet Ensign stands
                   guard just outside the door to make sure they're not
                   disturbed.

                             precipitated his behavior?

                                           DOUGHERTY
                                     (shakes his head)
                             ... And now he's holding our
                             people hostage down there...

                                           PICARD
                             The Enterprise can be at your

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             That's probably not a good idea.
                             Your ship hasn't been fitted for
                             this region; there are
                             environmental concerns...

                                           PICARD
                             What kind of concerns?

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             We haven't fully identified the
                             anomalies yet. They're calling

                   The Ensign gives a puzzled reaction but an order is an
                   order. He exits. Geordi gives his Captain a curious
                   look.

                             going to stop by sector four-four-
                             one on our way to the Goren
                             system.

                   La Forge smiles, leaves. Picard takes a beat to collect
                   himself and we may sense how the clutter in a Captain's
                   life may wear him down. He puts the alien headpiece back
                   on with sullen eyes...  then restores his diplomat's face
                   and returns to the reception...

                   Low lighting. Strange futuristic dialysis machines pump
                   fluids in and out of reclined Son'a men and women... the
                   women use powder and heavy but carefully applied make-up
                   to obscure their faces. Son'a costumes are made of
                   expensive fabrics with latinum chains and exquisite
                   jewels as accessories, suggesting a wealthy culture that
                   values materialism. Sexy female attendants from various
                   alien races, dressed provocatively, work with laser tools
                   to repair cracked, raw skin off Son'a faces. We move to
                   find RU'AFO, 63, the Son'a Ahdar (Commander), reclining
                   getting an elaborate facial from two beauties, creams and
                   oils massaged into his skin by their gentle fingertips...

                             Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.

                   The tea appears as we pull back to reveal Picard studying
                   a PADD... he reaches out for the tea without his eyes
                   ever leaving his reading... walks across the room and
                   sits at a dining table that has stacks of various work
                   materials... more PADDS, charts and graphs and maps... a
                   half-eaten salad sits in front of him... and in a move
                   that would challenge the world's greatest juggler, he
                   pokes a fork of salad into his mouth with one hand as he
                   sips his tea with the other, finding a spot to prop the
                   PADD so he can still read... and now, his mind, asking a 
                   silent question, reaching over to grab a chart, and as he
                   pulls it over, he also spills the salad plate splashing
                   gorgonzolla dressing over his jacket... sighs... a chime
                   at the door...

                                           PICARD

                             Commander Riker...

                   Picard looks at himself, shrugs, what the hell...

                                           PICARD
                             Come...

                   Riker enters with a PADD, eyes drawn to Picard's stained
                   jacket...

                                           PICARD
                             I'm the casualty of a working 
                             lunch.

                   Picard takes off his jacket... and as the scene
                   continues, he changes.

                                           PICARD (CONT'D)
                             I've been going over the few star
                             charts we have of this "Briar

                             fluctuations...

                   Riker looks at the star chart, brushes it off...

                             ... and gorgonzolla cheese.

                             than one-third impulse in that

                             The only unusual readings were
                             low levels of metaphasic

                   Significantly electronic... many computer stations... a
                   few real books... Troi and Riker work at parallel
                   computer stations... people are at other stations...

                             planet with humanoid life six 
                             months ago. Turned out it's in
                             us to get approval for a 
                             sociological study. The

                             be a joint mission...

                             Why was Data assigned?

                             Sssshhh...

                   They turn to see -- a middle-aged, prune-faced woman at a
                   desk, looking sternly at them... Troi goes back to her
                   reading but seems distracted... sees a paper notepad on
                   the desk, rips off a shred and, during the following
                   exchange, starts to press it between her thumb and
                   forefinger into a little ball. Whispering now --

                                           RIKER
                             I don't see anything to suggest
                             the Son'a have any interest in
                             sociology...

                             What are they interested in...?

                             Wine, women and song.

                             You should feel right at home
                             with them.

                   She throws the ball of paper and hits Riker on the side
                   of the head... he turns but she's looking innocently at 
                   her screen... he rolls a little paper ball himself...

                             Hmm, I should feel right at home
                             with them...

                                           RIKER
                             You're in luck... it says here
                             they've taken women from several
                             races as indentured servants.

                   Just as he's about to throw his paper ball back at her...
                   he sees the librarian staring at him... Riker, caught,
                   sheepishly turns back to his computer... a beat...

                   She stands, leaning over Riker's shoulder to see his
                   computer, putting one arm on the desk...

                   as it rests gently on his upper arm... and he's deeply
                   aware of that breast touching him...

                             Why would we be involved with
                             these people?

                                           RIKER
                             Good question.

                   They exchange a brief glance that has nothing to do with 
                   the Son'a. As his eyes return to the computer scrolling,
                   she casually plays with hair at the nape of his neck...

                                           RIKER
                             You haven't done that in a long
                             time...

                                           TROI
                             What...?

                             Was I doing something to your
                             neck?

                   He pauses his scrolling as he comes to something
                   curious...

                             It says here that some form of
                             genetic damage has apparently
                             prevented the Son'a from
                             procreating...

                   Suddenly, a tiny ball of paper hits Riker...

                   He turns to see an alien ensign looking too innocently at
                   his computer. The librarian's eyes fix on Riker and
                   Troi, obvious troublemakers... Troi points to Riker...

                             He started it.

                   Riker reacts, starts to leave... Troi follows...

                   Dougherty pauses to consider but Ru'afo wants none of
                   Picard.

                             It isn't safe for you to remain
                             in this area.

                             He's right. Our shields have
                             been upgraded to protect against
                             the environmental anomalies...

                   Picard's position.

                             All right. You have twelve
                             hours, Captain. Then I want you
                             out of The Briar Patch. In the
                             meantime, we'll be heading out to
                             the perimeter to call for Son'a
                             reinforcements in case you fail.

                   having lunch, the Son'a quietly keeping to themselves at

                   coordination, well beyond human abilities.

                             to disarm yourselves. This
                             village is a sanctuary of life.

                   Picard measures the request... then holsters his
                   phaser... the rest of the away team does the same...

                             population.

                   Picard nods. They move off with Gallatin and the
                   Lieutenant. The work crew moves to disassemble the duck

                             We were under the impression they
                             were being held against their
                             will.

                             It's not our custom to have
                             guests here at all, let alone
                             hold anyone against their will.

                   Picard makes eye contact with Anij... her tone is not
                   harsh, but we can sense an inner strength in this woman.

                             would follow.

                                           TOURNEL
                             There did seem to be a phase
                             variance in the positronic matrix
                             that we were unable to repair.

                   Picard reacts, not the sort of thing one expects to hear
                   from someone in a place like this...

                                           ANIJ
                             I believe the Captain finds it
                             hard to believe that we'd have
                             any skills repairing a positronic
                             device...

                                           SOJEF
                             Our technological abilities
                             aren't apparent because we've
                             chosen not to employ them in our
                             daily lives. We believe when you
                             create a machine to do the work
                             of a man, you take something away
                             from the man.

                                           ANIJ

                                      lightly)
                             But at one time, we explored the
                             galaxy just as you do...

                                           PICARD
                             You have warp capability?
                                 
                                           ANIJ
                             Capability, yes. But where can
                             warp drive take us, except away
                             from here...?

                   Clearly establishing that she and her people have very
                   little interest in life beyond their world. Picard
                   allows himself to take in this glorious setting... a
                   humming bird hovers briefly nearby... it is the kind of
                   paradise that would appeal to any contemporary man trying
                   to escape the clutter of his life if only for a brief
                   respite... and at least, to that extent --

                             I understand.

                   In the background, the Starfleet hostages embrace their
                   hosts as they say farewell...

                             ... and because they have warp
                             capabilities, the consequences to
                             their society are minimal...

                             the hell out of there. How's
                             Data?

                             your way. Set a course to
                             rendezvous with us so you can

                             on your way out.

                             Dougherty out.

                   Picard turns off the monitor, glances at the pile of work
                   PADDS -- his "paperwork" -- on his desk without
                   pleasure... 

                   picks one up and begins to study it for a beat... then is 
                   drawn to the window, where he can see the warm inviting
                   planet below.

                   She's sitting on the sofa making some notes on a PADD
                   when the door chimes...

                                           TROI
                             Come in.
                                     (Riker enters)
                             Hi.

                                           RIKER
                             Got a minute? I... need a little
                             counseling.
                                     (off her surprise)
                             First time for everything. Do
                             I... lie down... or what?

                                           TROI
                             Whatever makes you comfortable...

                   Riker lies down, only he winds up with his head on her
                   lap looking up at her...

                                           TROI
                             This isn't one of the usual
                             therapeutic postures...

                                           RIKER
                             But it's comfortable.

                                           TROI
                             Why don't you try sitting up?

                                           RIKER
                             Or you could try lying down.

                                           TROI
                             You're in quite a mood today.

                   He finally sits up, stealing a kiss along the way... she
                   rises shocked but not upset...

                                           TROI
                             Do you really need counseling or
                             did you come down here to play?

                   Riker is on his feet now, approaching her. She retreats.

                                           RIKER
                             Both.
                                     (off her look)
                             I think I'm having a mid-life
                             crisis...

                                           TROI
                                     (retreating)
                             ... I believe you...

                                           RIKER
                             ... I'm not sleeping well...

                                           TROI
                             ... Doctor Crusher has something
                             that'll take care of that...

                   She allows him to catch her...

                                           RIKER
                             What I need, I can't get from
                             Doctor Crusher...
                                     (inches away)
                             Counselor, do you think it's
                             possible for two people to go
                             back in time to fix a mistake
                             they've made?

                                           TROI
                             On this ship, anything can
                             happen. And usually does.

                   He closes the gap between them, kisses her deeply.

                                           TROI
                             Augh.

                                           RIKER
                             Augh?

                                           TROI
                             I never kissed you with a beard 
                             before.

                   She pushes him out the door...

                                           RIKER
                             I kiss you and you say 'augh'?!

                   She hits the panel and the door slides closed in his
                   face... a tiny grin comes to her face...

                   La Forge has a headache he's trying to work through... he
                   shows Picard several burned components...

                                           LA FORGE
                             I took these out of Data's neural
                             net... they contain memory
                             engrams...

                                     (off Picard's look)
                             There's no doubt about it, sir.
                             That's what made Data
                             malfunction.

                             didn't fire until after he
                             malfunctioned.

                             I don't believe it happened that
                             way.

                                           PICARD
                             Why would they fire at him
                             without provocation?

                             functioning normally until he was
                             shot. Then, his fail-safe system
                             was activated...

                             So, you're saying he still knew
                             the difference between right and
                             wrong.

                             to take advantage of his memory
                             loss.

                             And yet he attacked us. And told
                             the Ba'ku we were a threat...

                   'Why?' is the unspoken question on Picard's face.

                   They reach a door with a significant security system in
                   place... Geordi hits several panels... Picard notices his
                   eye discomfort...

                             It's nothing. I'm just tired.

                   The door slides open to reveal a closet-sized space with
                   Data mounted on the wall in a diagnostic device... Geordi
                   touches a panel which activates Data...

                             Hello, Data...

                             Captain, Geordi...?

                             You're aboard the Enterprise.

                             You've had a serious malfunction.

                                           DATA
                                     (going inward a beat)
                             I seem to be missing several
                             memory engrams...

                   Geordi holds up the damaged components for him to see.

                                           DATA
                             Yes... that looks like them.

                                           PICARD
                             What's the last thing you
                             remember, Data...

                                           DATA
                                     (searching his

                             'his nose should pant and his lip
                             should curl...'

                                           PICARD
                             From the mission...

                                           DATA
                             I was in an isolation suit
                             collecting physiometric data on
                             Ba'ku children. My last memory
                             is going into the hills,
                             following a boy...

              87   EXT. VILLAGE - DAY - (OPTICAL)                              87

                   Artim is playing with a tiny 'palm-pet', a colorful cross
                   between a caterpillar and a jellyfish that crawls over
                   his hand and between his fingers, as Sojef moves over
                   with Picard and Data... the boy looks at Data with fear
                   in his eyes. Data can't help but notice...

                                           SOJEF
                             Artim, do you remember where you
                             were on the day of lightning
                             when the artificial lifeform
                             appeared to us?

                                           ARTIM
                             In the hills, by the dam.

                                           PICARD
                             Can you show us?

                   Artim puts his pet in a pocket (or it can have its own
                   little pouch on Artim's belt if he has no pockets) and 
                   leads  the way. Several Ba'ku including Anij and Tournel
                   curiously follow. As Picard makes eye contact with her,
                   she moves over...

                                           ANIJ
                             Haven't you disrupted our lives
                             enough...?

                   She says it gently, but honestly...

                                           PICARD
                             I understand how you feel. We 
                             just want to retrace Data's
                             movements that day...

                                           ANIJ
                             Why?

                                           PICARD
                                     (a cautious reply)
                             I don't like to leave questions
                             unanswered.

                                           ANIJ
                                     (evenly)
                             Then you must spend your life
                             answering questions.

                  She moves away. Picard watches her; she doesn't look
                  back.

             88   ANGLE ON DATA                                                88

                  Who notices Artim still glancing at him with fear. To
                  reassure him --

                                           DATA
                             There is no need for concern. I 
                             am operating within normal
                             parameters now.

                                           ARTIM
                             You're what?

                                           DATA
                             I am better.

                   The android's manner only seems to frighten Artim more.
                   Before Data can say anything else, Sojef comes and leads
                   him away, giving Data a cool smile that says, in effect,
                   I don't want any artificial lifeform talking to my son.
                   Data reacts. After a thoughtful beat, moves to walk with
                   Picard.

                                           DATA
                             I believe the boy is... afraid...
                             of me.

                                           PICARD
                             It's nothing personal data. You
                             have to remember these people
                             have rejected technology. And
                             you...

                                           DATA
                             ... I am the personification of 
                             everything they have rejected.

                                           PICARD
                             Until this week, that young man
                             probably never saw a  machine, let
                             alone one that walks and talks...

                                           DATA
                             And I do not believe I made a
                             very good first impression.
          
                   It clearly bothers Data to be the object of fear. The
                   boy glances over his shoulder once more at the android,
                   looks quickly away...

              89   LONG SHOT                                                   89

                   as the group moves into the rocky foothills...

              90   PICARD                                                      90

                   clutter.

                   They come to a brook. Artim hops on one foot across
                   rocks in the water and without stopping to think, Picard
                   does the same thing, looking like a little boy... then
                   notices a curious look from Data which makes him collect
                   himself and adjust his jacket. Anij glances over at
                   Sojef with concern. The others cross in adult fashion.

                             over there...

                   As they move along the rise...

                   a female hand with a straight razor moving to Riker's
                   face... his chin and cheeks lathered with cream... and
                   the hand is Troi's and they're in the bathtub together in
                   a bubble bath... she expertly moves the blade across his
                   face, leaving a swath of bare chin...

                   Dougherty in the foreground; behind him a Son'a physician
                   is pulling green scum from subcutaneous boils under the
                   skin of Ru'afo's neck with a syringe...

                             malfunctioned. His future in
                             Starfleet could depend on it.

                   Dougherty exchanges a concerned look with Ru'afo...

                             Dougherty out.

                   Ru'afo's eyes are closed, as the green goo moves from his
                   neck to the doctor's syringe...

                                           SON'A DOCTOR

                             this mission.

                   He opens his eyes, gives Dougherty a pointed look...

                   LAKE

                   Picard, Data and the Ba'ku have moved toward a dam where
                   Data is having trouble with is tricorder...

                                           DATA
                             Tricorder functions are limited
                             due to heavy deposits of
                             kelbonite in these hills...

                             How about a passive radiation
                             scan?

                   Data adjusts his tricorder... reacts...

                             Curious, there appear to be
                             strong neutrino emissions coming
                             from the lake...

                   Staying with Data s he follows the tricorder to the edge
                   of the lake... a brief pause... and then in a Harold
                   Lloyd sort of moment, he steps into the lake up to his
                   ankles, pauses again to look at the tricorder and then
                   disappears under water.

                             No.

                   The boy turns his wide eyes back toward the lake.

                   An eel and a fish investigate him as he stands on the
                   lake bottom, examining his tricorder...

                  Data emerges at a distance from the others... calling --

                             Sir, I believe I know what is
                             causing the neutrino emissions...

                   He climbs to the top of the earthen dam and turns a heavy
                   wheel that might usually require the strength of two men,
                   opening a floodgate... as he does --

                             Are there other machines like him
                             in the offland?

                             The offland is no concern of

                   The water continues to run off and as we push to the
                   falling water...

                   a strange displacement of water appearing as the lake
                   drains... something invisible is sitting in the water...

                   a bird lands on top of it... and as the water sinks
                   lower, spilling off the sides of the invisible object,
                   the shape is revealed to be that of a cloaked spaceship.

                             It is clearly Federation in
                             origin, Captain.

                             up.'

                   As they move to a rowboat... Artim begins to follow but
                   Sojef puts a firm arm on his shoulder.

                                           SOJEF
                             We're not interested in such
                             things.

                   Anij looks to Sojef...

                             I am.

                   And she hops onto the rowboat with Picard and Data...
                   decidedly not trusting either of them to go alone...

                                           PICARD
                             It might be wiser for you to stay
                             on shore.

                   Anij's answer is to grab an oar and push them away from
                   shore... as Data and Picard exchange a glance, Picard
                   takes the oar from her and...

                   Picard, Anij and Data row closer to the invisible ship.

                   Data presses controls on his tricorder. A hatch opens.
                   Picard and Data draw phasers...

                   As they climb in to find themselves in an identical image
                   of the Ba'ku village. Anij is stunned...

                                     (off tricorder)
                             It is a holographic projection.

                             What you're seeing is a computer
                             driven image created by photons

                             would someone want to create one
                             of our village?

                             to deceive the Ba'ku...

                             morning in this flying holodeck
                             transported en masse. A week
                             later, maybe a month, you've been
                             relocated on a similar planet
                             without ever realizing it.

                             I don't know.

                   We may notice a look in Anij's eyes - she knows why but
                   doesn't intend to say. Picard and Data don't notice her
                   reaction...

                   Suddenly wham! -- a plasma charge is fired from the
                   shadows of the "village" hologram... and then another and
                   another... the shots hit walls revealing portions of the
                   holo-grid (an effect we will see again later during the
                   final action). Plasma ricochets off the walls spraying
                   sparks over them all... as Data fires back, Picard grabs
                   Anij and shoves her out of the hatch for her safety...

                   as she falls several yards into the water making a big
                   splash... Picard turns back and starts firing...

                   A brief, intense exchange of shots... creating more gaps
                   in the holo-image... and finally a Son'a officer falls
                   off the roof of a holo-building, unconscious.

                             the vessel.

                   And as the holo-image DEMATERIALIZES, they're standing on
                   a holodeck.

                             probably the result of the

                   Austere but inviting with a warm fire... Sojef, Tournel
                   and Artim have joined them... Artim spoons hot cider from
                   a kettle into cups, serves it to the adults as the scene
                   continues...

                             We came here from a solar system
                             on the verge of self-
                             annihilation... where technology
                             had created weapons that
                             threatened to destroy all life.
                             A small group of us set off to
                             find a new home... a home that
                             would be isolated from the
                             threats of other worlds.

                             That was three hundred and nine
                             years ago.

                             Actually, I was a good deal older
                             when we arrived... in terms of my
                             physical condition.

                             There's an unusual metaphasic
                             radiation coming from the
                             planet's rings. It continuously
                             regenerates the cells in our
                             bodies. You must have noticed
                             the effects by now.

                             I suppose you're seventy-five.

                                           ARTIM
                             No. I'm twelve.

                             The metaphasic radiation won't
                             begin to affect him until he
                             reaches maturity...

                             To many offlanders, what you have
                             here would be more valuable than
                             gold-pressed latinum.

                             And I'm afraid it's the reason
                             that someone is trying to take
                             this world away from you.

                             The artificial lifeform was
                             right?

                             If not for Data, you'd probably
                             have been re-located by now.

                             we become one of them... we lose
                             everything we are...

                             conspiracy have tried to keep it
                             a secret. Not just from you, but
                             from my people as well.

                             survive, we had to remain apart.
                             It hasn't been easy. Many of the
                             young people here want to know
                             more about the offland... they're
                             attracted to stories of a faster

                             deserve. Of course, I'm tempted.

                             you ever experienced a perfect
                             moment in time?

                             It took us centuries to learn

                   Picard smiles, aware of a sexual tension... for the
                   second time in his visit, a humming bird flitters by,
                   briefly examining a street lamp and then away. She moves
                   inside, glances back and smiles. Then she's gone.
                   Picard turns and looks at the horizon where the sun will
                   come up soon... reacts as he sees --

             121   THE SILHOUETTE OF GEORDI LA FORGE - (OPTICAL)              121

                   standing there, looking out at the horizon...

                   eyes... without the implants... Geordi smiles...

                             wasn't anything wrong with my
                             implants. There was something
                             right with my eyes. When Doctor
                             Crusher removed the ocular
                             connections, she found the cells

                             If not, I just wanted, before we

                   Picard considers him a long beat... and they turn to see --

                   bathed in the sunlight... Picard's face looking younger,
                   contented in the new sun...

             125   THE SUNRISE - VARIOUS SHOTS                                125

                   above the water... the morning breeze brushing the red-
                   tinged field of tall grass.

                   as the sunlight cascades over the village and hills and
                   if we weren't sure this place was magic before, we
                   certainly know it now.

                   Dougherty and Ru'afo enter... Ru'afo is furious --

                                           RU'AFO
                             Am I to understand you're
                             not releasing my men, Captain?

                   Picard at his desk working, looks up, makes strong eye
                   contact with his guests...

                   That stops Ru'afo. He looks at Dougherty who realizes
                   some damage control will be necessary...

                             Ru'afo, why don't you let the 
                             Captain and I...

                   Ru'afo's face is so tight it seems it's going to break...

                                           RU'AFO
                             No!

                   ... and it does -- a crack opens up from his forehead to
                   his chin and blood dribbles out of it...

                                           RU'AFO (CONT'D)
                             This entire mission has been one
                             Federation blunder after another.
                             You will return my men or this
                             alliance will end with the
                             destruction of your ship.

                   He exits. Dougherty measures Picard for a beat...

                             On Earth, petroleum once turned
                             petty thugs into world leaders.
                             Warp drive transformed a bunch of
                             Romulan thugs into an empire. We
                             can handle the Son'a, I'm not
                             worried about that...
                                 
                                           PICARD
                             Someone probably said the same
                             thing about the Romulans a 
                             century ago.

                             With metaphasics, lifespans will
                             be doubled... an entire new
                             medical science will evolve...
                                     (beat)
                             I understand your Chief Engineer
                             has the use of his eyes for the
                             first time in his life... would
                             you take his sight away from him?

                                           PICARD
                             There are metaphasic particles
                             all over The Briar Patch. Why
                             must this planet be...

                                           DOUGHERTY
                                     (interrupting)
                             The concentration in the rings is
                             what makes the whole damned thing
                             work. Don't ask me to explain
                             it. I only know they inject
                             something into the rings that
                             starts a thermolytic reaction.
                             After it's over, the planet will
                             be unlivable for generations.

                                           PICARD
                             Delay the procedure. Let my
                             people look at the technology.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             Our best scientific minds already
                             have. We can't find any other
                             way to do this.

                                           PICARD
                             Then the Son'a can establish a
                             separate colony on this planet
                             until we do...

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             It would take ten years of normal
                             exposure to begin to reverse
                             their condition. Some of them
                             won't survive that long.
                             Besides, they don't want to live
                             in the middle of The Briar
                             Patch... who would?

                                           PICARD
                             The Ba'ku.

                   Picard and Dougherty look at each other a long beat.
                                 
                                           PICARD
                             We are betraying the principles
                             upon which the Federation was
                             founded... this is an attack on
                             the very soul of the Federation.
                                     (beat)
                             This will destroy the Ba'ku.
                             Just as cultures have been 
                             destroyed in every other forced
                             relocation throughout history.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             We are only moving six hundred
                             people, Jean-Luc.

                                           PICARD
                                     (beat)
                             How many people would it take...
                             before it becomes wrong? A
                             thousand? Fifty thousand. A
                             million?

                   Dougherty has taken this as far as he intends to.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             I'm ordering you to the Goren
                             system. File whatever protests
                             you wish to. By the time you do,
                             this will be all done.
                                     (moves to exit)
                             I'm also ordering the release of
                             the Son'a officers.

                   He's out. Picard sits at his desk for a long beat...

             130   INT. BRIDGE                                                130

                   Worf at Conn, Data at Ops, Riker at command... they look
                   up at Picard as he comes out of the Ready Room.

                                           PICARD
                             Prepare the ship for departure at
                             oh-seven-hundred hours.

                                           RIKER
                             Aye, sir.

                   Data exchanges a curious glance with Riker as Picard
                   crosses to the turbolift. Before he gets in, he turns
                   and looks at his bridge, imprinting it on his mind.
 
             131   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS                                     131

                   as he enters, stands in the middle of the room a long
                   beat, his table still cluttered with charts and PADDS...

             132   ANGLE - CLOSEUP - HIS DRESSER                              132

                   One pip is placed on top, a second, third and fourth...

             133   INT. SON'A BODY SCULPTURE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON A TOOTH       133
                   (OPTICAL)

                   as it's implanted into a very old man's mouth and now,
                   the old fellow has a mouthful of bright new teeth...
                   Gallatin enters, moving to --

             134   RU'AFO - (OPTICAL)                                         134

                   sitting, his head locked in position by an apparatus... a
                   female attendant actually giving him a facelift in front
                   of our eyes... the device stretching his face ever
                   tighter, as she snips off skin by one ear with a laser in
                   a bloodless surgery that heals his wound...

                                           RU'AFO
                             Gallatin! So the righteous
                             Starfleet Captain finally
                             released you. Did you encounter
                             any problems on the surface?

                                           GALLATIN
                                     (acknowledges)
                             No, sir. But it wasn't easy...
                             being among them...

                                           RU'AFO
                             I'm sure. Just don't forget what
                             they did to us.
                                     (Gallatin nods)
                             We'll have them rounded up in a
                             day or two... we needn't bother
                             with the Federation holo-ship
                             any more. Just get the holding
                             cells ready.

                   Gallatin acknowledges, leaves. To the attendant -

                                          RU'AFO
                             I'm going to miss these little
                             flesh-stretching sessions of
                             ours, my dear.

                    As she pulls up his other ear...

             135   INT. YACHT COCKPIT - (OPTICAL)                             135

                   Picard, out of uniform, works a transporter and cases of
                   military supplies MATERIALIZE on a loading platform that
                   will lower into the cargo hold of the yacht... he studies
                   a translucent geological scan of the surface that we will
                   hear more about later...

                                           DATA (O.C.)
                             Re-routing the transport grid to
                             avoid detection was wise, sir,
                             but the transporter is rarely
                             used after oh-two-hundred hours.

                   Picard turns to see Data, Troi, Crusher, La Forge, Worf
                   and Riker have entered the hatch. All but Riker and
                   Geordi are out of uniform.

                                           TROI
                             Taking the Captain's yacht out
                             for a spin?

                                           WORF
                                     (examining the cargo)
                             Seven metric tons of ultritium
                             explosives, eight tetryon pulse
                             launchers, ten isomagnetic
                             disintegrators...

                                           RIKER
                             You must be planning on doing
                             some hunting.

                                           PICARD
                             Go back to your quarters
                                     (no one moves)
                             That's an order.

                   No one moves.

                                           RIKER
                             No uniform? No orders.

                   Geordi, with his normal eyes, moves forward...

                                           LA FORGE
                             How could I look at another
                             sunrise, knowing what my sight
                             cost these people, Captain?

                   Picard looks at them with appreciation.

                                           DATA
                             I feel obliged to point out that
                             the environmental anomalies may
                             be stimulating certain rebellious
                             instincts common to youth that
                             could affect everyone's judgment.
                             Except mine, of course.

                                           CRUSHER
                             Okay, Data, what do you think we
                             should do?

                   Data looks to everyone, considering a beat... picks up a
                   phaser rifle... activates it...

                                           DATA
                             Saddle up. Lock and load.

                   The family united looks to their Captain for
                   instructions. Picard looks to them with deep affection.

                                           PICARD
                             They won't begin the procedure
                             while the planet is inhabited.
                             So, our job is to keep the planet
                             inhabited.

                   He looks at Riker and La Forge, knowing that his first
                   officer and chief engineer must stay with the ship.

                                           PICARD (CONT'D)
                             Go back and put a face on what's
                             happening here. Make the Council
                             see the Ba'ku. It's too easy to
                             turn a blind eye to the suffering
                             of an unfamiliar people.

                   Riker and La Forge acknowledge. Picard takes an extra
                   moment to look, perhaps for the last time, into the eyes
                   of his first officer with affection...

                                           PICARD
                             There's a short letter I left you
                             all, just some... sentimental
                             nonsense... the computer will
                             bring it to your attention at oh-
                             four-hundred... I'd just as soon
                             you delete it...

                                           RIKER
                             Fat chance. I'll post it on
                             every monitor on the ship...

                   Picard grins with nice embarrassment, then with a serious
                   look to Riker --

                                           PICARD
                             We'll hold out as long as we can.

                   Riker understands they're counting on him. Picard hits a
                   panel and the weapons sink into the yacht...

                   as the non-uniformed officers move to take their posts,
                   Riker takes Troi in his arms, kisses her good-bye. The
                   others react in surprise.

                             Apparently the environmental
                             anomalies are also stimulating...
                   
                   Worf shuts him up with a hard look... Data gets the
                   message, sits in a cockpit chair and quietly begins to
                   work...

                   falls away from the belly of the mother ship...

                   and after a beat, the thrusters ignite and off they go...

             137   INT. SON'A SHIP TACTICAL ROOM - (OPTICAL)                  137

                   Ru'afo watches a realistic simulation of a space
                   procedure on a monitor... a small but sophisticated
                   injector assembly sailing into the planet's rings begins
                   to fire charges that start a thermolytic reaction (we see
                   only the early stages here)... Gallatin enters with a
                   PADD...

                             The injector performs perfectly
                             in every simulation...

                                           GALLATIN
                             Sir, as the Enterprise left
                             orbit, one of their support craft
                             went down to the surface.
                                     (Ru'afo reacts, takes
                                       the PADD)
                             It appeared to be the Captain's
                             Yacht. Five persons on board.

                                           RU'AFO
                             We're not waiting until
                             morning... take the shuttles and
                             get everyone off the surface
                             tonight.

                   Gallatin starts to leave... pauses as --

                             Gallatin, if Picard or any of his
                             people interfere... eliminate
                             them.

                   On a door opening... as we hear a bell ringing... the
                   face of Artim fills the screen... his eyes scared... and
                   as we reveal his point of view of the village, it's a
                   stunning sight -- Tournel pulling on the warning bell in
                   the square... hundreds of people moving with urgency...
                   supplies are being packed onto the backs of llamas...
                   Worf, Data and Troi are unpacking the cases of military
                   supplies that have already been loaded from the
                   (unseen) yacht... Picard is going over charts with Anij 
                   and Sojef near-by...

                             What's happened? Is something
                             wrong?

                             We're leaving the village...

                             food... we may not be back for
                             days...

                   Artim jumps with a start as a slim, high-tech device on a
                   stake suddenly lights up like a Christmas tree beside
                   him... sees Data who just activated it...

                             It is a transport inhibitor. It
                             will help prevent Son'a ships
                             from beaming anyone off the
                             surface...

                   Artim, overwhelmed and still scared of the android, backs
                   away from Data without responding and moves toward his
                   father. Picard is showing Anij and Sojef the translucent
                   geo-scans we saw on the yacht...

                             they'll have with their

                             keep us close to these

                   Artim moves beside his father, holds onto him...

                             inhibitors to compensate. The
                             mountains have the highest
                             concentrations. Once we're
                             there, transport will be
                             virtually impossible...

                             that, Mister Worf.

                   They all react to the sound of thrusters flying
                   overhead... they look up to see --

                   officers separated at intervals among them, continuing to
                   encourage and assist them forward... progress slows as

                   parallel to the path ahead... voices raise in fear,

                   As he falls, the little palm-pet slips out of his
                   pocket... Artim desperately tries to save him from being
                   stepped on, finally snatches him in his hand. But now
                   the crush of people threatens to trample the boy and it's
                   a reminder how scary it can be to be small. Suddenly, an
                   arm reaches down and scoops him up... and as we follow
                   Artim up, we can see it's Data who has rescued him...
                   their eyes connect briefly as Data carries him forward...

                             Picard.

                                           RU'AFO
                             Talk... we should send down an
                             assault team and take them by
                             force.

                             That is not an acceptable option.
                             If people get hurt, all the
                             support we have in the 
                             Federation...

                                           RU'AFO
                             Federation support, Federation
                             procedures, Federation rules...
                             look in the mirror, Admiral...
                             the Federation is old... in the
                             last twenty four months, it's
                             been challenged by every major
                             power in the quadrant -- the
                             Borg, the Cardassians, the
                             Dominion... they all smell the
                             scent of death on the Federation.
                             That's why you've embraced our
                             offer... because it will give
                             your dear Federation new life.
                             Well, how badly do you want it,
                             Admiral? Because there are hard
                             choices to be made now. If the
                             Enterprise gets through with news
                             about their brave Captain's
                             valiant struggle on behalf of the
                             defenseless Ba'ku, your
                             Federation politicians will
                             waver, your Federation opinion
                             polls will open a public debate,
                             your Federation allies will want
                             their say... need I go on?

                   Dougherty takes a deep breath... knows Ru'afo is right.
                   Gallatin hates the idea of a violent assault, gives
                   Dougherty the other option he's desperately seeking --

                                           GALLATIN
                             There is an alternative to an all-
                             out assault. Isolinear tags
                             would allow our transporters to
                             lock on to them.

                                           RU'AFO
                             We'd have to tag every one of
                             them... that would take time...
                             and we don't have it. The
                             Enterprise is only nineteen hours
                             from communications range with
                             the Federation...

                             I'll order Riker to turn around.

                                           RU'AFO
                             Picard's first officer. Do you
                             really believe he'll listen?

                   Ru'afo's clearly lost faith in the Admiral's ability to
                   control the situation... Dougherty's jaw tightens...

                                           RU'AFO
                             My ships are capable of
                             intercepting the Enterprise
                             before it reaches the perimeter.
                             I could send them to... escort...
                             it back... but Commander Riker
                             might not want to come...

                   And we slowly push into Dougherty as he steps across his
                   self-imposed moral line...

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             Send your ships.

                   Dougherty tries to digest the knot in his stomach...

                   Deep into the foothills now... much steeper terrain...
                   feeling the power of the mountains near-by... seeing the
                   path below as hundreds of Ba'ku and dozens of llamas wind
                   their way up... it's almost biblical in scope with Picard
                   and Moses leading the way...

                   struggling inside to reconcile what he's been taught
                   about machines and the experience he's had with Data...

                             My father told me I shouldn't
                             talk to you.

                             I don't.

                   They exchange a glance. Artim sighs, troubled.

                             Not everyone here agrees with
                             him. I mean, you know, about
                             machines. There was even a 
                             big fight about it once.

                             So people like us won't be afraid
                             of you any more.

                             Perhaps, that is true.

                   The boy is obviously tired from miles of walking
                   uphill...

                   Data studies him... (and it should be noted that his
                   responses are a deliberate attempt to enlighten Artim,
                   give the child a new perspective on what it means to be

                             imagine what it would be like to
                             be a child...

                             the next. I am surprised that
                             you do not... trip over your own

                             like to be a child', you need to
                             learn how to play...

                   As Data considers...

             154   WITH PICARD AND ANIJ                                       154

                   at point...

                   walking up a part of the trail protected by towering
                   rocks. Worf approaches from the rear... (Note: we may
                   notice more physical changes in our people because of the
                   regenerative process. For example, Picard's hair is
                   darker and there actually seems to be a touch more of it
                   growing than before... Worf's hair is more straggly,
                   unkempt...)

                                     (not serious)
                             You need a haircut, Commander.

                             experienced by Klingons during

                             Roughly translated: puberty...
                             although for a Klingon that's not
                             doing it justice...
                                     (to Worf)
                             Any severe mood swings, unusual
                             aggressive tendencies -- be sure
                             to let me know right away...

                             The Ba'ku could use some rest,
                             sir. According to the geo-scan,
                             this may be the safest area for
                             the next few kilometers...

                                           PICARD
                             Very well. We'll take an hour.
                             Break out some rations...

                   Worf acknowledges, signals and the column lumbers to a
                   halt... people sit along the trail...

             155   AROUND THE BEND - (OPTICAL/MATTE)                          155

                   A spectacular view of the mountains ahead... Picard and
                   Anij move forward through some brush, lay on their
                   stomachs as Picard uses 24th century field glasses to
                   examine the path ahead...

                                           ANIJ
                             Right beyond that ridge is where
                             the caves begin... we can hide
                             for days...

                                           PICARD
                             By now the Son'a have scanned the
                             area and know that just as well
                             as we do.

                   She studies him as he continues to survey the territory
                   they must still cross... on a whim, she reaches out and
                   runs a finger across his bald head... he looks up,
                   surprised...

                                           ANIJ
                                     (smiles)
                             It's been three hundred years
                             since I've seen a bald man.

                   He grins, studies her... they feel the sexual tension...
                   after a beat...

                                           PICARD
                             How is it a woman like you never
                             married? And don't tell me you
                             "just haven't gotten around to it
                             yet"...

                                           ANIJ
                             What's the rush?

                                           PICARD
                                     (beat)
                             I should warn you... I've always
                             been attracted to older women...

                   She looks seriously at him, takes his hand in hers,
                   guides both hands to touch his cheek.

             156   PICARD'S SUBJECTIVE POV - (OPTICAL)                        156

                   ... and in that moment, his perception and our view 
                   begin to move down her arm... and we enter...

             157   AN ALTERED REALITY - (OPTICAL)                             157

                   Picard, and we, find ourselves in a heightened state of
                   sensory perception -- time seems to be slowing down to a
                   crawl, sounds are sharper... we hear Picard's heart
                   beating slowly with a booming percussion... he follows her 
                   gaze to see yet another humming bird, hears its languid wing
                   motion... swirling dust from the mountain seems like a 
                   zipping scarf in a breeze that plays in his ears like a
                   natural flute... his breath becomes more even as he
                   relaxes into this altered state and he feels...

             158   HER FINGERS                                                158

                   gently touching the hair at the top of his chest,
                   sensing, even hearing, her fingertips against his flesh.

             159   HER LIPS                                                   159

                   brush his cheek, his lips... her teeth nip gently on his
                   lower lip, tugging it and then her lips press against his
                   for an eternity...

                             them.

                   Nara sends the message... a beat...

                             Why not?

                   Boom... a small explosion well off target... the ship
                   shakes gently...

                             someone.

                   Another boom shakes them slightly...

                                           TOURNEL
                             Anij went to find Artim...
          
                                           ANIJ (O.C.)
                             I've got him.

                   At the sound of her voice, Picard moves toward the main
                   cavern...

             223   ANGLE - INTO THE CAVERN                                    223

                   And we see Anij and Artim maybe thirty yards away from
                   Picard... running now... coming this way... suddenly,
                   wham... a rocket hits the mountainside and the ground
                   shudders... and the ceiling starts to collapse... and...

             224   PICARD'S EYES                                              224

                   Picard reaches out for her... just as the whole thing
                   comes down on both of them... Picard throws Artim out of
                   the cave just in front of the collapse into the arms
                   of...

             227   DATA                                                       227

                   who pulls him safely away from the collapse... The
                   Starfleet officers move back to examine the collapsed
                   mouth of the cave...

                                           ARTIM
                             Anij!

                                     (to Artim)
                             Tournel will take you the rest of
                             the way...

                                           ARTIM
                             No... I want to stay with you...

                                           DATA
                             It is safer there. I will join
                             you shortly.

                   Artim reluctantly goes and the last people cross the
                   divide with Tournel. Overlapping the above dialogue --

                             There are almost four metric tons
                             of rock blocking our way...

                   She aims a phaser at the rocks, but Worf stops her...

                                           WORF
                             That might cause another cave-in.

                   They have no choice... they start digging furiously...
                   Data picking up rocks that no human could lift...  Worf
                   refusing to surrender to his own physical limitations...
                   Beverly and Troi do the best they can... Tournel takes

                   Almost pitch black... finding Picard under rubble, his
                   face cut, dazed, shaking himself back to consciousness...
                   hoarsely cries out for...

                                           PICARD
                             Anij...

                   He gropes around for her...

                             We're trying to get to you,
                             sir...

                   Picard begins to crawl around in the darkness and finally
                   comes to motionless body of Anij...

                                           PICARD
                             Anij.

                   She barely opens her eyes... Picard looks to see if he
                   still has his tricorder; he does... he trains it on
                   her... the reading are not good...

                                           PICARD
                             Help is coming.

                   She looks at him and tries to smile, but it's too much...
                   and her eyes close... and the tricorder tells Picard
                   she's on the edge of death...

                             I understand. Tell Doctor
                             Crusher to have a hypospray of

                             I'm losing her.

                             We're coming.

                   Picard takes Anij's hand and holds it to his own cheek...

                                           PICARD
                             Stay with me... don't let go of
                             this moment, Anij... help me find
                             the power to make you live in
                             this moment... just one more
                             moment... and then one more after
                             that... and one more after that.

                   Her eyes weakly open one last time and look at him...and
                   as their eyes connect... once again...

                   as his consciousness moves down her arm and as the bond
                   is formed... he experiences --
   
             230   AN ALTERED REALITY - (OPTICAL)                             230

                   with heightened senses again as time seems to slow down,
                   her eyelids thumping slowly louder and louder... and as
                   they hold the moment the cavern seems to light up with
                   the metaphysical energy they're emanating... and it's
                   like Picard has thrown her a mystical lifeline to hold
                   onto... his eyes are her eyes as life seeps into them...
                   the moment seems to last forever... she smiles gently and
                   finally sunlight cracks into the cavern as Data and Worf
                   break through... Crusher crawls in and uses the
                   hypospray an Anij's neck... measures her lifesigns with
                   the tricorder, smiles at Picard...

                                           CRUSHER
                             She's stabilizing.

                                           PICARD
                             Is it safe to move her?

                                           CRUSHER
                             Safer than leaving her here.

                   Picard kneels and picks her up in his arms... Anij looks
                   weakly at him...

                                           ANIJ
                             And you thought it would take
                             centuries to learn.

                   He smiles with affection at her... and they all exit...

                   we understand a classic showdown is imminent... an
                   O.K. Corral moment... and all this happens very fast: our
                   people stand shoulder to shoulder each a yard apart...
                   Picard gently lowers Anij to the ground... Worf tosses
                   him a spare phaser rifle... as he catches it...

                   Our people react... move, duck and roll, tags just
                   missing them, as they fire back... only Picard stands
                   motionless on one knee protecting Anij... one, two,
                   three, four drones are destroyed but the fifth fires,
                   tagging Anij... Picard instantly reaches for her tag, but
                   then he feels the sting of...

                   escorted by Gallatin, enters a cavernous brig filled with
                   Ba'ku, perhaps as many as eighty of them...his eyes
                   looking for --

                   stroking Anij's hair as she lies weakly next to him and
                   Sojef. A beat as he locks eyes with Dougherty.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             Order them to surrender, and I
                             promise you won't be court-
                             martialed.

                                           PICARD
                             If a court-martial is the only
                             way to tell the people of the
                             Federation what happened here,
                             then I welcome it.

                   Ru'afo enters, controlled rage, hands a PADD to
                   Dougherty.

                                           RU'AFO
                             The Enterprise has destroyed one
                             of my ships. The other is on
                             fire, requesting assistance.

                   A beat. Picard reacts as Dougherty studies the PADD.

                                           PICARD
                                     (to Dougherty)
                             The Enterprise would only fire if
                             it were defending itself. Ru'afo
                             must have ordered the attack.

                             I can't believe he would've given
                             that order without your consent,
                             Admiral.

                   Dougherty maintains eye contact but has completely lost

                                     (to Ru'afo)
                             There's nothing further to be
                             gained from this...

                                           RU'AFO
                             You're right. This is going to
                             end now.
                                     (to Picard)
                             The Ba'ku want to stay on the
                             planet. Let them. I'm going to
                             launch the injector...

                   Gallatin's face reacts to that...Picard sees his sharp
                   displeasure and then for an instant their eyes meet.
                   Gallatin looks away, but Picard registers the
                   information.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             You're not going to launch 
                             anything until...

                                           RU'AFO
                             In six hours, every living thing
                             in this system will be dead or
                             dying.

                   He starts to exit...

                                           PICARD
                             You would kill your own people,
                             Ru'afo? Your own parents, your
                             brothers, sisters...
                                     (off Dougherty's look)
                             Didn't you know, Admiral? The
                             Ba'ku and the Son'a are the same
                             race.

                   Dougherty, confused, looks to Ru'afo... who doesn't look
                   back... Sojef stands and comes forward... to Ru'afo --

                                           SOJEF
                             Which one were you? Gal'na...
                             Ro'tin...Belath'nin... I'm
                             sorry, I don't recognize you...

                                           RU'AFO
                             Those names, those children are
                             gone forever.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             What is he talking about?

                                           SOJEF
                             A century ago, a group of our
                             young people wanted to follow the
                             ways of the offlanders. They
                             tried to take over the colony...
                             and when they failed...

                                           RU'AFO
                             When we failed, you exiled us.
                             To die slowly.
         
                   Anij gathers the strength to look at him...

                                           ANIJ
                             You're Ro'tin, aren't you...?
                             There's something in the voice.
                                     (to Gallatin)
                             Would you be his friend Gal'na?
                                     (Gallatin looks away)
                             I helped your mother bathe you
                             when you were a child. She still
                             speaks of you.

                                           PICARD
                                     (to Dougherty)
                             You've brought the Federation
                             into the middle of a blood feud,
                             Admiral. The children have
                             returned to expel their elders...
                             just as they were once expelled.
                             Except Ru'afo's need for revenge
                             has now escalated to parricide.

                   Ru'afo exits. Gallatin looks at Sojef and then follows.
                   Dougherty is a lost man, realizing his tragic errors.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             It was for the Federation. It
                             was all for the Federation.

                   Picard offers no sympathy... Dougherty turns and exits...

             244   INT. SON'A BODY SCULPTURE CHAMBER - (OPTICAL)              244

                   Deserted as Ru'afo enters, his face full of tension... he
                   moves to a device that bombards his face with pulsating
                   green energy, trying to relax... Dougherty enters...

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             We're taking this ship out of
                             here... this mission is over...

                                           RU'AFO
                             It is not over.

                                           DOUGHERTY
                             It is over.

                   Ru'afo moves away from the device and grabs Dougherty
                   roughly... moving him across the room...

                                           RU'AFO
                             I do not take orders from you.
                              
                                           DOUGHERTY
                             If you begin the procedure while
                             the planet is still populated,
                             the Federation will pursue you
                             until...

                   Ru'afo, more powerful than Dougherty, throws him down
                   into one of the treatment chairs...

                                           RU'AFO
                             The Federation...

                   He locks Dougherty's head into the device... switches
                   several panels... the device lights up ominously...

                                           RU'AFO (CONT'D)
                             ... will never know what happened
                             here.

                   He hits a switch and begins to raise Dougherty's ears in
                   the facelift procedure we saw before... Dougherty
                   struggles but Ru'afo holds him down... as the Admiral's
                   twists and morphs into a grotesque facelift that
                   finally strangles him to death.

                   Ru'afo enters...Gallatin and officers on duty...

                                           RU'AFO
                             Admiral Dougherty will not be
                             joining us for diner. Deploy
                             the collector.
                                     (Gallatin hesitates)
                             Do you have a problem with those
                             orders?

                                           GALLATIN
                             May I talk to you alone?

                                           RU'AFO
                                     (to another officer)
                             Deploy the collector.

                   The officer complies.

                                           GALLATIN
                             Moving them is one thing.
                             Killing them all...

                                           RU'AFO
                             No one hated them more than you,
                             Gal'na.
                                     (beat, intimately)
                             We've come a long way together.
                             This is the moment we've planned
                             for so many years...

                   Gallatin looks at his friend, his commander... Ru'afo
                   pats him encouragingly on the shoulder...

                                           RU'AFO
                             Separate the Starfleet personnel
                             and secure them in the aft cargo
                             hold... see that Picard joins
                             them...

                                           GALLATIN
                             The shields in that section won't
                             protect them against the
                             thermolytic reaction...

                                           RU'AFO
                             Thank-you for reminding me.

                   He sits in his command seat and watches his viewscreen...

                   as huge hatches open and the particle collector that will
                   capture the metaphasic radiation from the rings slowly
                   extends out in both directions. After a beat, Gallatin
                   exits... push in to Ru'afo...

             247   INT. COLLECTOR - (OPTICAL)                                 247

                   an Astrodome-sized chamber full of weird crisscrossing
                   patterns of pipes, conduits, cables, and rails -- all of
                   them stretching slowing outward as the collector expands.

                   begin to unfurl majestically in front of the planet's
                   rings... and now we recognize it as the remarkable device
                   we saw earlier in Ru'afo's simulation.

                   Picard has climbed the rear wall with help from two
                   Ba'ku, examines the forcefield generators in the ceiling.

                                           ANIJ

                             Jean-Luc...

                   Gallatin arrives... armed with a hand weapon. Aiming it
                   at Picard, he turns off the forcefield...

                                           GALLATIN
                             Come with me.

                   Picard measures him for a moment then comes out, smiles
                   'don't worry' to Anij... Gallatin restores the field and
                   motions for Picard to exit...

                   walking to a turbolift... unusually cordial considering
                   the circumstances --

                                           PICARD
                             It must have been very strange
                             for you.
                                     (off his look)
                             When you were a hostage. Being
                             among the friends and families
                             you knew so many years ago. All
                             of them looking exactly as they
                             did. Almost like... looking
                             through the eyes of childhood
                             again.

                   Gallatin presses a panel at the lift... Picard fixes his
                   eyes on him, evenly --

                                           PICARD
                             And here you are trying to close
                             those eyes again... to pretend
                             you can't see what the bitterness
                             has done to your people... what
                             it's done to Ru'afo... and to
                             you
                                     (beat)
                             It's turned you... into a coward.
                                     (off his reaction)
                             A man who ignores his conscience.

                   The turbolift arrives...

                                           GALLATIN
                            Get in.

                   Picard enters...

                             A coward... without the moral
                             courage to stop an unspeakable

                             Is this how a Federation officer
                             begs for his life?

                                           PICARD
                             I'm not begging for my life. I'm
                             begging for yours.
                                     (beat)
                             There is still a way home,
                             Gal'na.

                   Gallatin looks at Picard a long, miserable beat, then...

                   The doors close. Gallatin lowers his weapon.

                             What you're asking me to do... is
                             impossible... the crew is loyal
                             to Ru'afo...

                             injector?

                             But I would need at least three
                             minutes on the bridge.

                                           PICARD
                             If we could lure him away from

                             It doesn't matter where he is.
                             As soon as he realizes something
                             is happening, he'll override my
                             commands with one word at his com-
                             link...

                                     (beat, an idea)
                             What if he doesn't realize
                             something's happening...
                                     (Gallatin reacts,
                                      confused)
                             Can you get me to a transmitter?
                             I have to speak with Worf and
                             Data on the surface... we'll need
                             their help...

                   As Gallatin acknowledges, still uncertain what Picard's
                   up to...

                   holding onto the grill... trying to force him to let
                   go...

                   grimaces, looks to see:

                   The ignition matrix engages and the nitrogen flow that
                   follows throws Ru'afo slightly off-balance... Picard
                   knowing it's now or never, releases one hand and grabs
                   Ru'afo by the neck and yanks his head down hard against
                   the grill, stunning him... Picard pulls himself up and
                   moves quickly into the blinding nitrogen toward the
                   detonation circuit again...

                   he literally disappears for a brief second... as Ru'afo
                   comes back at him again... the countdown at :10... Ru'afo
                   pulls him away from the controls... :05... Picard leaps
                   for the plank he crawled over on... Ru'afo looks at...

             297   HIS POV - THE DETONATION CIRCUIT                           297
  
                   and it's gone!

             301   TWO SHOT: PICARD AND RU'AFO - (OPTICAL)                    301

                   perhaps no more than a foot apart... but an instant
                   later, Ru'afo slides away with the injector as it's
                   launched... a protective forcefield zaps into place as it
                   enters space... Picard watches as it moves toward the
                   rings...

                   As we saw in the simulation, the injector continues to
                   move toward the rings...

             303   INT. INJECTOR - ANGLE THROUGH THE FORCEFIELD - (OPTICAL)   303

                   to see the rings getting closer and closer... and as we
                   burst into them... the bright colorful metaphasic dust
                   and gases swirling around us like a hurricane...

             304   RU'AFO - (OPTICAL)                                         304

                   begins to change... growing younger and younger... face-
                   lift falls into middle-age... then taking on the Ba'ku
                   facial skin pattern as he reaches young adulthood... then
                   adolescence... then childhood. White out.

                   The Ba'ku returning from the hills... Troi waves from a
                   distance... and we move to see Riker, standing with Worf
                   (back in uniform), waving back...

                                           WORF
                             Have I mentioned the
                             unanticipated rewards I've
                             discovered in a permanent
                             relationship...?

                                           RIKER
                             'Permanent'... that sounds like a
                             long time, Worf.

                                           WORF
                                     (with irony)
                             Life is short, Commander.

                   Worf leaves Riker to think about that... and as we move
                   away with him, he takes us to Gallatin watching the
                   children play tag in the high grass with a personal
                   longing.

             306   ANGLE TO SEE PICARD, ANIJ AND SOJEF - (OPTICAL)            306

                   walking slowly observing Gallatin. Anij is almost fully
                   recovered. Picard is back in uniform.

                                           SOJEF
                             I wish there was a way to bring
                             them back home.

                                           PICARD
                             Ask them.

                                           SOJEF
                             I'm afraid there's too much
                             bitterness... on both sides.

                   They pause as they notice Crusher escorting a young Ba'ku
                   woman... returning from the mountains... she tries to
                   recognize Gallatin... we're too far away to hear what is
                   said... but the woman embraces Gallatin as a mother
                   embraces a lost son... and Crusher looks over and smiles
                   to Picard... before she leaves the couple alone...  Anij
                   looks to Picard, realizing --

                                           ANIJ
                             Mother and son. You arranged
                             this...?

                                           PICARD
                             I thought it might begin the
                             healing process.

                   Sojef considers Picard, shakes his hand with a unstated
                   but deep appreciation for all that this offlander has
                   done. He moves away to join Gallatin and his mother.
                   Anij looks to Picard with love.

                                           ANIJ
                             What am I going to do without
                             you?

                   Picard reacts, slightly surprised that she has
                   anticipated that he has to go.

                                           PICARD
                             These are perilous times for the
                             Federation. I can't abandon it
                             to people who would threaten
                             everything I've spent a lifetime
                             defending.

                             I'm going back to Earth to...
                             slow things down... at the
                             Federation Council.

                   She nods, she knows...

                                           PICARD
                             But I have three hundred and
                             eighteen days of vacation time
                             coming. I plan on using them.

                                           ANIJ
                             I'll be here.

                             Worf moves over...

                                           WORF

                   They turn to see a Ferengi (QUARK) approaching in a
                   bathing suit with a beach umbrella and two barely dressed
                   Dabo girls...

                                           WORF
                             What are you doing here, Quark?

                                           QUARK
                             The same thing everyone else in
                             the quadrant is going to be doing
                             here... as soon as I build the
                             greatest spa in the galaxy...
                                     (sotto)
                             ... these people don't have any
                             religious thing about casinos do
                             they...?

                                           PICARD
                             There aren't going to be any spas
                             on this planet.
                   
                                           QUARK
                             Do I know you?

                             Federation protectorate, which
                             will end any and all attempts at
                             exploitation by people like you.

                                           QUARK
                             Explain to me how five thousand
                             time-share units... right there
                             along the lake... would be
                             'exploiting' anyone.

                                           PICARD
                             Mister Worf, have this
                             uninvited... offlander and his
                             quests beamed to the Enterprise.
                             We'll deposit them at Deep Space

                             Must you, sir?

                   Worf takes Quark away by the scruff of his beach shirt...
                   his disappointed babes follow ...trailing away --

                             You'll hear from my Nagus.

                   They're gone.

                             Do you really think your mighty
                             Federation would be interested in
                             protecting six hundred people?

                             The "mighty" Federation could
                             learn a few things from this
                             village...

                   He kisses her. The signature humming bird appears,
                   sweeping up in the breeze and hovers briefly in front of
                   them... and as he takes her hand to his cheek...

                   slows... its wing movements becoming more fluid and
                   gentle... as the moment extends...

             309   ANGLE - THE HIGH GRASS                                     309

                   a shot like our opening shot...except the head that
                   peeks through the grass this time is Data's... and as we
                   widen, we see he has taken Artim's earlier advice and is
                   playing tag with all the kids...

                                           CRUSHER

                             Data! It's time to go!

                   Data stands up straight as he hears the voice, looks at
                   Artim a long beat... and this is a kid's moment,
                   underplaying the sentiment the way kids would...

                                           DATA
                             I have to go home now.

                                           ARTIM
                             Bye.

                   Data nods...

                                           DATA
                             Bye.

                   Artim smiles as Data joins the others...

                                           ARTIM
                             Don't forget -- you've got to 
                             play a little bit every day.

                   Data acknowledges...

                             Good advice.

                   Riker takes Troi's hand suggesting perhaps a new
                   permanent commitment. Picard moves to join the others,
                   presses his combadge.
