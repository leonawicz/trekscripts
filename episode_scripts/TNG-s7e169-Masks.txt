	FADE IN:

1    INT. CLASSROOM

	TROI and an N.D. TEACHER are supervising an art class.
	SEVERAL N.D. STUDENTS, roughly junior high-school age,
	are making CLAY SCULPTURES. Troi is here as a kind of
	"guest-lecturer", and DATA is here as well, working on
	a sculpture of his own.

	Troi is standing with a twelve year old student, ERIC,
	who's working his clay into a shape vaguely
	recognizable as some kind of animal. Troi inspects his
	work, not exactly sure what it's supposed to be.

					TROI
				(encouraging)
			That's very nice.

	Eric stops working and looks unhappily at his
	sculpture.

					ERIC
				(frustrated)
			No, it isn't. I just can't get it
			right. Do you think the wings are
			too big?

	She now realizes what he's trying to make.

					TROI
			Not at all... birds have wings of
			all sizes, Eric. But you
			shouldn't worry about making it
			look perfect.

	Eric indicates the N.D. Teacher who's working with one
	of the other students in the background.

					ERIC
			But Mrs. Narsu said we should try
			to make our sculptures as
			realistic as possible.

					TROI
			She's right... it is important for
			you to be able to give the clay
			the shape you want it to have.

1    CONTINUED:

					TROI (Cont'd)
			But today you're not supposed to
			concentrate on technique. I'm
			here to help you focus more on the
			feelings you want to convey with
			your sculpture.

	Eric still looks confused. Troi tries to coax it out
	of him.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			For instance... What do you think
			about when you see a bird?

					ERIC
				(hesitant)
			Flying?

					TROI
			Fine. Then try to make your
			sculpture make me think of flying,
			too.

	Eric brightens, understanding, and begins eagerly
	reshaping his clay. Troi smile and moves away...

2    FOLLOW TROI

	as she leaves Eric and walks through the classroom.
	She approaches Data.

					TROI
			How's it going, Data?

					DATA
			I have finished.

	Troi reacts as Data shows her his sculpture: it's a
	flawless CLAY REPLICA OF A PADD. Troi looks at it,
	unsure how to react.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The dimensions are accurate to
			within one-point-three percent.

          STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - TEASER          3.

2    CONTINUED:

					TROI
			I'm sure they are...
				(beat)
			You obviously have no trouble with
			realism, Data, but you're here to
			work on using your imagination.
			Maybe you should try something a
			little more... abstract.

	Troi picks up the clay PADD and puts it aside. She
	continues talking as she gets another raw LUMP OF CLAY
	and sets it down in front of Data.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			I want you to start a new piece...
			I'd like you to sculpt... music.

					DATA
				(puzzled)
			Music?

	Troi nods.

					DATA
			Counselor. Music is a collection
			of acoustic vibrations. How can
			I reproduce a sound with clay?

					TROI
			Think of the effects that sounds
			have on people... the images that
			music brings to your mind... then
			give them a form.

	Data thinks for a beat then pounds the clay flat. In
	a few seconds, he has molded the clay into the form of
	a large MUSICAL NOTE. He shows it expectantly to Troi.

					TROI
				(continuing, looks at
				 the shape)
			It's a start.

	Troi moves away. Data looks curiously at his clay, not
	sure what to do next.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Riker to Data... please report to
			the Bridge.

          STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/14/93 - TEASER          4.

2    CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
				(taps combadge)
			Acknowledged. I am on my way.

	Data EXITS.

									CUT TO:

3    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	is following a mysterious-looking COMET, a smoky chunk
	of icy material with a small GLOWING TAIL of gas coming
	off one side. On the opposite side of the tail, in the
	far background behind the comet, is a star -- a small
	disk at this distance.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47615.2.
			We have encountered a rogue comet
			in sector one-one-five-six. It is
			not native to this region of
			space, and there is no previous
			record of this object on any
			Federation charts.

4    INT. BRIDGE

	PICARD, RIKER, and Data are at their stations; N.D.
	STARFLEET officers man the other positions. Everyone
	is studying the Viewscreen.

					DATA
				(off console)
			Based on its present trajectory,
			the comet appears to have
			originated in the D'Arsay system.

					RIKER
			That's over two sectors from
			here...

					DATA
			That is correct, sir. This object
			has been en route for eighty-seven
			million years.

					RIKER
			That's a long time alone in the
			dark.

          STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/10/93 - TEASER          5.

4    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			Begin a full sensor analysis,
			Mister Data. Log the results for
			the Federation Astrophysical
			Survey.

					DATA
			Aye, sir.

	Data begins to work his console.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The comet's outer shell is
			composed primarily of gaseous
			hydrogen and helium surrounding an
			icy mantle. The inner core
			consists of heavier elements--

	Suddenly, the bridge LIGHTS FLARE, becoming
	significantly brighter for a brief moment. Data cocks
	his head sharply (it's not enough of a movement to be
	suspicious, but in retrospect, we will realize that
	something happened to him at this moment). As the
	lights quickly return to normal, Data recovers and
	returns his attention back to his console.

					PICARD
			What was that?

					DATA
				(off console)
			There is distortion within the
			comet's inner core. I believed we
			experienced an intense sensor
			echo.

					RIKER
			Can you correct for it?

					DATA
			I am attempting to do so now,
			sir...

	A beat as Data works his console...

					DATA
				(continuing)
			I've compensated for the effect.
			Sensors are reconfigured for a low
			intensity sweep.
					(MORE)

          STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - TEASER          6.

4    CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA (Cont'd)
			We are still picking up some
			interference, but the distortion
			is manageable...
				(beat)
			At these settings, the scan will
			be complete in thirty-nine hours.

	Picard nods. OFF his expression.

									CUT TO:

5    INT. TROI'S QUARTERS

	as Troi and BEVERLY ENTER, in mid-conversation.
	Beverly is carrying the 24th century equivalent of a
	GYM BAG.

					BEVERLY
			... Worf said he's going to be
			teaching us some Mok'bara throwing
			techniques today.

	Troi moves directly to her dresser and takes out her
	martial arts gi. She continues speaking as she puts
	the gi into a bag similar to Beverly's.

					TROI
			More like falling techniques...
			the last time we did that I was
			sore for a week...

					BEVERLY (O.S.)
			What's this?

	Beverly is looking at a strange, solid-looking ARTIFACT
	sitting on the table. It is a rectangular column, on
	the top of which sits an oval that is reminiscent of a
	head.

	Troi moves over to join her and stares at the artifact
	for a puzzled beat.

					TROI
			I have no idea.

					BEVERLY
			Maybe Wil left it here... a little
			present?

	Troi picks it up and examines it more closely.

            STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - TEASER            7.

5    CONTINUED:

					TROI
			It's not quite his style...

					BEVERLY
			Then maybe you've got a secret
			admirer.

					TROI
				(smiles)
			That's an interesting thought...

	Beverly takes the artifact out of Troi's hands and puts
	it back on the table.

					BEVERLY
			Well, you can figure it out later.
			We're going to be late.

	Troi nods, and with a last look at the artifact, the
	two women EXIT.

6    CLOSE ON THE ARTIFACT (OPTICAL)

	A short beat after they leave, a strange
	MATERIALIZATION EFFECT occurs: four pairs of lines
	suddenly appear on the "head" -- if there were a face,
	the lines would be running up the forehead, down the
	nose, and across both eyes in a four cardinal direction
	COMPASS DESIGN. OFF the mystery...

7    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	at impulse, following the comet.

8    INT. TEN FORWARD

	Riker, WORF and GEORDI are at a table. Geordi has a
	TRICORDER in front of him, a PADD is next to it. Riker
	idly reaches for a small BOWL of bar-type snacks.

					GEORDI
			We've been getting some pretty
			strange readings from that
			comet... now it looks like
			there's some kind of energy
			generation coming from the core.

					WORF
			Is that unusual?

					GEORDI
			The core is normally just a chunk
			of rock... it should be completely
			inert.

					RIKER
				(shrugs)
			Maybe we've discovered a new kind
			of comet...

	Riker takes a bite of a nut-like object from the bowl --
	reacts with a scowl as he chokes it down.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			They must be changing the snacks
			around here.

	Geordi takes one of what Riker just had from the bowl,
	inspecting it carefully.

					GEORDI
			I don't recognize it.

	The waiter arrives with THREE DIFFERENT DRINKS, setting
	them on the table.

            STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT ONE            9.

8    CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(re: snack)
			Well, whatever you do, don't put
			it in your mouth.

	They each pick up their drinks and with a "cheers" tip
	of the glass, take a sip. Again, Riker scowls.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			This is terrible.

	He sets it down -- it is bluish and viscous. Worf
	picks up Riker's drink and takes a sip.

					WORF
			I like it.

					RIKER
			Then you can have it.. but it's
			not what I ordered.

	Geordi playfully aims his tricorder at the glass.

					GEORDI
				(lightly)
			Let's see what they're trying to
			poison you with...

	His face changes when he sees the readout.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			Wait a minute... this stuff is bio-organic...
			there are oxygenated
			cells... serum electrolytes...
			This looks like some kind of...
			blood.

	Riker reacts.

					RIKER
			You're joking.

					GEORDI
			I'm serious.

					RIKER
			I'm gonna have a little talk with
			the bartender.

	Riker stands.

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE         10.

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					GEORDI
			It might not be his fault. We
			should check out the replicator.

	With a final grimace at the glass, Worf, Riker and
	Geordi leave the table, heading for the bar.

9    INT. CLASSROOM

	The clay-modelling class continues as before --
	including Data working next to Eric. But some of the
	students have moved on to other projects. Eric is
	working in front of a computer which displays a GRAPHIC
	clearly visible as text.

	Troi is walking slowly along, checking the clay-work.

					TROI
			Nice... Very good... I like
			that...

	When she gets to Data she reacts with surprise.

10   INCLUDE DATA'S SCULPTURE

	A MASK -- a kind of cross between Venetian and Mayan.
	The lower face is open to leave the mouth exposed --
	the upper section covers the nose and has holes for
	eyes. The cheekbones sweep down and outward -- like
	wings. The mask is a striking combination of the
	simple and the sophisticated.

					TROI
			Data... This is amazing. How did
			you come up with this?

					DATA
			I followed your advice, Counselor.
			I used my imagination.

	Troi examines the unusual design of the mask.

					TROI
			That's an understatement...

					DATA
			For some reason, as I shaped the
			clay, the image of the mask was
			exceptionally clear in my mind...
			the design seemed to flow quite...
			naturally.

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE         11.

10   CONTINUED:

	Data picks up a SMALL TOOL and begins to scribe another
	design into the clay. It's the distinctive COMPASS
	DESIGN: a small pair of lines running vertically up the
	forehead, another pair down the nose, two others
	horizontally across the eyes -- like cardinal points of
	direction. Exactly like the COMPASS DESIGN on the
	artifact in Troi's quarters.

					TROI
				(recognizing it)
			Data, have you been in my
			quarters?

					DATA
			No, Counselor.

					TROI
			Somebody left an object in my
			room... it was some kind of
			artifact... and it looked similar
			to this.
				(beat)
			You don't know anything about
			that?

					DATA
			I do not.

	Eric is suddenly frustrated at his computer. He moves
	to Troi.

					ERIC
				(re: screen)
			Excuse me, Counselor, could you
			help me with my terminal? It's
			not working right.

11   INCLUDE THE COMPUTER SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	which displays a few dozen, individually distinct,
	alien-looking ideographic symbols -- ICONS -- which
	themselves are arranged in the same paired line,
	COMPASS DESIGN on the mask and artifact.

	Data and Troi react.

					DATA
			Perhaps we should investigate this
			matter further.

	OFF their expressions.

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE         12.

12   INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)

	Geordi and Data are working intently at the consoles.
	Riker is watching over their shoulders. A screen
	displays rows of normal alphanumeric characters -- and
	interspersed are several pockets of the alien ICONS,
	always grouped together in the same COMPASS DESIGN
	arrangement. (NOTE: As Riker and Geordi talk, Data's
	attention will become progressively more focused on the
	screen displaying the alien symbols.)

					RIKER
				(to Geordi)
			These symbols don't match anything
			in Federation linguistic banks.

					GEORDI
			Some kind of alien information has
			been downloaded into our main
			computer. I'm not exactly sure
			how it's working, but it's
			reconfiguring our systems.

					RIKER
			How did it get in?

					GEORDI
			I was able to trace its path from
			the replicators to our sensor
			array.

					RIKER
			The sensors?
				(thinks)
			They've been scanning that comet
			for the last eighteen hours...

	A beat as the implication sinks in.

					GEORDI
				(nods)
			Those energy readings from the
			comet's core... the sensor echo...
				(beat)
			We still don't know what's inside
			that thing.

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE         13.

12   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Maybe it's time we found out.
				(beat)
			Could we use the phasers to melt
			away the outer shell of the comet?

					GEORDI
				(considers)
			A dispersed wide-field beam might
			do the trick... it wouldn't take
			long to come up with the firing
			parameters...
				(to Data)
			What do you think, Data?

	But strangely, Data does not respond immediately --
	he's intently studying the alien symbols on the screen.
	Geordi and Riker exchange a look, and then Geordi moves
	closer to Data.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			What's the matter?

	Data slowly turns to his friend.

					DATA
			I believe I recognize these
			symbols.

					RIKER
			How?

					DATA
			I do not know.

					GEORDI
			Do you think your systems may have
			been affected?

					DATA
			It is a possibility. I do not
			believe my systems are currently
			impaired, but I will run a full
			self-diagnostic to make certain.

					RIKER
				(beat; re: screen)
			What do these symbols mean?

           STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT ONE           14.

12   CONTINUED: (2)

	Data taps a control and one of the compass design
	arrangements is isolated and expanded to fill the
	screen. He points to one of the icons.

					DATA
				(continuing, as if
				 reading)
			"Boundary."

	He continues to point at what he recognizes.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			"Border." "Road." "Companion."
			"Message." "Messenger."

	Data taps the console again, and the compass design is
	replaced by that of a stylized sun image. Data studies
	it.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			"Death."

	OFF their exchanged looks -- what is going on... ?

13   INT. BRIDGE

	Picard, Riker, Data and Worf at their posts. Geordi is
	at the aft science station. Worf works his console,
	glances up.

					WORF
			Captain, phasers are set for wide
			dispersal, ten percent maximum
			power. The beam will terminate
			automatically when the comet's
			core is reached.

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Very well, Mister Worf. Fire...

	Worf works his console, firing the phasers...

14   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship fires a wide phaser beam that hits the comet,
	which starts to vaporize slowly and spectacularly away.
	Hold for several dramatic beats.

           STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT ONE           15.

15   INT. BRIDGE

	The sound of the phasers stops.

					WORF
				(off console)
			Phasers have terminated... the
			outer shell is gone...

16   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as Picard and the others watch the steaming mass on the
	screen finally clear away. In place of the comet is an
	incredible, huge, Mayan-esque, geometric piece of
	technology, vestiges of the frozen gasses of the comet
	still clinging to its alien surface. It is decorated
	with the same type of ICONS that have appeared
	mysteriously on the Enterprise.

	OFF the reactions...

17   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Continuous. Everyone stares at the awe-inspiring
	object on the screen.

					PICARD
			Mister Data... What are we looking
			at? Is it a ship?

	Data is working his console, reading the results.

					DATA
			I do not believe so. The object
			is nearly solid, composed
			primarily of fortanium and several
			unknown materials... It is more
			than eighty-seven million years
			old.

					RIKER
			That's older than the comet
			itself. Could someone in the
			D'Arsay system have built it?

					PICARD
				(considers)
			There are no technologically
			advanced cultures in that system
			now... but perhaps there were
			eighty-seven million years ago.

					RIKER
			But why would anyone hide
			something like that inside a
			comet?

					PICARD
			It's possible the frozen gasses
			simply accumulated over time as it
			travelled through space...

	Geordi breaks in from his position at Aft Science.

					GEORDI
			In any case, it's definitely
			responsible for the system
			anomalies we've been experiencing.
			It's been using our sensor beam as
			a carrier wave to get information
			into our computers and
			replicators.

           STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT TWO           17.

17   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			But the question remains: why?
			What is its purpose?

	A beat as they all ponder the question. Data turns
	away from his console before he speaks.

					DATA
			Captain, I believe this object is
			an informational archive.

					PICARD
			What makes you say that?

	Data seems a little puzzled by his statement himself.

					DATA
			I... do not know, sir. However,
			I seem to have an intuitive
			understanding of its function.

	Everyone reacts -- it's a strange thing for Data to
	say. Geordi moves over to Data's console and looks
	over his shoulder, studying the readouts.

					GEORDI
				(to Picard)
			The internal structure of that
			thing is pretty complex... and
			it's got a repetitive node
			configuration which might suggest
			a database of some kind... but it
			could be practically anything.
				(to Data)
			I don't see how you could know for
			sure what it is.

	Picard looks at Data, concerned.

					PICARD
			Data... do you believe you're in
			communication with that object?

					DATA
			It is a possibility, sir. I
			recommend that we perform a level
			one diagnostic of my positronic
			net immediately to determine if
			that is the case.

					PICARD
			Very well... Mister LaForge, give
			him a hand.

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/10/93 - ACT TWO         18.

17   CONTINUED: (2)

	Geordi and Data acknowledge and move away, EXITING the
	Bridge. An N.D. Starfleet Officer takes over Data's
	position at Ops. Picard and Riker continue to study
	the alien object.

					RIKER
				(to Picard)
			Do you think it's just trying to
			make contact with us?

					PICARD
				(thoughtful)
			Perhaps. And if this really is an
			archive from some ancient
			civilization, we should allow it
			to do so. But we must be
			careful...
				(beat)
			Mister Worf, keep an eye on the
			sensors. If the Archive poses any
			danger to the ship, I want you to
			sever the connection immediately.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

	OFF Picard's fascinated expression.

18   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship following the ancient object.

19   INT. READY ROOM

	The room is now dotted with ARTIFACTS -- on the
	shelves, on the desk, on the floor -- collected from
	all over the ship. They all share the same vaguely
	Mayan look we've seen before.

	Picard is standing in the middle of the room, examining
	the artifact from Troi's room. The cylinder has the
	now-familiar COMPASS DESIGN carved on its surface.
	Picard studies it carefully, jotting an occasional note
	on a PADD -- if not for the surroundings, he might be
	an archaeologist on a dig.

	The door CHIMES.

					PICARD
			Come.

	Riker ENTERS -- and stops short, reacting to the sight.

           STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT TWO           19.

19   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Captain...

	Picard motions Riker in but doesn't stop working.

					PICARD
			Come in, Number One...

	Riker moves closer.

					RIKER
			We've confined the system
			corruption. It's not spreading
			any further, but we've still got
			alien symbols floating around
			inside our computer...

	Picard merely nods and jots another note onto his PADD
	and moves to study another object.

					RIKER
			This is quite a collection you've
			assembled...

	Riker picks up an object and looks it over...

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			I've seen these things all over
			the ship. They all look the
			same... primitive and non-functional.

					PICARD
				(correcting him)
			Ceremonial... and deceptively
			primitive. Only an advanced
			technological culture could have
			built that object out there.
			These artifacts must have played
			a ritualistic role in their
			society.

					RIKER
			Do you think Data's right? Have
			we stumbled across some kind of
			alien library?

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT TWO         20.

19   CONTINUED: (2)

	Picard clearly likes the notion.

					PICARD
			It's possible... and if so, this
			could be a find of enormous
			significance. This "library"
			seems designed to do far more than
			simply store information. Who
			knows how much we could learn from
			it?

	Riker smiles at Picard's obvious excitement. He
	glances at the COMPASS DESIGN carved on the stone
	cylinder seen earlier.

					RIKER
			I keep seeing this design...

					PICARD
				(nods)
			It seems to be a symbol of some
			significance.

					RIKER
			What do you think it means?

					PICARD
				(offers)
			The concept of the four cardinal
			compass directions is common to
			many different cultures...

					RIKER
			The words Data recognized on the
			computer -- "boundary," "border,"
			"road" -- they were also arranged
			in that design.

					PICARD
			Perhaps everything with the
			compass design is part of the same
			theme -- movement. Finding a
			direction, travelling a path,
			crossing a boundary--

					RIKER
			And "death." One of the symbols
			was "death."

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT TWO         21.

19   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			The ultimate boundary.

	Picard turns and picks up a small STONE NECKLACE with
	a stylized SUN-DESIGN PENDANT (similar to the symbol
	seen in Act 1.) He turns it over.

20   INSERT - THE PENDANT

	On the back is a small symbol -- off to one side, as if
	not wanting to be the center of attention. It is the
	symbol of what we will come to know as the moon.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			I keep seeing this symbol, too....
			but it's never prominently
			displayed...

21   BACK TO SCENE

					PICARD
			Always in the background...
			smaller than the others...

					RIKER
			Do you know what it represents?

					PICARD
			I have no idea.

	OFF their expressions as they share the mystery.

									CUT TO:

22   INT. ENGINEERING

	Data is sitting calmly; a section of his head is open.

					GEORDI
			Lower synaptic functions are
			completely normal... Autonomous
			systems all check out...

					DATA
			I suggest we examine the memory
			sub-systems next.

					GEORDI
			All right...

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT TWO         22.

22   CONTINUED:

	As Geordi begins to work a panel, Data suddenly makes
	an abrupt head tilt. He looks puzzled.

					GEORDI
				(noticing)
			Data... what's the matter?

					DATA
			I am... not certain. I am
			experiencing a curious
			sensation...

					GEORDI
			What is it?

					DATA
			An... impulse.

	Geordi reacts.

					GEORDI
			Impulse? What kind of impulse?

					DATA
			I do not know.

					GEORDI
			I'm checking your higher
			functions.

	A beat. Data's voice is a little uneven.

					DATA
			Geordi... What does it feel like
			when a person... loses his mind?

					GEORDI
			Data, you're scaring me. What's
			the matter?

					DATA
			I... do not... know...

					GEORDI
			You're gonna be all right. You're
			with me, okay?

	Data glances up at his friend.

					DATA
			Okay.

	Geordi turns back to the console -- sees a violent
	change in the reading.

         STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/10/93 - ACT TWO         23.

22   CONTINUED: (2)

					GEORDI
			What's going on... ?

	He quickly rushes to Data, and sees that inside Data's
	head is a web of alien circuitry, similar to the
	artifacts we've already seen, as if the positronic
	brain itself has been transformed.

					GEORDI
				(stunned)
			Data...

	Data suddenly turns toward Geordi -- the compass design
	he scribed on the mask is now on his own face, in
	raised, tiny scars. A ceremonial NECKPLATE with a
	distinctive design has also appeared around Data's
	neck.

	Data looks at Geordi and smiles, his voice animated and
	playful.

					DATA/IHAT
			Masaka is waking.

	Geordi reacts with a horrified look. OFF Data's
	smile...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

23   INT. ENGINEERING

	Data, his head plate now back in place, is moving
	around the room in an energetic, very non-Data fashion,
	curiously inspecting his surroundings as though he's
	never seen this place before. Geordi watches him,
	concerned.

	Picard ENTERS with TWO N.D. STARFLEET Security Guards.
	As the guards fan out cautiously, watching Data, Geordi
	turns to Picard.

					GEORDI
			Captain, he just--

					DATA/IHAT
				(interrupting)
			I waited for you, Captain. You
			should feel honored... I don't
			usually wait for anybody.

	Picard reacts to Data's loose manner.

					PICARD
				(cautiously)
			What is it you want?

					DATA/IHAT
			Masaka is waking.

					PICARD
			Are you Masaka?

	Data/Ihat rolls his eyes and turns to Geordi.

					DATA/IHAT
			What were my exact words?

					GEORDI
			You said, "Masaka is waking."

					DATA/IHAT
			And isn't that what I've been
			saying since we first met?

	Geordi nods. Satisfied, Data/Ihat turns back to
	Picard.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE        25.

23   CONTINUED:

					DATA/IHAT
			I'm not "Masaka", Captain...
				(proudly)
			I am Ihat.

					PICARD
			What have you done to Commander
			Data?

					DATA/IHAT
			Commander Data... ?

	Data/Ihat seems to be momentarily at a loss, apparently
	not understanding what Picard is referring to; but
	then, he brightens, and indicates his own body.

					DATA/IHAT
				(continuing)
			You mean the one who was here?

	Picard reacts to the phrasing.

					PICARD
			Yes.

					DATA/IHAT
			He's gone. And who can say where?

	Picard has seen enough to know that he's going to need
	some help here. He discreetly taps his combadge.

					PICARD
				(to com)
			Counselor Troi, report to
			Engineering immediately.

	Ihat is again moving around the room, taking in his
	surroundings. While he waits for Troi, Picard is
	trying to get as much information out of him as he can.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Ihat. The place you came from...
			Is it a cultural archive of your
			species?

	Data/Ihat doesn't seem to understand the question.

					DATA/IHAT
				(simply)
			I come from Masaka's city.

	Picard reacts.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE        26.

23   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Are there others like you there?

					DATA/IHAT
				(laughs)
			There are no others like me.

					PICARD
			Who is Masaka?

	There is a trace of wariness and fear when he responds.

					DATA/IHAT
			You will find out...

	Picard and Geordi react. Data/Ihat indicates the room.

					DATA/IHAT
				(continuing)
			I don't think Masaka will like
			this place... at least not the way
			it is now...

					PICARD
				(pressing)
			I would like to know more about
			this Masaka... perhaps we can
			speak --

	Data/Ihat whirls on Picard, intense.

					DATA/IHAT
			Do you understand pain? Death?
			That is all you need to know about
			Masaka... that is what she is.

	Data/Ihat looks around furtively, as if someone were
	after him.

					DATA/IHAT
			You must go... leave this place
			before she finds you. It can be
			done... I did it...

	At that moment, Troi ENTERS.

					TROI
			What's going on, sir?

	Data/Ihat whirls at the sound of her voice, surprised.
	When he sees Troi, all trace of swagger vanishes,
	replaced instantly and completely with fear.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/15/93 - ACT THREE        27.

23   CONTINUED: (3)

					DATA/IHAT
			Masaka... ?

	He barely manages to gasp out the one, terror-filled
	word before he jerks violently and falls to his knees
	with a strangled cry.

					GEORDI
			Data!

	Geordi rushes over to help his friend to his feet, but
	when Data looks up, he has changed again: he's wearing
	a NEW NECKPLATE with a different distinctive design
	than before.

	Data stares at Troi with wild eyes and a blissful,
	toothy grin. He speaks with a fanatical, zealous
	fervor.

					DATA/VICTIM
			Masaka! I am yours! Every part
			of me is yours!

					PICARD
				(gravely, to N.D.
				 Security)
			Get him to Sickbay.

	As Geordi and the N.D. Security Guards move to take
	Data away, Picard and Troi exchange a concerned look...

									CUT TO:

24   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	as before, travelling with the ancient archive.

25   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	Picard, Riker, Beverly, Troi, and Geordi.

					BEVERLY
			Every time he saw Deanna, he'd
			fall to his knees screaming "Take
			me, Masaka -- take me."

					TROI
			Data was acting as if he were a
			sacrificial victim of some kind...

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE        28.

25   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			And apparently one all too willing
			to go to his death.

					BEVERLY
			I put him in isolation in his
			quarters. He's under guard... he
			seems to have calmed down a
			little.

					RIKER
			Couldn't we just shut him down and
			purge his memory systems?

	Geordi shakes his head grimly.

					GEORDI
			I don't think it's going to be
			that simple...

	Geordi gets up, moves to the monitor, where there is a
	GRAPHIC of a complex web of interconnections, but the
	connections have been radically reorganized into
	several centers -- nodal points with complex webs
	radiating from each. The structure suggests the
	vaguely Mayan alien designs we've seen before.

					GEORDI
			This is a micrograph of what's
			happened to Data's positronic net.
			As near as I can tell, these are
			behavioral nodes... I've found
			fourteen of them so far.
				(beat)
			I think the Archive is using Data
			to create different "people" from
			its culture... in the same way it
			used our replicators to create
			artifacts.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/14/93 - ACT THREE        29.

25   CONTINUED: (2)

					TROI
			As a result, his real personality
			has been completely buried. In a
			sense, Data has the android
			equivalent of multiple
			personalities.

					GEORDI
			And the Archive hasn't stopped
			yet... Data's positronic net is
			still being transformed. There's
			no way to tell how many more
			personalities might emerge...

	There's a stunned beat as everyone takes in the
	information.

					RIKER
			Our sensors are still in contact
			with the Archive. Would there be
			a risk to Data if we severed that
			connection?

					GEORDI
			I don't know... but I wouldn't
			want to take the chance. Right
			now, our only link to the Archive
			is that sensor beam. If there's
			a way to reverse what's happened
			to Data, I think we're going to
			need that link to do it.

	Picard takes a beat to consider his limited options.

					PICARD
			Mister La Forge, continue to scan
			the Archive. Try to find some way
			to access it. In the meantime,
			I'll see what I can learn from
			these "people" inside Data.

	OFF Picard's grim expression.

26   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS

	The DOOR OPENS and Picard ENTERS. Two Security Guards
	can be seen standing outside. Data is on the floor,
	curled up tightly in a corner of the room (he is still
	in his "Victim" personality). As Picard approaches
	him, he recoils.

       STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/14/93 - ACT THREE       29A.

26   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(gently)
			It's all right... I'm not going to
			hurt you...

					DATA/VICTIM
			Only Masaka can hurt me... I am
			for her alone...

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I need to speak to Ihat. Do you
			understand me? Ihat...

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE        30.

26   CONTINUED:

	For a moment, Data/Victim returns nothing but a fearful
	stare, uncomprehending and empty. But then, Data jerks
	suddenly -- when he turns back to Picard, he has
	changed into his Ihat personality.

					DATA/IHAT
			Captain...

	Picard is almost glad to see him. Data/Ihat goes into
	his customary high-energy mode and starts pacing around
	the room.

					DATA/IHAT
				(continuing)
			That was a cruel joke to play on
			me. For a moment -- a brief
			moment -- I actually thought that
			woman was Masaka.

					PICARD
			Whoever took your place wasn't
			afraid of Masaka -- he almost
			seemed eager for his fate.

					DATA/IHAT
			Pitiful, isn't it?
				(mock Victim voice)
			"Take me! Take me!" Ha. You
			wouldn't catch me humiliating
			myself for a woman -- even if she
			were a queen.

					PICARD
			Then Masaka is your queen... ?

					DATA/IHAT
			She's a lazy creature... she
			spends most of her time
			sleeping...
				(beat)
			The problem is what she does when
			she's awake.

	Picard has no choice but to play along.

					PICARD
			Then should we try to keep her
			asleep?

					DATA/IHAT
				(laughs)
			Try to keep the sun from climbing
			the sky? Only Korgano can do
			that. And he's not here.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE        31.

26   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Where is he?

	Suddenly, Data/Ihat collapses onto the floor, pulling
	himself inward, knees huddled together, head down, arms
	tight.

					DATA/BOY
			Help me... please...

	Picard steps over and Data looks up. The Ihat
	neckplate is gone. In its place is ANOTHER NECKPLATE
	with yet another distinctive design -- Data has now
	assumed the personality of a frightened Boy.

					PICARD
			What's wrong?

					DATA/BOY
			I'm afraid.

					PICARD
			Of what?

					DATA/BOY
			Of her.

					PICARD
			Masaka?

					DATA/BOY
			Her.

	Suddenly, the SHIP TREMBLES. Lights go out; emergency
	lighting comes on.

					PICARD
				(taps combadge)
			Picard to Bridge! Report!

27   INT. BRIDGE

	Lots of activity. Riker is on his feet, Geordi is at
	Aft Science. Worf is heading quickly toward the
	Turbolift.

					RIKER
				(to com)
			The Archive just activated some
			kind of tractor beam, sir. We

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			It's overriding our control

					PICARD
				(to com)
			I'll be right there...

	Picard starts to move away but stops short -- Data/Boy
	has a vice-like grip on Picard's wrist.

					DATA/BOY
			Don't leave me.

	Data's hand slowly grips tighter with his android
	strength. Picard stifles a cry of pain.

					PICARD
			I... I... won't... leave you...
				(beat)
			Please... let go...

					DATA/BOY
			Does it hurt?

					PICARD
				(barely)
			Yes...

					DATA/BOY
			She's going to hurt us all...

	Data stares at him for a moment longer and then
	abruptly releases his grip. As Picard grabs his wrist
	in pain, Data jerks and stares up at Picard -- he has
	changed again and is now back in his Ihat personality.
	He smiles ruefully at Picard.

					DATA/IHAT
			Now you've done it. Masaka is
			awake.

	OFF Picard's reaction...

29   INT. CORRIDOR

	Worf and Two Security Guards are hurrying up a
	corridor. They arrive at Ten-Forward and step quickly
	through the entrance.

30   INT. TEN-FORWARD - CONTINUOUS

	Worf and his officers are shocked at what they find.
	The room has been transformed. Tropical foliage is
	everywhere, green vines and huge, red, fern-like
	fronds. Half the tables are gone -- stone slabs take
	their place. The patrons are standing around in
	stunned silence.

	The bar has been partially transformed into rough
	stone; a stone column stands near it, and inscribed
	prominently on it is a LARGE FEMALE FACE IN THE RADIANT
	SHAPE OF A SUN.

	OFF their stunned expressions...

31   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	A powerful beam is being continuously projected from

32   INT. TEN FORWARD

	Like the rest of the ship, the room is dark and lit
	only by emergency lights. All non-essential personnel
	have been cleared, and Geordi and Worf are using
	tricorders to scan the vegetation and stone slabs.

	Picard circles around the sun image, studying it,
	trying to fit things together as Troi watches nearby.

					TROI
				(re: sun image)
			Who is this?

					PICARD
			I'd say it's Masaka. Ihat
			referred to her as a queen... it's
			not unusual in ceremonial cultures
			for royalty to be symbolized by a
			sun.

					TROI
			You said the personalities inside
			Data were in awe of her... even
			terrified.

					PICARD
				(nods)
			According to Data, the sun image
			is also the symbol for death.

	They move to the back of the column, where Picard
	notices something.

					PICARD
			There it is again... this U-shaped
			symbol... small and
			insignificant... almost like an
			afterthought...

	But before Troi can respond, Geordi and Worf approach.

					GEORDI
			I'm not sure. But bit by bit, the
			ship's being transformed.

					WORF
			We have received reports from the
			rest of the ship. Part of deck
			twelve is now an aqueduct.

					TROI
			What are we being transformed
			into?

					GEORDI
			I'm not sure I want to find out.

	Picard takes in the information. It's a difficult
	decision for him to make, but there's no alternative.

					PICARD
			I don't think we have a choice...
			we'll have to destroy the Archive.
			Mister Worf?

					WORF
			Sir, our weapon control systems
			are inoperative. However, we
			could configure a photon torpedo
			for manual launch...

					PICARD
			Make it so.

	Geordi and Worf turn and EXIT. Picard and Troi look
	around the strangely transformed room.

					PICARD
			There's so much here we could have
			learned... I regret losing that
			opportunity.

	Troi acknowledges his ambivalence.

									CUT TO:

33   INT. ENGINEERING

	Emergency lighting only. A PHOTON TORPEDO lies on a
	cradle between the pool table and the warp core. A
	control panel on the torpedo casing flickers with
	several lights. Geordi works at the pool table console
	as Worf scans the torpedo.

					GEORDI
			Okay... I've locked in the
			targeting parameters... what's the
			phase alignment now?

					WORF
			Less than point seven percent.

					GEORDI
			That'll do it. I'm setting the
			yield at maximum...

	But at Geordi works, the control panel lights on the
	torpedo go dead.

					WORF
				(puzzled)
			Sir... the onboard power systems
			are not functioning...

	Geordi crosses to the torpedo, tries to activate it
	manually, but it doesn't work.

					GEORDI
			What's going on here... ?

	Geordi opens up the casing and both men look inside...

34   INSIDE THE TORPEDO

	It is full of writhing snakes.

35   RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)

	Worf and Geordi react and jump back -- then they turn
	around and see the awesome IMAGE OF MASAKA which now
	fills the entire back panel of Engineering. A few
	vines are hanging on the walls.

					GEORDI
			Something tells me we'd better get
			out of here...

           STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR           37.

35   CONTINUED:

	They quickly move toward the exit -- only to be driven
	back by a roaring WALL OF FLAMES that shoots up in
	front of the them... The room around them has become a
	nightmarish, hell-like place.

					WORF
				(taps combadge)
			Engineering to Bridge -- emergency
			transport! Two to beam out...

	Geordi and Worf DEMATERIALIZE.

									CUT TO:

36   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship still held by the beams from the Archive.

37   INT. BRIDGE

	The Bridge is dark, lit only by the emergency lights.
	The walls are hung with strange, ominous vines.

	Picard and Troi are near the Aft Science station,
	heading for the Observation Lounge when those DOORS
	OPEN and Riker comes out onto the Bridge. He's a
	little shaken from seeing something in that room.

					RIKER
			Maybe we'd better talk in here.
			The Observation Lounge seems to
			have become a swamp.

	Nobody argues with him. They gather around the command
	area, where Worf, Beverly, and Geordi join them.

					PICARD
				(to Geordi)
			What's our status?

					GEORDI
			So far the Archive's transformed
			over twenty percent of the ship...
			and we've lost main propulsion and
			weapons systems in the process.

					RIKER
			What about communications?
			Sensors? Life support?

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/14/93 - ACT FOUR        38.

37   CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
			We have communications, and
			limited sensor control. Life
			support seems unaffected.

					BEVERLY
			I've been analyzing samples of
			these alien plant forms. They've
			been formed from biological matter
			we have on the ship...

					GEORDI
			The stone, the artifacts...
			they're made the same way --
			extrapolated from the ship's own
			alloys.

					BEVERLY
			Apparently the Archive can reorder
			and transform molecular structures --
			including DNA -- to make whatever
			it wants.

					PICARD
			So it's using our ship -- our
			alloys, our DNA, -- to create
			elements of its own culture...

37   CONTINUED: (2)

					TROI
			But why is all this happening?
			What is the Archive trying to
			accomplish?

					WORF
			It could be a weapon.

	They all look at him.

					WORF
			It is powerful and insidious. It
			has completely disarmed us.

					RIKER
			Maybe it's more benign than that.
			If a civilization were dying...
			they might have created this
			technology to preserve their
			culture, and re-create it at some
			later point...

	Picard paces, trying to fit the pieces together.

					PICARD
			It could even be a sophisticated
			terraforming device.

	The others look at him quizzically.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR        40.

37   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			The Archive creates an
			environment... all the elements
			which enable a culture to exist...

	They realize there are many possibilities -- and that
	they may never know the real reason behind this
	technology.

					PICARD
			But whatever the intent behind the
			process, I don't want this ship
			transformed into an alien city.
			Mister La Forge, do you have any
			ideas?

					GEORDI
			We still haven't been able to cut
			off that beam... but I've managed
			to access the Archive by sending
			an energy pulse back along their
			signal path. If I can locate the
			transformation program, I might be
			able to get control of it.

					PICARD
			Good, keep at it...

	Picard turns to gaze at the Viewscreen.

38   ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as Masaka's mask looms over them.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			But somehow... I believe the
			answer lies there...

39   RESUME SCENE

					PICARD
			... with Masaka. We need to find
			her... access her... talk to her.

	The others acknowledge -- this must be done.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FOUR        41.

40   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS

	Even darker than the Bridge. The door opens and Picard
	steps inside. A small fire is burning on the other
	side of the cabin -- on the now dirt-covered floor.
	Data is crouched down besides it, warming his hands.

	As Picard approaches, he sees that Data is wearing a
	NEW NECKPLATE, one he hasn't seen before.

					PICARD
				(cautious)
			Hello...

	Data's voice is old and tired, and he moves slowly and
	with difficulty like an old man.

					DATA/ELDER
			It's difficult... to stay warm...

	Picard sits down next to him.

					PICARD
			The fire feels good...

	Data/Elder looks at him quizzically.

					DATA/ELDER
			But it's not warm enough. Not for
			an old man.

					PICARD
			Tell me... about Masaka.

					DATA/ELDER
			My daughter?

	Picard reacts, amazed.

					PICARD
			Yes... how can I talk to her?

	Data/Elder laughs -- a dry, cackling rasp.

					DATA/ELDER
			Talk -- to Masaka?

					PICARD
			Yes. It's important. Can you
			tell her I must speak with her?

					DATA/ELDER
			Children grow... forget their
			parents... no, only Korgano can
			talk to Masaka.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/14/93 - ACT FOUR        42.

40   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Korgano... who is that?

	Data/Elder seems to lose interest... stares back into
	the fire.

					DATA/ELDER
			So cold... can't stay warm...

	Suddenly, Data/Elder seems to crumple into a limp
	heap... and then he jumps up, vital and hyper (NOTE: he
	is now wearing his Ihat neckplate).

					DATA/IHAT
			Well, you're a persistent one,
			aren't you?

					PICARD
			Ihat?

					DATA/IHAT
			Is anyone else so charming?

					PICARD
			Masaka is taking over my ship.

					DATA/IHAT
			I told you she would.

					PICARD
			I want to talk with her... but I'm
			told only Korgano can do that.

	Data/Ihat is wary, alert.

					DATA/IHAT
			Who told you that?

					PICARD
			An old man... Masaka's father...

					DATA/IHAT
			Ah, yes... legends say she chopped
			him up and used his bones to make
			the world.
				(beat)
			Any wonder he doesn't like to talk
			about her?

					PICARD
			How can I find Korgano?

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR        43.

40   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA/IHAT
			I don't know. He's not chasing
			her anymore.

					PICARD
			Where has he gone?

	Data/Ihat paces, agitated, uncomfortable with all this.

					DATA/IHAT
			Stop asking these questions. I
			was fast enough to avoid her
			once... I don't want her to find
			me again. I'll end up on her
			sacrificial slab.

					PICARD
			If Masaka is looking for a
			sacrifice... she can take me
			instead.
				(beat)
			Perhaps then she'd stop looking
			for you.

					DATA/IHAT
				(a chuckle)
			Well, there's an idea. Better you
			than me.

					PICARD
			All right. Tell me what to do...

	There is a hesitation, as though Ihat is coming to a
	decision. Then --

					DATA/IHAT
			You must build Masaka's temple...
			the Queen's temple. That will get
			her attention.

					PICARD
			Very well. How do I do that?

					DATA/IHAT
			You need the sign.
				(beat, coy)
			I could give it to you... so could
			the Old Man. But just try getting
			it out of him.

					PICARD
			Give me the sign.

        STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR        44.

40   CONTINUED: (3)

	Data/Ihat in an agony of indecision.

					DATA/IHAT
			If she finds out...
				(beat)
			You can't imagine her rage... she
			lets people die of thirst... a
			terrible death. Sometimes she
			burns them alive...
				(beat, in awe)
			She is glorious.

	But Picard is impatient with all this.

					PICARD
			Ihat... the sign. What is it?

	Data/Ihat looks around him, as though ascertaining that
	no one else is around.

					DATA/IHAT
			If she comes... you'll take my
			place?

					PICARD
			Yes.

					DATA/IHAT
			All right. Quickly. Give me your
			hand.

	Picard holds out his hand. Data/Ihat takes it, turns
	it face up, and starts "drawing" a line with one finger
	across Picard's palm.

					DATA/IHAT
				(continuing)
			A line, as the unending horizon...
				(beat)
			A curve as --

	Suddenly Data freezes. A look of terror crosses his
	face.

					DATA/IHAT
				(continuing)
			She has found me.

	Picard looks for another change in Data.

					PICARD
			Masaka, show yourself. I'll go
			with you...

40   CONTINUED: (4)

	But Data/Ihat sinks to his knees.

					DATA/IHAT
				(continuing)
			It seems... I was not fast
			enough...

	His head droops. Picard crouches down beside him.
	Then Data looks up -- he's wearing the Elder's
	neckplate. Data crumples into a seated position near
	the fire, stretches his hands toward it.

					DATA/ELDER
			So hard to stay warm...

	Picard needs to find a way to reach this man. He moves
	closer to him and helps him build up the fire.

					PICARD
			Let me help you...

	Data/Elder glances at him.

					DATA/ELDER
			Are you one of my children?
				(turns to fire)
			I don't remember anymore.

					PICARD
			I need your help. I need the sign
			for the temple.
				(beat)
			Masaka's temple.

					DATA/ELDER
			It won't help you. Korgano no
			longer pursues her. No one else
			can stop her.

	Picard cautiously reaches out and takes Data's hand,
	guiding it to the floor, using Data's fingers to draw
	a line in the dirt, repeating Ihat's words from memory.

					PICARD
			A line... as the unending
			horizon...
				(beat)
			A curve...

	Picard doesn't know any more. The old man doesn't
	resist, but isn't responding either. Picard tries
	again, tracing the pattern and repeating the words.

			A line... as the unending horizon.

            PICARD                 DATA/ELDER
          A curve...         A curve...

					DATA/ELDER
			... as a rolling hillside.

	Data finishes the curve and makes a dot above it.

					DATA/ELDER
				(continuing)
			A point... as a distant bird.

	And another line drawn vertical to the horizon.

					DATA/ELDER
				(continuing)
			A ray... as the rising sun.

	He stops, finished. The symbol is complete.

					PICARD
			Thank you.

					DATA/ELDER
			Now sit with me... tend the
			fire...

	Data suddenly slumps over. He is completely still for
	a beat, then he looks up, wearing the neckplate of the
	Frightened Boy.

					DATA/BOY
			I'm alone... there's no one left
			to help me... she's coming.

	Picard pulls him upright.

					PICARD
			Are the others dead? Did Masaka
			kill them?

					DATA/BOY
			No. She sent them away. It will
			take them days to die.

	Data suddenly freezes. His mouth opens in a circle and
	holds perfectly still. And out of the open mouth comes
	an eerie wail -- a child's scream plunging into a
	bottomless nightmare.

               STAR TREK: "Masks" 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR               47.

40   CONTINUED: (6)

	The voice finally disappears. Data slumps over.
	Picard pulls back his head: the neckplate is gone and
	there are NO SCARS on his forehead. Data stares into
	space, his eyes wide, as if there were nothing behind
	them.

	OFF Picard's reaction...

	into simple STONE PEDESTALS.

43   ANGLE ON AFT SCIENCE

	Picard, Riker, and Troi are gathered around Geordi.
	The screen displays a GRAPHIC of the TEMPLE SYMBOL
	drawn by the Elder.

					GEORDI
			I think I've found the Archive's
			transformation program.

					PICARD
			Will it accept the symbol for
			Masaka's temple?

					GEORDI
			I think so. I've isolated the
			program's input pathways. They're
			keyed to accept symbols...

	He gestures toward the display.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			If I input this one, it should
			initiate the transformation
			process...

					RIKER
			And create the temple?

43   CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
			I hope so... if this is the wrong
			symbol, it might turn the
			Enterprise into a big chunk of
			rock. There's no way to be sure.

	It's a tough choice.

					TROI
			The question is... can we trust a
			personality from an alien Archive
			that seems bent on taking us over?

					PICARD
				(considers)
			Ihat risked his life to show me

	For a moment, nothing seems to happen. Picard, Troi,
	and Worf exchange puzzled looks, and then suddenly, the
	walls dissolve into...

47   INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

	It's a huge, cavernous room that seems to have been
	carved out of a rockface. Stone slabs and columns are
	placed here and there, some adorned with engraved
	figures and symbols. Sitting on a raised platform is
	a GOLDEN THRONE in the shape of a solar disc. The
	group turns around, looking at the trappings, taking
	everything in.

					PICARD
				(re: throne)
			This would seem to be Masaka's
			temple...

	Worf looks warily around the room.

					WORF
			There's no one else here.

					PICARD
			Ihat said creating the temple
			would get her attention... it may
			take time before she shows
			herself.

					WORF
			And how will she do that?

			I don't know.

	Troi has been off to one side, looking at the columns.

					TROI
			Captain... look at this.

	They join her and she gestures to --

48   A STONE COLUMN

	In the face of the column is carved two different
	images: Masaka's sun symbol is shown large and
	prominent in the foreground; but smaller, and to one
	side, as if receding into the distance, the small
	"horns" symbol Picard has seen before is also evident.

49   RESUME SCENE

	as Picard looks closely at the symbols.

					PICARD
			This is the first time I've seen
			these two symbols paired... That
			could be significant...

	He glances around, sees other instances of the two
	symbols together.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			There it is again... and again.
			Clearly this is an important
			pairing...

	He stops, remembering something.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			"He's not chasing her anymore... "

	They look at him quizzically.

					TROI
			Sir?

					PICARD
			Ihat said that someone named
			Korgano was not chasing Masaka
			anymore. And the old man said,
			"he pursues her no longer... "

	He gestures to the horn symbol.

49   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			In a sense, this smaller symbol is
			chasing Masaka. Perhaps it
			represents Korgano.

					WORF
			The symbol suggests antlers of
			some kind... horns. Maybe it's
			meant to represent an animal...

					TROI
			Animal gods are worshipped in many
			cultures...

					PICARD
			Both Ihat and the old man said
			that Korgano was the only one who
			could control Masaka...
				(beat, thinking)
			Many ritualistic cultures
			incorporate the idea of "balance"
			into their belief systems. Masaka
			is a queen, a powerful, god-like
			figure... it's not unreasonable to
			assume that she might have a
			counterpart... or a consort...

	Picard begins to look around the room.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Spread out... see if you can find
			that horn-like symbol anywhere
			else.

	And they begin to move around the room.

									CUT TO:

54   INT. TEMPLE

	Picard, Troi, and Worf are clustered in front of
	another STONE COLUMN, studying another glyph showing
	Masaka's sun image and the horn symbol. However, this

	Masaka's sun is small and receding.

					TROI
			This is the most prominent
			instance of the horn symbol we've
			seen yet...

					WORF
			But now it appears as though
			Masaka's sun is chasing it.

	Troi is thinking aloud, trying to piece it together.

					TROI
			An animal chasing the sun... ?

					PICARD
			Maybe it's simpler than that.
				(beat)
			Maybe the relationship between
			them is more like the sun and the
			moon.

					WORF
			I see... Masaka and Korgano
			changing positions... the sun
			setting and the moon rising.

	A beat as they consider the notion.

					TROI
			And like the sun and the moon,
			only one of them can be in
			ascendance at any given time...

					PICARD
			If we could find Korgano within

			perhaps he could force Masaka to
			leave.

					WORF
			But would we be any better off
			with him?

					PICARD
				(considers)
			Ihat and the others didn't seem to
			be afraid of Korgano...

	Suddenly, the SHIP TREMBLES. The group whirls to see
	Data/Masaka as she ENTERS the temple and moves
	majestically toward the throne.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Masaka...

	Data/Masaka sits down upon the throne and silently
	looks out at her temple. Picard, Troi, and Worf
	cautiously approach the throne.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Masaka, I am Jean-Luc Picard of

	GRAPHIC: it's Korgano's moon symbol.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			This is the only place in the
			Archive where Korgano's moon
			symbol is by itself and not paired
			with Masaka's.

	Picard stares at the image for a moment, pondering.

					PICARD
			Mister La Forge, access the
			transformation program.

	Geordi begins working controls.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			When you're ready, input the
			symbol.

             STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/15/93 - ACT FIVE            56.

55   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Isn't that a little risky?

					TROI
			We have no way of knowing what the
			result would be. The symbol might
			generate anything from Korgano's
			temple... to Korgano himself.

					PICARD
			In some sense, Korgano is Masaka's
			nemesis. Whatever this symbol
			represents -- it might give us a
			way to control her.
				(beat)
			If you have a better idea, I'd be
			glad to entertain it.

	A brief silence.

					GEORDI
			I've accessed the program, sir.

	Picard looks to the others, takes a breath...

					PICARD
			Initiate the transformation.

	Geordi hits a command on his console. There's a tense
	moment; no one's sure what's going to happen and
	they're ready for anything. Then a simple, SILVER MASK
	APPEARS -- on its forehead is Korgano's moon symbol.

					RIKER
			Another mask...

	Picard picks up the mask and looks at it thoughtfully.

					PICARD
			Perhaps we've been approaching
			this incorrectly. We're dealing
			with a highly ritualistic
			culture... a society based on
			symbol and myth. Maybe we need to
			confront them on those terms
			instead...
				(beat)
			If I can incorporate myself into
			their rituals, perhaps Masaka will
			listen to me.

             STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/15/93 - ACT FIVE           56A.

55   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
				(catching on)
			You're going to pose as Korgano.

	Picard nods and holds the mask up to his face, testing
	the fit.

					TROI
			Captain, we know so little about
			this culture... and even less
			about Korgano himself. How will
			you convince Masaka that you're
			him?

					PICARD
			I'm not entirely sure. But there
			are similarities between this
			culture and others I've studied.
				(beat)
			I suppose I'll just have to
			improvise.

	There's a grim beat -- but they all know that there's
	really no other choice.

					PICARD
			Mister Worf, what's our status?

					WORF
				(off console)
			I estimate we have less than two
			hours before there's nothing left
			of the ship... at least nothing
			that we recognize.

	Picard nods grimly and heads for the Turbolift. He
	holds the mask in his hands as he EXITS.

									CUT TO:

56   INT. TEMPLE (OPTICAL)

	Data/Masaka is sitting on the throne.

					PICARD (O.S.)
			Masaka!

             STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/13/93 - ACT FIVE            57.

56   CONTINUED:

	Data/Masaka reacts as Picard approaches -- he is
	wearing the Korgano mask. For the first time, we see
	a real reaction from Data/Masaka -- she's shocked at
	the sight.

					DATA/MASAKA
			Korgano... ?

	Picard takes a step closer -- he's playing it by ear,
	choosing his words carefully, taking it one step at a
	time...

					PICARD
			Are you surprised to see me?

	Data/Masaka rises from the throne, begins walking down
	the stairs. She's regained her bearings now, and is
	trying to maintain control of the situation.

					DATA/MASAKA
			I thought I had escaped you.

	Picard smiles.

					PICARD
			You should know that's impossible.

					DATA/MASAKA
			You are a fine hunter... but I am
			a powerful prey. You will never
			catch me.

					PICARD
			Do you really want to be the
			prey... forever?

	Data/Masaka seems to consider this.

					DATA/MASAKA
			I thought I was alone here. I
			thought I wouldn't have to share
			the sky with you...

	Picard moves toward Data, carefully, not threatening,
	a reasonable man.

					PICARD
			But without me... you aren't
			complete. I know you, Masaka...
			you live for the chase just as
			much as I do.
					(MORE)

             STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FIVE            58.

56   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD (Cont'd)
				(beat)
			Won't you miss being the hunter...
			pursuing me... forcing me from the
			sky so that you can rise again?

	A hesitation.

					DATA/MASAKA
			You know me well, Korgano...

	Picard now senses he has the upper hand.

					PICARD
			I think you may be getting
			tired... it's difficult to
			brighten the sky forever...

	Data/Masaka smiles wanly... does seem a little weary.

					DATA/MASAKA
			I am getting sleepy... you always
			do that to me...

					PICARD
			Only so you can wake at dawn...
			and begin the hunt again...

	Another smile. Data/Masaka slowly sits on the throne,
	head still erect and queenly, but eyes heavy.

					DATA/MASAKA
			Begin the hunt again...
				(beat)
			I am eager for that.

					PICARD
			As am I.

	Data's eyes close. The ship TREMBLES. The room
	DISSOLVES to --

57   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	The temple is gone. Everyone is back in the corridor,
	reacting to the transformation. And to Data -- who
	stands before them, not wearing a mask (neither is
	Picard), blinking a bit in confusion.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Riker to Picard... I don't know
			what you did, sir... but it looks
			like everything's back to normal.

             STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/15/93 - ACT FIVE            59.

57   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Acknowledged.
				(to Data)
			Mister Data -- are you all right?

					DATA
			I believe so, sir. But I am not
			entirely certain what has
			happened. Have I been dreaming
			again?

	Picard puts his hand on Data's shoulder.

					PICARD
			I'm afraid it will take some time
			to explain.

	He smiles reassuringly and Data accepts this, his old
	equanimity having returned. Off their relieved
	expressions --

58   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship at impulse.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47612.4.
			Commander La Forge has managed to
			disable the alien transformation
			program. Starfleet will send an
			archaeological team to study the
			Archive further.

59   INT. READY ROOM

	Data with Picard; Picard holds the mask Data wore as
	Masaka, turning it in his hands.

					PICARD
			I don't understand... I thought
			all the alien artifacts had
			disappeared from the Enterprise.

					DATA
			This was not created by the
			Archive... this is the clay mask
			I originally made. I have since
			glazed it.

	Picard is intrigued.

             STAR TREK: "Masks" REV. 12/13/93 - ACT FIVE            60.

59   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Yes. Although I am relieved to be
			rid of those alien
			personalities... there is a sense
			in which I am now... empty.

					PICARD
			I can imagine. Doctor Crusher
			said there might have been dozens
			of personalities inside you.

					DATA
			I suspect the number was much
			greater.

	Data pauses, reflecting on the unusual experience.

					DATA
			My impression is that there were
			thousands... of all ages and walks
			of life.
				(beat)
			It was a remarkable experience.

					PICARD
			Well, Data, you may never become
			fully human... but you've had an
			experience that transcends the
			human condition.
				(beat)
			You have been an entire
			civilization.

	Data briefly ponders the significance of this... then
	Picard hands him back the mask.

					PICARD
				(wry)
			Nonetheless... it's time to stand
			watch on the night shift.

					DATA
			Yes, sir. Good night.

	He turns and EXITS.

									FADE OUT.
