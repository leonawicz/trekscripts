	hanging in space with the wormhole opening in the background.

2    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	Sisko's seated at his desk.  ODO and QUARK stand before him.

					ODO
			I found twenty-seven voles in his 
			storeroom.

					QUARK
			Vole infestations are not uncommon 
			on this station.  If you don't believe 
			me, ask Chief O'Brien.

					ODO
			When I came in, he and Morn were 
			painting numbers on the voles' backs.

					QUARK
			We were just... counting them to see 
			how many we'd caught.

					SISKO
			You were getting ready to stage a 
			vole fight.

       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/10/95 - TEASER        2.

2  CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(feigns surprise)
			A vole fight?  I'm appalled.
				(to Odo)
			Do you really think that was what 
			Morn was up to?

					SISKO
				(to Odo)
			I want the voles confiscated and 
			removed from the station.

					QUARK
			But you can't confiscate Morn's voles.  
			They're like... his pets.

	Sisko knows this is nonsense.  He stands up.

					SISKO
			I'll see if I can get him some 
			goldfish.  And now, if you gentlemen 
			will excuse me, it's late.

	Sisko EXITS.  They follow behind.

					QUARK
			Poor Morn.  This is going to break 
			his hearts.

3    OMITTED 

4    INT. OPS

	Sisko comes down the stairs and turns to an N.D. Starfleet 
	Officer.

					SISKO
			Ops is yours, Lieutenant.

	The Lieutenant nods.  Just then, O'BRIEN ENTERS from the 
	Turbolift, dressed like he was in the Mirror universe.

          DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - TEASER          3.

4  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(re: the clothes)
			Going somewhere, Chief?

	O'Brien stares at Sisko, Odo, and Quark with curious 
	intensity.

					O'BRIEN
			Sir, I need to talk to you.
				(eyeing Odo and Quark)
			It's kind of private.

					ODO
			We were just leaving.
				(to Quark)
			Come on, let's go break the news to 
			Morn.

	Odo and Quark EXIT out a door.  O'Brien looks at them 
	strangely.

					SISKO
				(to O'Brien)
			Do you want to talk in my office?

					O'BRIEN
			Actually, I thought we'd go to my 
			place.

	O'Brien draws a phaser and shoves it under Sisko's neck.

					O'BRIEN
			Get onto the transporter pad...
				(with an edge)
			Now.

	The Ops N.D.s are caught by surprise.

					SISKO
			What do you think you're doing?

					O'BRIEN
			Just get on the pad.

	O'Brien prods Sisko toward the transporter.  Sisko coolly 
	steps up onto the pad.  It doesn't seem like the time to 
	argue.

5    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Keeping his phaser trained on Sisko, O'Brien goes to Dax's 
	station.  He runs a device over the console, then programs 
	in a quick sequence of transporter commands.

          DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - TEASER          4.

5  CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Computer, energize on my command.

	Never taking his phaser off Sisko, O'Brien steps up to the 
	transporter and plays the (TECH) device over the base, then 
	joins Sisko on the pad.

					O'BRIEN
			Energize.

	They beam out.

6    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	With a ship very similar to the Maquis raider we saw in the 
	Voyager pilot.

7    INT. RAIDER - TRANSPORTER AREA (OPTICAL)

	A small transporter alcove like the one on the Defiant, but 
	less "Starfleet clean."  Sisko and O'Brien beam in.

	Sisko takes stock of his surroundings.

					SISKO
			Where are we?

					O'BRIEN
			I guess you might say we just stepped 
			through the looking glass.

	And as Sisko reacts to this, we...

									FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

8    INT. RAIDER - QUARTERS

	The doors open and Sisko ENTERS, followed by the Mirror 
	O'Brien, who is still holding a phaser on him.

					O'BRIEN
			Why don't you sit down... make 
			yourself comfortable?

					SISKO
				(re: the phaser)
			Maybe I'm not feeling too comfortable 
			right now.

	Sisko turns his back to O'Brien to sit down.  O'Brien relaxes 
	for a moment.  Suddenly Sisko pivots back to face O'Brien, 
	knocking the phaser away with his forearm, and with his other 
	hand clipping O'Brien on the jaw.  As O'Brien hits the wall, 
	Sisko wrests the phaser away and turns it on O'Brien.

					SISKO
			There, that's better.

	But to Sisko's surprise, O'Brien smiles as if Sisko's action 
	has been somehow reassuring to him.

					O'BRIEN
			That was a pretty good move.

					SISKO
			I'm glad you liked it.

					O'BRIEN
			But it still doesn't change anything.  
			You can't go home unless I reconfigure 
			the transporter, and I'm not about 
			to do that.
				(off Sisko's reaction)
			I guess you've got a lot of questions.

					SISKO
			Not as many as you think.

					O'BRIEN
			You know where we are?

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         5A.

8  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			If I had to guess, I'd say this is 
			the same parallel universe that two 
			of my crewmembers visited a year 
			ago.

					O'BRIEN
			You're quick.  Just like our Sisko.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE          6.

8  CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)
			That saves me having to give you a 
			history lesson.
				(a beat)
			But I'd better update you on current 
			events.  Since your officers left, 
			we've started a rebellion against 
			the Klingon/Cardassian Alliance.  
			We're fighting for our lives.

					SISKO
			I wish you luck, but I don't see 
			what that has to do with me.

					O'BRIEN
			It has everything to do with you.  
			You were the leader of the Terran 
			Rebellion.  At least, our Benjamin 
			Sisko was.

					SISKO
			Was?

					O'BRIEN
			Captain Sisko's dead.  The Cardassians 
			blew up his ship.

	Sisko doesn't need to have a picture drawn for him.

					SISKO
			And you want me to take his place.

					O'BRIEN
			Like I said, you're quick.

					SISKO
			Well I've got a better idea.  We're 
			going to walk back to the transporter 
			pad and you're going to send me home.

					O'BRIEN
			Wait.  Hear me out.  I'm not asking 
			for a lifetime commitment.  I just 
			need you to finish the mission Sisko 
			was on when he was killed.

					SISKO
			I'm sorry, but you're going to have 
			to find someone else.  I don't belong 
			here and I'm not about to interfere 
			with events in this universe.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE          7.

8  CONTINUED:	(3)

					O'BRIEN
			At least let me tell you about the 
			mission.  And then if you decide you 
			don't want to help, I'll send you 
			home.

	Sisko nods.

					O'BRIEN
			There's a Terran scientist working 
			for the Alliance.  According to our 
			sources, she's close to completing a 
			new transpectral sensor array that 
			will allow the Alliance to locate 
			our bases in the Badlands.  Without 
			a safe place to hide, the Alliance 
			will be able to track us down and 
			kill us all.

					SISKO
			So you want me to make sure this 
			scientist never finishes her project.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE          8.

8  CONTINUED:	(4)

					O'BRIEN
			Captain Sisko was convinced he could 
			change her mind, get her to work for 
			us instead.

					SISKO
			How did he plan to do that?

					O'BRIEN
			She was his wife.

	Off Sisko's surprised reaction, O'Brien hands Sisko a battered 
	PHOTO.

9    NEW ANGLE

	To include the PHOTO, a passport style shot of the Terran 
	Scientist.  It's JENNIFER SISKO.

					SISKO
			Jennifer.

					O'BRIEN
			You know her?

					SISKO
			She was my wife, too.  But in my 
			universe, she's dead.

					O'BRIEN
			Not here she isn't.  Not yet, anyway.

					SISKO
			What do you mean "not yet?"

					O'BRIEN
			If you don't convince Professor Sisko 
			to join our cause, we'll have no 
			choice but to kill her.

					SISKO
			Kill her?

					O'BRIEN
			We can't allow her to finish the 
			sensor array.  It'd mean the end of 
			the rebellion.

	Sisko reacts, looking down at Jennifer's picture.  After a 
	long beat, Sisko finally responds, never taking his eyes off 
	the picture.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         8A.

9  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I can't let her die.  Not again.

					O'BRIEN
			You're the only one who can save 
			her.

	Sisko finally looks up at O'Brien.  And off this moment...

10   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	Terok Nor (the Mirror Universe's equivalent of Deep Space 
	Nine) in orbit around Bajor.

       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/08/95 - ACT ONE       9.

11   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	The mirror KIRA is lounging on floor cushions, her back 
	cradled against the muscular chest of a handsome young Terran 
	slave.  Her Vulcan Eunuchs fan her while the slave feeds 
	her delicate morsels of food with his hands.  A second slave, 
	this one female, is sitting on the other side of her, holding 
	a bowl of food.

					KIRA
			Delectable.

	Kira slowly turns her head and the female slave reaches out 
	and delicately wipes Kira's lips with a napkin.  Kira gives 
	her a soulful smile.

					KIRA
			And so are you.

	But before Kira can elaborate, the door chimes.  Kira's been 
	expecting this.  She smiles.

					KIRA
			Enter.

	The door opens and...

12   NEW ANGLE

	A Terran woman ENTERS.  It's Sisko's wife, JENNIFER.  She's 
	dressed severely and has a solemn, taciturn disposition.

					JENNIFER
			Mister Garak said you wanted to see 
			me?

					KIRA
			That's right... Come... join us.

       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/08/95 - ACT ONE      10.

12  CONTINUED:

	But Jennifer stays where she is.


					JENNIFER
			If you're wondering when the new 
			sensor array will be finished, the 
			answer is--

					KIRA
				(finishing for her)
			As soon as possible.  I know.

					JENNIFER
			Will that be all?
				(off Kira's reaction)
			I have to get back to work.

	Kira stands up and approaches Jennifer.

					KIRA
			I have news about your husband.

					JENNIFER
			Nothing you could tell me about Ben 
			would interest me.  I haven't even 
			seen him in five years.

					KIRA
			I know that.  And I hope that will 
			make this easier for you.  You see... 
			Benjamin is dead.

	Jennifer betrays no feeling whatsoever.

					JENNIFER
			Can I go now?

					KIRA
			You must've loved him very much to 
			be so angry with him.  To have 
			become... so cold.

       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/08/95 - ACT ONE      11.

12  CONTINUED:	(2)

					JENNIFER
			Were other Terrans killed with him?

					KIRA
			A whole ship full.

	Now we see a sense of sadness in Jennifer.

					JENNIFER
			All this killing.  It has to stop.

					KIRA
			And it will.  As soon as you complete 
			your transpectral sensors.  Once we 
			locate the rebel bases, we can disarm 
			them and put an end to all this 
			bloodshed.  And I can resume pressing 
			the Alliance to be more reasonable 
			to its Terran population.

	Jennifer clearly doesn't have much hope for that, but ending 
	the Rebellion is reason enough for her to continue her 
	project.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			You do believe me, don't you?

	Kira smiles warmly at Jennifer.

13   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Raider maneuvers through a Badland plasma storm.

14   INT. RAIDER - CORRIDOR

	The Mirror O'Brien escorts Sisko back to the transporter.  
	Sisko is now dressed like his Mirror Universe counterpart.  
	They pass some crewmembers, who salute him.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         12.

14  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			So it's agreed.  I help you get 
			Jennifer away from the Alliance, 

			then you send me home.

					O'BRIEN
			You get us Jennifer and we'll do 
			anything you want.  I just hope you 
			can convince her to leave Terok Nor.

					SISKO
			I don't understand what she's doing 
			helping the Alliance in the first 
			place.  I mean, didn't she know Sisko 
			was leading the Rebellion?

					O'BRIEN
			Oh, she knew.
				(a beat)
			The truth is... She and Captain Sisko 
			didn't get along too well.  But then 
			again, the captain didn't really get 
			along with anyone.

15   NEW ANGLE

	They reach the transporter pad.

					O'BRIEN
			In some ways I think the rebellion's 
			better off without him.  Don't get 
			me wrong, the captain knew how to 
			fight... but that's about all he 
			knew.

	O'Brien sets up the transporter.

					O'BRIEN
			Ready?

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         13.

15  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			You don't look very confident, 
			Chief...

					O'BRIEN
			You better start calling me Smiley.  
			That's what the Captain called me.

					SISKO
			All right... "Smiley."

					O'BRIEN
			I just wish we had more time to get 
			you ready.  I probably haven't told 
			you half of what you need to know.  
			I hope you don't run up against too 
			many surprises.

	Sisko steps onto the transporter pad.

					SISKO
			If I do, I guess I'll just have to... 
			improvise.

	Sisko smiles.  O'Brien joins Sisko on the pad and they beam 
	out.

16   INT. CAVES - MAIN CHAMBER

	The central meeting hall for Sisko's group of rebels.  There 
	are a number of familiar faces in the crowd.  One or two 
	supernumeraries we've seen before on Deep Space Nine, the 
	scarred privateer from "CROSSOVER," and a hardened, heavily
	armed professional soldier named ROM.

	The rebels are in the middle of a vociferous argument, with 
	one faction lead by JULIAN BASHIR and the other by TUVOK, 
	the Vulcan from "VOYAGER."  They're a stark contrast in 
	styles.  Tuvok is a coldly logical soldier, and Bashir's a 
	hothead with a scruffy four days growth of beard and a 
	permanent bad attitude.

					BASHIR
				(to all)
			I told Sisko he'd never get close to 
			Terok Nor, and I was right.

       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/03/95 - ACT ONE      14.

16  CONTINUED:

					ROM
			I say we teach the Alliance a lesson.  
			Throw everything we've got at Terok 
			Nor and rip it to pieces.

					TUVOK
			I disagree.  Following your suggestion 
			would do nothing to enhance our goals 
			and would result in a significant 
			loss of life.

					ROM
			That's easy for you to say.  Those 
			Cardassian pigs didn't kill your 
			brother.

					TUVOK
			We have all suffered losses at the 
			hands of the Alliance.  Nonetheless, 
			logic dictates caution in the face 
			of a superior enemy.

					ROM
			Logic isn't going to win us our 
			freedom.  We have to take action.

					BASHIR
			And we will.  But this time we do it 
			my way.

					TUVOK
			And what do you propose we do?

					BASHIR
			We smuggle explosives on board the 
			station, plant them in her quarters, 
			and detonate them.

					TUVOK
			You realize it's highly unlikely 
			that anyone assigned to such a mission 
			would survive.

					BASHIR
			I say it's worth the risk.

					SISKO (O.S.)
			Does that mean you're volunteering 
			for the job?

	Sisko's arrival.

					REBELS
				(ad lib)
			Captain... You're back... Where have 
			you been... Captain Sisko...

					ROM
			Captain, you're alive.

	For a beat, Sisko's a little taken aback at seeing the mirror 
	counterparts of Rom and Bashir.  O'Brien, seeing Sisko's 
	hesitation, steps in.

					O'BRIEN
			Of course he's alive.  You can't 
			kill the Captain.  He's too ornery 
			to die.

	Sisko picks up on O'Brien's cue and snaps into the Captain 
	Sisko role.

					SISKO
				(re: Bashir)
			I hope I haven't disappointed anyone.

					BASHIR
				(with some reluctance)
			We're glad you're all right.

					SISKO
			I'm sure you are.

					TUVOK
			We heard your fighter had been 
			destroyed.  The Alliance said you 
			were dead.

					SISKO
			Just their propaganda machine, working 
			overtime.  But you know what that 
			tells me?
				(smiles)
			They're scared.

	The smiles and affirmations from the crowd show that they 
	agree with him.  Sisko's only been back a few seconds, and 
	he's already got them in the palm of his hand.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE        15A.

17  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			And we're going to give them plenty 
			of reasons to stay scared.

	Just then someone pushes through the crowd toward Sisko.  
	It's JADZIA DAX.

					DAX
			It's about time you came back.

	This Dax is an aggressive rebel leader, even more roguish 
	than her counterpart in our universe.

				(covering his surprise)
			Jadzia.

	She pushes her way toward him, throws her arms around his 
	neck, and gives him a passionate kiss.

					DAX
			That's to let you know I missed you.

	Dax then steps back and slaps Sisko across the face.

					DAX
			And that's for letting me think you 
			were dead.

	Sisko smiles and rubs his cheek.

					SISKO
			Glad to see you still care.

	Dax smiles, then turns and walks away.  She looks back at 
	Sisko.

					DAX
			You coming or not?

	All the rebels grin as Dax walks out of the room.  The scarred 
	privateer gives Sisko a man-bonding pat on the back.  Sisko 
	takes O'Brien aside.

					SISKO
				(sotto voce)
			I thought you said I was married.

					O'BRIEN
			You are... technically.  She's your 
			mistress.

					SISKO
			I see what you meant by surprises.

	And as Sisko tries to decide what to do next, we...

18   INT. CAVES - PRIVATE CHAMBER

	Dax pushes aside a tapestry hanging in front of a tunnel and 
	ENTERS a small cavern room that's been converted into a 
	private sleeping area.  She turns to the entranceway and as 
	Sisko ENTERS, she pulls off her shirt, leaving only her 
	undershirt.  She's very matter-of-fact and obviously 
	comfortable with Sisko.  They've been here before.

					DAX
			I really am glad you're alive.

	She walks over to him and begins unbuttoning his shirt.

					DAX
			And I'm going to make you glad you're 
			alive, too.

	He grabs her wrists as if to stop her.

					SISKO
			We have a lot of planning to do.

	Dax looks at him like he's insane.

					DAX
			It can wait.

	Sisko realizes he's in danger of blowing his cover.  There's 
	no way out of this; he has to play his part.  He lets go of 
	her wrists.

					SISKO
			I suppose it can at that.

	And as she smiles and presses up against him...

									CUT TO:

19   INT. INTENDANT'S OFFICE

	Kira disdainfully hands Garak a PADD.

					KIRA
			These progress reports are

			percent.  We've got to do better.
				(glares at him)
			Or are you purposely trying to make

					GARAK
			Not at all.  I've done everything I

					KIRA
			Such as?

					GARAK
			Bribes... torture... I've even given 
			the overseers permission to execute 
			any worker who's not meeting the 
			quota.

					KIRA
			I'm sure that pleases the overseers,

			Come with me.

	She EXITS.  He follows her.

21   INT. ORE PROCESSING CENTER (OPTICAL)

	As hellish and dark as when we saw it in "CROSSOVER." Terran 
	laborers work in terrible conditions to process the dirty 
	ore.

	Kira and Garak ENTER, and are immediately joined by a 
	Cardassian overseer and two Bajoran guards.  Kira looks around 
	at the hellish squalor, then points at three random workers.

					KIRA
			Lets start with...

			Him, him, and her.

21   CONTINUED:

					GARAK
			And do what?

					KIRA
			Execute them.
				(off his reaction)
			I think you'll find that random and 
			unprovoked executions will keep your 
			entire workforce alert and motivated.

	There's a beat as Garak reflects on these words of wisdom.

					GARAK
				(smiles)
			I bow to your brilliance.

	Garak turns to the overseer and his assistants, who begin 
	rounding up the victims.

					GARAK
				(continuing, to Kira)
			Though I hope your mood improves 
			before we run out of workers.

					KIRA
			What does my mood have to do with 
			anything?

					GARAK
			If you don't mind my saying so, I 
			have noticed a certain amount of ill-
			humor on your part lately.

					KIRA
			I don't know what you're talking 
			about.

					GARAK
			As I recall, it began about the time 
			you learned of Captain Sisko's death.

					KIRA
			Why would I be upset by such 
			delightful news?

					GARAK
			I was always under the impression 
			that you were rather fond of him.

					KIRA
			Then you were mistaken.

       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/03/95 - ACT TWO      21.

21   CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK
			I will say one thing for him.  He 
			had spirit.

					KIRA
			Too much spirit can be a dangerous 
			thing.  It tends to infect others.

	In the background, the overseer finishes rounding up the 
	workers chosen by Kira.

					GARAK
			At least that's something we won't 
			have to worry about anymore.  With 
			Sisko's death, and the imminent 
			completion of the transpectral sensor 
			array, the Rebellion is certain to 
			collapse.

					KIRA
			You sound very sure of yourself.

					GARAK
			I am.

					KIRA
			I'll remember that.  That way if the 
			Rebellion continues, I'll know who 
			to blame.

	In the background, the guards execute the workers.  Kira 
	EXITS.

22   INT. CAVES - PRIVATE CHAMBER

	Dax is lounging on the sleeping cushion.  Sisko is studying 
	a PADD.

					SISKO
			Are you sure these Alliance patrol

			Those days are gone.

					DAX
			Maybe... but I'm tired of living

					SISKO
			Don't you want to see the Terrans 
			gain their freedom?

					DAX
			Have you taken a good look at your

			ex-slaves with delusions of grandeur.  
			They'll never overthrow the Alliance.
				(urgent)
			Let's just take a ship and go... 
			Forget all about the rebellion.

					SISKO
			I'm not ready to give up just yet.

					DAX
			It's not like you're going to have 
			much of a choice... once that witch

			Trying to reach Terok Nor using small

					SISKO
			You tell them, Smiley.  At least

	O'Brien and Sisko are at the controls of the rebel ship.

			Don't do that.

			I can't help it.  It itches.

			Do you have any idea what went wrong 
			between her and Captain Sisko?

					O'BRIEN
			From what I heard, they never 
			should've been together in the first

			the few privileged Terran families, 
			people who "cooperated" with the 
			Alliance, and the captain... he fought

					SISKO
			So what's she like, this Jennifer?

					O'BRIEN
			I wouldn't know.  They separated

			She was the kindest, most caring

			But that wasn't enough for you, was

	O'Brien finally looks her in the eye.

					O'BRIEN
			I wanted to be free.

			Bring me to the Intendant's quarters.  
			She'll decide what to do with me.

	Garak loses his cool.

	Garak realizes he's overstepped his bounds.

					GARAK
				(almost whining)
			But you promised me he'd die.

			And he will... When I say so, and

			Of course you do.

			And if it wasn't women, it was that 
			ship of yours.  Sometimes I think it 
			was the only thing you ever loved.

					SISKO
			Maybe I loved you both.

					JENNIFER
			Then why did you leave me to run off 
			and play pirate for the Intendant?

					SISKO
			That's a good question.

					JENNIFER
			And now this Rebellion of yours.
				(a beat)
			Do you know how many deaths you've 
			caused?  How much destruction?

					SISKO
			I'm fighting to help free our people.

					JENNIFER
			You're fighting because you like to 
			fight, Benjamin.

					JENNIFER
			All you've accomplished is to give

				(a beat)
			I only hope that with your capture, 
			the Rebellion can be ended peacefully.

					SISKO
			Who said I'd been captured?

					JENNIFER
			Oh, I suppose you came here just to 
			see me?

					SISKO
				(with simple sincerity)
			Actually, I came here to rescue you.

	And on Jennifer's surprised reaction, we...

	FADE IN:

36   INT. GUEST QUARTERS (CONTINUOUS)

	As before.  Jennifer reacts to Sisko's statement.

					JENNIFER
			Rescue me?

					SISKO
			That's what I said.

					JENNIFER
			I'm not going anywhere with you.

					SISKO
			You can't stay here.

					JENNIFER
			I have a job to finish.

					SISKO
			You mean the sensor array?

					JENNIFER
			That's right.

					SISKO
			Jennifer, if you finish that array 
			you'll destroy any hope our people 
			have for a better future.  I don't 
			think you want that.

					JENNIFER
			All I want is to put an end to all 
			this fighting.  To force the rebels 
			to seek a peaceful settlement with 
			the Alliance.

					SISKO
			It's not that simple.  The Alliance 
			isn't interested in a peaceful 
			settlement.  If we lay down our arms, 
			we'll be killed.

					JENNIFER
			The Rebellion is killing people every 
			day.  It has to stop.

					SISKO
			Not this way.  Not with the Terrans 
			still at the mercy of the Alliance.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FOUR        40.

36   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(a beat)
			They're your own people, Jennifer.

					JENNIFER
			You've got no right to talk to me 
			like that.  Since when do you care 
			about what happens to "our           
			people?"  You've never cared about 
			anyone but yourself.

	But to Jennifer's surprise, this doesn't get a rise out of 
	Sisko.

					SISKO
			Maybe I've changed in the past few 
			years.

					JENNIFER
				(a bitter smile)
			How many times have I heard you say 
			that?

	A beat as Sisko realizes just how deeply hurt Jennifer must 
	have been by the other Sisko.

					SISKO
			I guess I was a pretty lousy husband.

					JENNIFER
				(with an edge)
			You guess?

					SISKO
			Look, I know it's too late for an 
			apology...

					JENNIFER
				(jumping in)
			You're right about that.

					SISKO
			But for what it's worth, I'm sorry.

	Jennifer looks at Sisko in surprise.

					SISKO
			What is it?

					JENNIFER
			For a second, I almost believed you.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FOUR        41.

36   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Jennifer turns away from Sisko and stares off into the 
	distance.

					JENNIFER
			You know what I wish?
				(off his look)
			I wish I'd never met you.

					SISKO
			And I wish things could've been better 
			between us.  But this isn't about 
			us.

	Sisko pauses as he realizes something.

					SISKO
			Or is it?
				(off her reaction)
			Why are you working for the Alliance?  
			Is it because you believe in what 
			they're doing or is it something 
			else?

					JENNIFER
			I don't know what you're talking 
			about.

					SISKO
			I think you and I have been fighting 
			each other for so long that you've 
			gotten used to us being on opposite 
			sides.  But I'm not the enemy this 
			time, Jennifer.  The Alliance is.

					JENNIFER
			The Alliance is your enemy.  Not 
			mine.

					SISKO
			That's where you're wrong.  Don't 
			you see, you're no different than 
			the slaves working in the Ore 
			Processing Center.  In fact, you 
			might be even worse off.  At least 
			they know they're prisoners.

	This time Sisko's gotten through to her.  Jennifer deflates 
	a little.

					JENNIFER
			And what if I am a prisoner?

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FOUR       41A.

			You don't have to be.  You can fight

36   CONTINUED:	(4)

					JENNIFER
			You want me to join the Rebellion.

					SISKO
			The way I see it... Freedom is a lot 
			better than slavery.

	Jennifer looks appraisingly at Sisko for a long beat, but 
	she still can't come to a decision.

					SISKO
			Think about it.

	Sisko presses a spot behind his ear, three times in rapid 
	succession.

					JENNIFER
			What are you doing?

					SISKO
			Sending a message.

					JENNIFER
				(surprised)
			You've got a subdermal communicator?

					SISKO
			Courtesy of the Ferengi.  I hope it 
			works.

37   INT. ORE PROCESSING CENTER

	O'Brien labors in the Ore Processing Center, carting ore 
	into the smelter.  A Cardassian Overseer keeps a watchful 
	eye on the workers.  As O'Brien passes close to the Overseer, 
	he reaches behind his ear and touches the spot he was 
	scratching earlier.  He smiles.

					O'BRIEN
				(to himself)
			Took him long enough.

	O'Brien moves to another part of the processing area.  Once 
	he's out of sight of the Overseer, he goes to an access panel 
	and pops it open.

	O'Brien begins working on the circuitry inside the panel, 
	when someone approaches him from behind.

					CARDASSIAN OVERSEER
			Terran, what are you doing down there?

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FOUR        43.

37   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Re-routing the central ODN processor.  
			Intendant's orders.

	The Cardassian crouches down to get a better look at the 
	panel.

					CARDASSIAN OVERSEER
			I don't recall receiving clearance 
			for any repairs.

	Suddenly, O'Brien lashes out and cold-cocks the Overseer.  
	The Cardassian crumples to the ground.

					O'BRIEN
			You don't say?

	O'Brien turns back to the panel and triggers something in 
	the circuitry.  Suddenly the lights short out, things explode 
	inside the ore processing equipment and the doors open.  
	The workers and the two Bajoran guards stand around, not 
	sure what's happening.

38   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	As O'Brien grabs the Overseer's phaser and shoots one of the 
	Bajoran guards.  That wakes the workers up.  They begin 
	swarming over the last guard, rapidly overwhelming them.

					O'BRIEN
				(addressing the workers)
			All right, anyone who wants to get 
			out of here, follow me.

	O'Brien heads for the door, and with a cheer, the Terran 
	workers follow him.

39   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	Two Klingons stand guard in the corridor.  Suddenly the lights 
	go down, and a half second later, the door opens and Sisko 
	spins out.  The First Klingon barely has time to react before 
	Sisko stops him cold with a one-two combination to the head.

	The Second Klingon manages to draw his disruptor, but, before 
	he can fire, Sisko retrieves the disruptor from the First 
	Klingon and shoots the Second one.

	As Jennifer ENTERS the corridor and looks at the unconscious 
	Klingons, Sisko picks up the Second Klingon's disruptor.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FOUR        44.

39   CONTINUED:

	Jennifer stares at the weapons in Sisko's hands, almost 
	as if she expects him to use them on her.

					SISKO
			I need an answer, Jennifer.  Are you 
			coming with me or not?

					JENNIFER
			Do I have a choice?

					SISKO
			Of course you do.  If you want, you 
			can go back to your quarters and 
			forget we ever spoke.

	She hesitates.  Sisko presses.

					SISKO
			It's up to you.

	Jennifer thinks for a moment longer, then walks over to him.

					JENNIFER
			All right, but lets get one thing 
			clear.

					SISKO
			What's that?

					JENNIFER
				(with a smile)
			I still hate you.

					SISKO
				(with regret)
			I know.

	They head off together down the corridor.

41   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	Sisko and Jennifer on the move.

					JENNIFER
			You still haven't told me where we're 
			going.

					SISKO
			Airlock Seven.  There should be a 
			ship waiting for us.  Providing we 
			can get there before the security 
			systems reactivate.

	They turn a corner and almost run right into...

42   THREE CARDASSIAN SOLDIERS (OPTICAL)

	The Cardassians open fire.  Sisko and Jennifer duck back 
	down the corridor.  A firefight ensues.  Sisko shoots one of 
	the soldiers, but he and Jennifer are pinned down.

					JENNIFER
			Now what?

      DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/10/95 - ACT FOUR      46.

					SISKO
			I'll think of something.

	Suddenly we hear the sound of more phaser fire.

43   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	To reveal O'Brien and the escaped Terrans coming up from 
	behind the remaining Cardassian soldiers.  The two Cardassians 
	are caught in a crossfire between Sisko and O'Brien and soon 
	go down.

					SISKO
				(to Jennifer)
			You see.  I told you I'd think of 
			something.
				(to O'Brien)
			Good work, Smiley.

					O'BRIEN
			Yeah, but the problem is there's 
			thirty more of them behind us.

					SISKO
			Then we'd better get to the airlock.

	Sisko leads O'Brien, Jennifer and the rest of the Terrans 
	away down a corridor.

44   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	Sisko and the others move down the corridor.  They reach the 
	airlock, only to stop in their tracks as they see Rom's dead 
	body, hung spreadeagled across the airlock door.

					JENNIFER
			Something tells me that's not part 
			of your plan.

45   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

	As Sisko and the others react to Rom's dead body.

					O'BRIEN
			We better find another way out of 
			here.

					SISKO
			Got any suggestions?

	Just then, a hail of phaser fire comes from down the hall, 
	hitting one of the slaves.

					SISKO
			Fall back.

	Sisko and the Terrans move back around the opposite corner, 
	so that they're out of the line of fire, just as...

46   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Kira, Garak, and a squad of Alliance Guards appear from around 
	the corner.  Kira signals the Guards and they hold their 
	fire.

					KIRA
			That was very clever, Benjamin, having 
			one of your own men betray you so 
			you could get aboard the station.  
			You had me totally fooled.  Luckily 
			Mister Garak is somewhat more cynical 
			than I.

					GARAK
			Your Ferengi friend told us your 
			entire plan... with a little 
			persuasion.

					KIRA
			I'm afraid there's no escape.  Your 
			ship's locked down, your pilot's 
			dead.  There's no way out.
				(a beat)
			You might as well surrender.

47   ANGLE ON THE TERRANS

	As they realize they're trapped.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FIVE        49.

47   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			If we surrender, she'll kill us.

					SISKO
			Us, maybe, but not Jennifer.

	Jennifer isn't about to let Sisko and the others sacrifice 
	themselves for her.

					JENNIFER
			What if we offer a trade?  I stay 
			here and she lets you live.

48   ANGLE ON KIRA AND GARAK

	As they wait to see what Sisko will do.

					KIRA
			Benjamin, you know how I hate to be 
			kept waiting.

	Kira signals to some of her men who move off in an attempt 
	to flank Sisko.

49   ANGLE ON SISKO'S GROUP

	As Sisko makes a decision.

					SISKO
				(to Jennifer)
			I came a long way to get you out of 
			here, and I'm not leaving without 
			you.

	Jennifer stares at Sisko for a beat, puzzled.

					SISKO
			What is it?

					JENNIFER
			Nothing.

	But she still continues to study Sisko.

					SISKO
				(thinking on his feet)
			Smiley, how far is the Ore Processing 
			Center?

					O'BRIEN
			Only a couple of levels away.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FIVE        50.

49   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Take us there.

					O'BRIEN
				(doesn't see the point)
			What for?

					SISKO
			I'll show you when we get there.

	O'Brien nods.

50   ANGLE ON KIRA

	As she runs out of patience.

					KIRA
				(calling out)
			Time's up, Benjamin...
				(no response)
			Benjamin?

	Garak signals to the Guards who cautiously round the corner.  
	We stay with Kira and Garak.  They listen for phaser fire, 
	but when they don't hear any, they follow the Guards around 
	the corner.

51   NEW ANGLE
	As Kira reacts to the fact that Sisko and the rest of the 
	Terrans have retreated down a side corridor.

					KIRA
			He always has to make things 
			difficult.

					GARAK
			It's one of his least endearing 
			qualities.

	Kira marches off down the corridor, followed by Garak and 
	her soldiers.

52   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	Sisko and the rest of the Terrans retreat down the corridor.  
	The Terrans are slowed down because they have to help one of 
	their injured members along.  Sisko brings up the rear, his 
	stolen disruptor at the ready.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FIVE        51.

52   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Hurry.  They're right behind us.

	Sisko catches a glimpse of a Bajoran soldier.  He opens fire.  
	The Bajorans return fire.

53   INT. ORE PROCESSING CENTER (OPTICAL)

	Under heavy phaser fire, the Terrans retreat into the Ore 
	Processing Room.  One of them gets hit in the doorway.  Sisko, 
	the last man in, drags the wounded Terran to safety.

					SISKO
				(shouting, to O'Brien)
			Smiley, seal the doors.

	But the room is full of phaser fire and O'Brien's having a 
	tough time staying alive, let alone reaching the door 
	controls.

					O'BRIEN
				(to himself)
			Easy for you to say.

	But O'Brien makes a lunge for the controls and the doors 
	begin to seal.  With one last burst of energy, Sisko manages 
	to get the wounded Terran inside the Processing Center just 
	as the doors close behind him.

	Sisko joins Jennifer.

					SISKO
				(to Jennifer)
			I'll get you out of this, I promise.

					JENNIFER
				(simply)
			I believe you.

	A moment passes between them.  It's brief, but for the first 
	time since Sisko met this Jennifer, some of her hard veneer 
	slips away.

	Sisko moves to a control panel, where he's joined by O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN
				(aside, to Sisko)
			Captain, I don't know what you're up 
			to, but there's no way out of this 
			place except through that door.

					SISKO
				(aside to O'Brien)
			Don't worry.  I know what I'm doing.
				(almost to himself)
			I just hope your Terok Nor was 
			designed by the same Cardassian who 
			built my Terok Nor.

	And as he works on the panel...

54   INT. CORRIDOR

	Kira, Garak and the rest of Kira's troops have arrived outside 
	the Ore Processing Center doors.

					KIRA
				(to a soldier)
			You're sure they're all in there?

	The soldier nods.  Kira looks satisfied.

					KIRA
			Good.  Then we've got them.  Use the 
			manual override to open the doors.

					GARAK
			Intendant, I trust this time you 
			won't be so lenient with our dear 
			Mister Sisko.

					KIRA
			Don't worry.  He's disappointed me 
			for the last time.

	Garak smiles.  That's what he wanted to hear.

55   INT. ORE PROCESSING CENTER

	As the doors open and Alliance troops rush in to find...

56   NEW ANGLE

	Sisko and the other Terrans standing there, waiting for them, 
	with no weapons in sight.

	Kira marches in with Garak at her side.  Kira surveys the 
	Terrans and notices Jennifer.

56   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Jennifer.  I was so worried about 
			you.  But you're safe now.  In fact, 
			I can assure you your husband will 
			never annoy you again.

	Kira holds out her hand to Jennifer, but Jennifer doesn't 
	take it.

					JENNIFER
			Actually, for the first time since I 
			met him, he's not annoying me.  In 
			fact, he's been making a lot of sense.

					KIRA
			He can be persuasive when he wants 
			to be.  I suppose that means you 
			won't be finishing the sensor array.

	Sisko looks to Jennifer to see what she will decide.  Jennifer 
	catches his eye and gives him a slight smile.

					JENNIFER
				(a simple explanation)
			I'm a Terran.

	Kira nods.  It's like an iron door has been closed.  Any 
	feelings she might have had for Sisko or Jennifer are gone.

					KIRA
				(to her troops)
			Keep her alive.  Kill the others.

	But before the soldiers can execute her orders, Sisko steps 
	forward.

					SISKO
			I wouldn't.  You'd be making a 
			mistake.

					KIRA
			My only mistake was not executing 
			you in the first place.

					SISKO
			You don't know how right you are.
				(points to a panel)
			I've activated the station's self-
			destruct sequence.  Unless I disarm 
			it, this whole place will blow up 
			in...

56   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Sisko checks the readout on the panel.

					SISKO
			Nine minutes.

					KIRA
			That's impossible.  There's no way 
			you could know the station's command 
			access code.

					SISKO
			Alpha Nine One Seven Five Blue.

	Judging from Kira's reaction, Sisko's right.

					KIRA
				(to com)
			Computer, disengage self-destruct 
			sequence.  Authorization Kira Alpha 
			Nine One Seven Five Blue.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Authorization denied.

					SISKO
				(playful)
			I changed it.
				(checks panel)
			You've got eight minutes and thirty 
			seconds to let us go.  Otherwise we 
			all die.

					GARAK
			Don't listen to him.  He's bluffing.

	Kira stares at Sisko for a long beat, taking his measure.  
	Sisko returns her stare, unflinchingly.

					KIRA
			He's not bluffing.

					GARAK
			How do you know?

					KIRA
			I know.
				(to Sisko)
			Give me the new access code and I'll 
			let you go.

         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT FIVE        55.

				(a beat)
			Do we have a deal?

	Kira looks at Sisko for a beat longer, then nods to the 
	guards.  Sisko and the rest of the Terrans begin to walk 
	out.  Kira stops Sisko for second.

					KIRA
			This isn't over Benjamin.  I'll hunt 
			you down.  I swear it.

					SISKO
			You're welcome to try.

	Once the last Terran has left the room, Sisko follows them 
	out.

57   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Badlands.

58   INT. CAVE CORRIDOR

	Sisko is walking with Bashir and O'Brien, having just returned 
	to the rebel encampment.

					BASHIR
			I still don't understand why you 
			gave them the access code.  You 
			could've gotten away and still 
			destroyed the station.

					SISKO
			But we gave our word.

					BASHIR
			Our word.  Who gives a damn whether 
			we keep our word?

					O'BRIEN
			I do.

	Bashir is surprised by the air of conviction in O'Brien's

59   INT. CAVES - MAIN CHAMBER

	Where Jadzia and Jennifer are seated together talking quietly.  
	We don't hear what they're saying.  Neither does Sisko as he 
	walks up to them.

					SISKO
			I'm glad to see the two of you are 
			getting along.

					DAX
			We have a lot in common.

	All three of them know that she means Sisko.

					DAX
				(to Jennifer)
			He's all yours.

	Dax smiles to herself and EXITS.  O'Brien and Bashir realize 
	Sisko wants to be alone with Jennifer, and they follow after 
	Dax.

60   CLOSE ON JENNIFER AND SISKO

	Jennifer studies Sisko's face.

					JENNIFER
			Dax tells me you're leaving.

					SISKO
			I'm going to pay a call on the

			them to help us.

					JENNIFER
			Then I guess this is good-bye.

	Already this isn't easy for Sisko.  He's torn with emotion.  
	He knows he's not saying good-bye to his Jennifer, but it 
	feels like it anyway.

					SISKO
			Again.
				(a beat)
			Jennifer, there's so much I want to 
			say to you, but I don't know where

	Sisko considers trying to continue the charade, but thinks

			When did you figure it out?

			They're too kind.
				(a beat)
			There was nothing kind about Ben.
				(another beat)
			He's dead, isn't he?

					SISKO
			I'm sorry.

					JENNIFER
			Don't be.
				(a beat)
			So, who are you, really?

					SISKO
			It's a long story.  Talk to Smiley.  
			He can fill you in on the details.

					JENNIFER
			He seems like a good man.

					SISKO
			He does at that.
				(a beat)
			So what are you going to do now?

					JENNIFER
			Oh, I'm sure Smiley will find 
			something to keep me busy.
				(a beat)
			You're not really going to visit the 
			Romulans, are you?

					SISKO
				(shakes his head)
			The deal was I get you off the 
			station, and then I go home.

					JENNIFER
			Will I see you again?

					SISKO
			I don't know.

	Jennifer leans over and kisses Sisko on the cheek.

					JENNIFER
			Thank you for... rescuing me.

					SISKO
			It was... my pleasure.

	They stand there for a beat, looking at each other, then the 
	mood is broken by O'Brien, returning to the chamber.

					O'BRIEN
			Ready, Captain?

1    INT. REPLIMAT

	BASHIR and O'BRIEN are having lunch.  O'Brien is eating with 
	a hearty appetite, while Bashir picks at his food.  Bashir 
	is trying to get a conversation going, but not having much 
	success -- O'Brien's responses are limited to nods and shrugs.

					BASHIR
			... if you ask me, modern human 
			theater has been on the decline since 
			the late twenty-third century.

	O'Brien makes a motion that might be a shrug.

					BASHIR
				(continuing)
			I mean, look at the plays coming out 
			of Earth for the last fifty years 
			and then compare them to the works 
			of Willemheld, Barton or Chow-yun.

	O'Brien gives him a distracted nod as he concentrates on the 
	food.  Bashir makes one last attempt.

					BASHIR
				(continuing)
			Modern playwrights have become 
			obsessed with writing human 
			interpretations of alien theatrical 
			works and they're ignoring our own 
			unique cultural heritage in hopes of -- 
			Chief, are you listening to me?

	O'Brien looks up in surprise with a mouthful of food.

					O'BRIEN
			What?

       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - TEASER        2.

1    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			I thought so.

					O'BRIEN
			I heard every word you said.
				(off Bashir's look)
			I have.
				(thinking)
			Chow-yun, Barton, alien theatrical 
			works, ignoring our cultural 
			heritage...

					BASHIR
			And what do you think?

					O'BRIEN
			About what?

					BASHIR
			Any of it.

					O'BRIEN
			I... don't know.  What do you want 
			me to say?

					BASHIR
			Say you agree.  Say you disagree.  
			Say you hate theater.  Just say 
			something.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, Julian, you said you wanted to 
			have lunch... so we're having lunch.

					BASHIR
			Yes.  But I was hoping for a little 
			more... conversation with my plomeek 
			soup.

					O'BRIEN
			My mother taught me that if you 
			combine eating and talking, you'll 
			end up doing neither one very well.

       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - TEASER       2A.

1    CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
				(smiles)
			Well, I suppose Garak taught me to 
			think of lunch as a sort of... arena 
			for philosophical debate.

	Bashir's face looks a little melancholy... concerned about 
	his friend.

					BASHIR
			I take it there's still no word about 
			Garak and Odo?

					O'BRIEN
				(shakes his head)
			The starship Portland and a Cardassian 
			cruiser are still searching the Algira 
			Sector for the runabout.
				(beat)
			That's not entirely bad news.  If 
			the runabout had been destroyed they'd 
			certainly have found debris by now 
			or some kind of--

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Kira to O'Brien.

1    CONTINUED:	(3)

					O'BRIEN
				(to com)
			O'Brien here, Major.

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Report to Ops, Chief.  There's 
			something here we'd like you to take 
			a look at.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm on my way.
				(to Bashir)
			Sorry.

					BASHIR
			It's all right.

	O'Brien EXITS.  Bashir contemplates the empty seat.

					BASHIR
				(to chair)
			So... read any good books lately?

									CUT TO:

2    INT. OPS (VPB)

	SISKO and DAX are showing something to O'Brien on a monitor 
	as KIRA looks on.

					SISKO
				(re: monitor)
			About ten minutes ago, our sensors 
			picked up high concentrations of 
			tetryon particles moving toward the 
			station.

					DAX
			I've never seen readings like this 
			before.  What do you think?

					O'BRIEN
				(off monitor)
			Subspace energy fluctuations... 
			quantum fractures in the 
			electrodynamic field... EM spikes 
			across the spectrum... you've got 
			me.

					KIRA
			Whatever it is, it's getting closer.

          DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - TEASER          4.

2    CONTINUED:

					DAX
			And larger.  The tetryon 
			concentrations have increased ten 
			percent in the last thirty seconds.

	An ALARM goes off on one of the consoles.

					DAX
				(off console)
			There's an energy surge bearing two 
			one zero mark three one five... a 
			ship is decloaking.
				(beat)
			It's a Romulan warbird.

					SISKO
			Romulans?  Open a channel to--

	Another ALARM.

					DAX
			Another warbird decloaking at zero 
			one zero -- no!  It's a Cardassian 
			ship.

					KIRA
				(shocked)
			A Cardassian ship with a cloaking 
			device?

					DAX
			Definitely Cardassian.  Keldon class.
				(she reacts to 
				something on the 
				screen)
			Benjamin... there's an entire fleet 
			decloaking out there.

					SISKO
			Red Alert.  Shields up, stand by 
			weapons.

3    EXT. SPACE - THE FLEET (OPTICAL)

	An entire FLEET of Romulan and Cardassian ships is now hanging 
	off the station.  The ships begin in the foreground and 
	stretch off into the distance until they become mere specks 
	of light.  A couple of the ships are still decloaking.

4    INT. OPS

	Everyone is watching the viewscreen in shock.

          DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - TEASER          5.

4    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(to Dax)
			Try to hail them, lieutenant.

					O'BRIEN
				(off monitor)
			Their weapons are charged... but 
			they haven't locked onto us yet.

					KIRA
			The lead ship is heading for the 
			wormhole, commander.

5    INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	which shows a Romulan warbird starting to enter the wormhole.

					DAX
			No response to our hails.

					KIRA
			The fleet is following the lead 
			ship... they're heading for the Gamma 
			Quadrant.

					SISKO
				(grim, to Dax)
			Lieutenant, open a priority channel 
			and get me Starfleet Command.  Now.

	Off Sisko's face as he watches the endless parade of ships 
	heading for the Gamma Quadrant...

									FADE OUT.

6    INT. ROMULAN READY ROOM

	TAIN is seated at the table with a drink as GARAK pours 
	himself a glass of Romulan ale.  The mood here seems to be 
	friendly; after all, these are two old comrades-in-arms who 
	haven't seen each other in a long time.  But underlying all 
	that is a definite tension... a feeling that there are issues 
	and frictions between the two of them that have yet to be 
	resolved and which may never be fully addressed.

					TAIN
			... you should've seen the look on 
			Legate Porania's face when I told 
			him I was going into retirement three 
			years ago.  He was literally 
			speechless -- a rare event.

					GARAK
				(smiles)
			I remember wanting to invent charges 
			of treason against him just so I 
			didn't have to hear his voice again.

					TAIN
			You would've done it, too, if I hadn't 
			held you back.  You had quite a 
			vicious streak in those days.

					GARAK
				(re: Tain)
			I learned from the best.

					TAIN
			No, no.  You had a gift.  I never 
			met anyone else who relished a good 
			interrogation as much as you did.  
			Do you remember getting that 
			confession out of Doctor Parmak?

					GARAK
				(smiles)
			I never even touched him.

					TAIN
			That was the beauty of it.  You just 
			sat there for -- what, three hours?

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         6A.

6    CONTINUED:

					GARAK
			Four.

					TAIN
			And after four hours of watching you 
			stare at him... he confessed.

					GARAK
			I was good, wasn't I?

					TAIN
			You were brilliant.  Afterwards, he 
			just kept saying...
				(shocked whisper)
			"His eyes... his eyes... "

	They both chuckle over the memory and then there's a quiet 
	beat.

					TAIN
			I missed you, Elim.  Things just 
			weren't the same after you left.

	Garak looks away... uncomfortable with the honest statement 
	of affection, but touched by it nonetheless.

					GARAK
			I... missed you too, Enabran.

	Tain breaks the moment by chuckling a little.

					TAIN
			We're both getting sentimental in 
			our old age... next thing you know, 
			we'll be crying over our lost youth.

	Garak also smiles with a little embarrassment.  He shifts 
	the conversation back to a safer topic.

					GARAK
			So whatever happened to Doctor Parmak?

					TAIN
			He spent three years in a labor camp, 
			then returned to Cardassia Prime.  I 
			think he's practicing medicine again.
				(beat, joking)
			When we get back, you should look 
			him up.

       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - ACT ONE      6B.

6    CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK
			There are a lot of people I intend 
			to look up when we get back.

					GARAK
				(beat)
			For instance, do you remember a Gul 
			named Dukat?

					TAIN
				(thinks)
			Dukat... ?

					GARAK
			He's the son of the late Justice 
			Procal.

					TAIN
			Oh, yes... the business with the 
			arms merchant.
				(beat)
			I take it, you'd like to have him 
			eliminated...

					GARAK
			The thought had crossed my mind.

					TAIN
			After this mission is completed, 
			you'll be in a position to... 
			eliminate anyone you want.

					GARAK
			I'll make a list and give it to Mila.

					TAIN
				(casual)
			You better give it to me personally.  
			Mila may not be around much longer.  
			She knows a great deal about me... 
			too much for her own good.

	Garak reacts slightly... this is a disturbing comment.  But 
	Garak has to be careful here -- he doesn't want to admit 
	that he actually cares about Mila lest Tain start to think 
	of him as being "soft." Garak sips his ale with practiced 
	nonchalance.

					GARAK
			Still... it would be a shame to have 
			her killed.  She's proven that she 
			can be trusted on numerous occasions.  
			And you'd be hard pressed to find a 
			better housekeeper.

					TAIN
			Is that a request I hear?

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE          7.

6    CONTINUED:	(3)

					GARAK
			Not at all.  Just an observation.

					TAIN
			There's no reason to pretend, Garak.  
			You're fond of Mila and you don't 
			want her hurt, right?

					GARAK
			If you're looking for an excuse to 
			spare the life of your own 
			housekeeper, you don't need me to 
			provide you with one.  You can do it 
			out of... the kindness of your heart.

	They look at each other for a long beat, each of them studying 
	the other and running their own internal evaluations of the 
	other's motive and intent.

					TAIN
				(quiet)
			Mila always believed you were innocent 
			of betraying Cardassia... and me.

	Something flickers across Garak's face at this comment... 
	some of the light bantering drops away from his tone.

					GARAK
			Really?  I'm surprised that alone 
			didn't earn her a place on your 
			execution rolls.

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE          8.

6    CONTINUED:	(4)

					TAIN
			It occurred to me.  But then I suppose 
			part of me wanted to believe you 
			were innocent too.

	Garak gives him a very direct look.

					GARAK
				(tight)
			I was.

					TAIN
				(not quite believing 
				it)
			Of course.

	Tain moves to take a drink from his glass.  He sniffs the 
	glass and puts it aside in distaste.

					TAIN
			No wonder the Romulans haven't 
			conquered the galaxy.  No one can 
			stomach their cuisine.

	Garak nods ruefully.  At that moment, a Romulan Colonel in 
	the Tal Shiar named LOVOK ENTERS the room.  Lovok is a male 
	Romulan in his late forties and has a clipped, no-nonsense 
	attitude about him.

					TAIN
			Ah.  Colonel Lovok.  Allow me to 
			introduce my associate, Elim Garak.

	Lovok glances over at Garak with little interest.

					LOVOK
				(to Tain, re: Garak)
			And what is his role to be in this 
			operation?

					TAIN
			He will do whatever I require of 
			him.  Elim is a cherished colleague 
			of long standing.

	Lovok gives Garak a direct look with the flat and lifeless 
	eyes of a shark.

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         8A.

6    CONTINUED:	(5)

					LOVOK

			You will not enter the bridge or any 
			other secured space aboard this ship 
			unescorted.  If you do so, you will 
			be killed.

					GARAK
			Direct isn't he?

					TAIN
			I'm afraid the Colonel believes in 
			wasting little time with pleasantries 
			or idle conversation.

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE          9.

6    CONTINUED:	(6)

	Lovok ignores Garak and speaks to Tain.

					LOVOK
			The fleet has recloaked and is about 
			to set course for the Founders' 
			homeworld at warp six.

					GARAK
			Warp six?  That's a bit slow isn't 
			it?  Something wrong with your 
			engines?

	Lovok ignores him, keeps talking to Tain.

					LOVOK
			If we travel any faster, our warp 
			signatures may be detected by the 
			Jem'Hadar... even through the cloaking 
			devices.

					GARAK
			Very clever.

					LOVOK
				(to Tain)
			The changeling is in quarters on "C" 
			deck.  There are forcefields in place 
			to prevent his escape.

					TAIN
			Good.
				(to Garak)
			Which brings us to your first 
			assignment, Garak.

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         10.

6    CONTINUED:	(7)

					TAIN
			I'd like you to explain to Odo that 
			it would be in everyone's best 
			interests -- especially his -- if he 
			were to provide us with all the 
			information he has on his people.

					GARAK
			That may prove to be difficult.  He 
			can be quite stubborn.

					TAIN
				(casual)
			Then you'll have to find a way of

	Tain says this without any hint of threat, but it hangs there 
	in the air, nonetheless.  Garak nods in understanding.

7    INT. ROMULAN QUARTERS

	ODO is looking around the sparsely furnished room with a 
	professional eye, looking for any means of escape, but not 
	really expecting to find any.  The door suddenly OPENS, 
	revealing Garak and a Romulan N.D. Guard standing in the 
	Corridor.  Garak's attitude is friendly as he ENTERS, but 
	Odo regards him coolly.

					GARAK
			Well, Odo... I trust the 
			accommodations meet with your 
			approval?

	Odo says nothing.

					GARAK
			You have to admit, this is certainly 
			better than a prison cell.

					ODO
			There are forcefields around the 
			bulkheads and a guard outside the 
			door.  Sounds like a prison cell to 
			me.

					GARAK
			I see your point.  And believe me, 
			if it were my decision, things would 
			be--

					ODO
			I don't believe you, Garak.  And I 
			doubt I'll believe much of what you 
			have to say from now on.  So save us 
			both some trouble and leave me alone.

					GARAK
			Why Constable, you seem positively 
			disappointed in me.

	Odo harumphs.

					GARAK
				(sarcastic)
			Well, I suppose it's understandable.  
			After all, I did pledge my undying 
			devotion and eternal allegiance to 
			both you and the Federation.  And 
			you and I've been through so much 
			together... shared so many 
			experiences... I know you considered 
			me a close friend.  No wonder you 
			feel betrayed.

					ODO
			You're wasting your time, Garak.  I 
			don't care about the rationalizations 
			you've come up with to justify your 
			actions.

					GARAK
			Justify?  I don't need to justify 
			anything to you.

					ODO
			Living on Deep Space Nine has made 
			you a little rusty... your lies are 
			becoming more transparent.  You should 
			be careful -- you don't want Tain to 
			know that you're feeling guilty about 
			what you've done.

					GARAK
			You are imaginative, Constable, I'll 
			grant you that.  But I suggest you 
			put those creative powers to better 
			use.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK (Cont'd)
			We would like you to share your... 
			unique insights on the Founders.

					ODO
			Would you?

					GARAK
			We would be most grateful for any 
			information you could provide.

					ODO
			And if I refuse...

					GARAK
			Really Odo, you must stop reading 
			those human crime novels that Chief 
			O'Brien gives you.  It's poisoning 
			your thinking.  I'm not here to 
			threaten you -- I just want to talk.

					ODO
			I don't feel like talking.

					GARAK
			Surely you can see that we have a 
			common enemy: the Founders.  By 
			cooperating, you'll be helping us 
			provide security for the entire Alpha 
			Quadrant.

					ODO
			The only common enemy you and I share 
			is Enabran Tain.  The difference 
			between you and I is that you don't 
			know it.

	The two men share a look for a long moment.

					GARAK
			I suggest you think over what I've 
			said, Constable.

					ODO
			That's funny... I was about to make 
			the same suggestion.

	Another beat, and then Garak EXITS.

9    INT. WARDROOM - ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	The large wall monitor is showing a recorded message by Tain 
	as Sisko, Kira, Dax, O'Brien, Bashir, and COMMANDER EDDINGTON 
	watch.

					TAIN
			... since the Jem'Hadar are 
			genetically addicted to a drug that 
			only the Founders can provide, we 
			expect the Jem'Hadar to weaken and 
			die once their supplies of the drug 
			run out -- a matter of days by our 
			estimates.  However that will give 
			them enough time to stage some kind 
			of counterattack against the Alpha 
			Quadrant so I suggest you place the 
			Cardassian fleet on alert.

	Worried looks go around the table as Tain pauses on the 
	viewer.

					TAIN
				(continuing)
			I take this action not in defiance 
			of the Cardassian state, but in 
			defense of it.  You in the Central 
			Command have neglected the security 
			of our people and allowed peace with 
			Bajor and the Federation to blind 
			you to the real threat: the Dominion.  
			I intend to remove that threat.  Let 
			history be my judge.

	The recording ENDS and is replaced by the symbol of the 
	Obsidian Order, and then by image of VICE ADMIRAL TODDMAN of 
	Starfleet Security.  Toddman is a man in his late fifties 
	and has a gruff, dour manner.

					TODDMAN
			That message was intercepted by a 
			Federation outpost earlier today.  A 
			similar message was sent to the 
			Romulan Senate.  Both governments 
			are denying any prior knowledge of 
			Tain's plan and are calling this a 
			rogue operation.

					BASHIR
			Are they going to do anything to 
			stop Tain?

	Toddman peers at Bashir for a moment, as if remembering

			that you were going to win the

			don't like to lose.

	Bashir is at something of a loss here... he has no idea what 
	to say.

					BASHIR
			I'm... sorry, admiral.

					TODDMAN
			Good.  Now to answer your question, 
			both the Romulans and the Cardassians 
			claim to be studying ways to stop 
			Tain.  But we believe that they're 
			going to sit back and wait to see if 
			he succeeds or not.

					DAX
			But sir, that could plunge both 
			Romulus and Cardassia into war with 
			the Dominion.

					TODDMAN
			Only if he fails, Lieutenant.  And 
			it looks like his plan has a fair 
			chance of success.  He's commanding 
			a fleet of twenty ships manned by 
			combat veterans.  They know the 
			location of the Founders' homeworld 
			and they've modified their cloaks so 
			the Jem'Hadar can't detect their 
			approach.

					KIRA
			You sound like you're hoping Tain 
			will succeed.

					TODDMAN
				(sharp)
			I never hope for war, Major.  But if 
			it comes... I'd rather see the 
			Dominion on the losing side.
				(takes a deep breath, 
				looks more grim)
			But we have to be prepared for the 
			worst.  Ben, I want you to evacuate 
			DS Nine of all non-essential personnel 
			and have the Defiant on standby 
			alert.  Even if Tain succeeds, the 
			Jem'Hadar are going to come screaming 
			out of the wormhole looking for

					SISKO
			I'd like permission to take the 
			Defiant into the Gamma Quadrant and 
			try to determine if he's still alive 
			and --

					TODDMAN
			The answer's no, Ben.  I'm sorry 
			about your officer, but there's 
			nothing we can do.  I want the Defiant 
			guarding Bajor.  That's your top

	The transmission ENDS.  There's a long quiet moment.

					SISKO
			Commander Eddington, am I correct in

					EDDINGTON
			Yes, sir.  A task force of nine

					SISKO
			Nine starships...
				(beat, then to all)
			I want the Defiant ready to leave

					EDDINGTON
			Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were

			At least three or four days, maybe

			Trouble?  You mean if you run into

			It's a possibility.

			Just... be careful, Lieutenant.  I'd

					DAX
				(touched)
			I always knew you were an old softy

			Well...

			Don't worry, your secret's safe with

			I appreciate that... Jadzia.  But

			Good.

	This is a different type of ship from the typical warbird --

	operation.  Garak, Lovok, and Tain are examining a tactical 
	map on one of the consoles.

					LOVOK
				(pointing to map)
			We know the Founders' planet lies at 
			approximately these coordinates within 
			the Omarion nebula.  As you can see, 
			there are no Jem'Hadar bases nearby.  
			That means that even if the Founders 
			do send out a distress call, it would

					TAIN
				(to Garak)
			Our plan is to wait until we've 
			entered orbit of the Founders' planet, 
			then decloak and begin a massive 
			bombardment.

					LOVOK
			Computer analysis indicates that the 
			planet's crust will be destroyed 
			within one hour, and the mantle within 
			five.

					GARAK
			That should more than take care of 
			the Founders...

					TAIN
			Yes, it should.  Unless they have 
			some planetary defenses we don't 
			know about.  And the only person 
			here who might know the answer to 
			that question is Mister Odo.

					GARAK
			Anything he knows about the Founders 
			and their planet was undoubtedly 
			included in his report to Starfleet.  
			The constable is remarkably thorough 
			in these matters.

	Tain frowns at Garak's evasion.

					TAIN
			There was a time when you were eager 
			to begin an interrogation, Elim.  In 
			fact, I remember having to restrain 
			your... enthusiasm on several 
			occasions.

					GARAK
			I do remember having a certain... 
			pride in my work.  But I doubt that 
			interrogating someone who can alter 
			their form at will is likely to 
			provide either amusement or 
			information.

18   CONTINUED:	(2)

					TAIN
			I wouldn't worry about Mister Odo's 
			shape-shifting if I were you.  The 
			Obsidian Order has developed a device 
			which should prove most effective in 
			neutralizing him.

					LOVOK
			I was not informed about this device.

					TAIN
			It's only a prototype... there's 
			never been a chance to test it... 
			before now.

	Tain studies Garak evenly for a moment.  Garak is lost in 
	thought... clearly disturbed by something.  Tain watches him 
	for a moment, then turns to Lovok.

					TAIN
				(to Lovok)
			Perhaps the Tal Shiar should take 
			over the interrogation of the 
			changeling.
				(off Garak's reaction)
			It's all right, Garak.  It's my fault.  
			I should've known that you'd develop 
			feelings for the people you lived 
			with for the past few years.
				(beat)
			I just never expected that you would 
			become friends with someone who worked 
			for the Bajorans.

					GARAK
			This has nothing to do with my 
			"friends" or my "feelings."  I simply 
			don't believe he has the information 
			you want.

					TAIN
			Possibly.  Colonel Lovok will find 
			out.

	Tain turns away, but Garak stops him.

			No.  I brought Odo here.  He's my

	Tain looks at him for a moment.

					TAIN
			You don't have to do this.

					GARAK
			Yes, I do.  And I think we both know 
			that you won't trust me until I do.

	A long beat.

			All right.  I look forward to hearing

					GARAK
			I realize it must be nearly time for 
			you to return to your liquid state.  
			So I thought I'd bring you something 
			to relax in.

					ODO
			How kind.

					GARAK
			But before you go for a swim, I have 
			a few questions I'd like to ask you.

					ODO
			I have nothing to say, Garak.

					GARAK
			I had hoped that a few hours alone 
			might jog your memory... but I can 
			see that I'm going to have to take 
			steps I had hoped to avoid.

					ODO
				(mock despair)
			Oh, no... you're going to torture 
			me, aren't you?  How I've dreaded 
			this moment.  Please have mercy, 
			Garak.

					GARAK
			You do have a certain... flair for 
			sarcasm.  It's one of the things I 
			like about you.

	Garak nods to one of the Romulan N.D.s, who activates a 
	control on the now assembled device, which lights up and 
	comes to life.

					GARAK
				(to N.D.)
			You can go now.

	The N.D.s EXIT.

					ODO
			I would bring the guard back in, if 
			I were you, Garak.  I'm not in a 
			very good mood.

        DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT THREE        29.

22   CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK
			Yes, under normal circumstances, you 
			would pose quite a threat to me.  
			You could turn yourself into a 
			Vicarian Razorback... or stretch out 
			your arms and strangle me from across 
			the room... but not this time.

					ODO
			Oh?  And why is that?

					GARAK
			Because that device is emitting a 
			quantum stasis field... designed to 
			prevent any changeling from altering 
			his biomolecular structure.

	Odo looks at him for a moment, wondering whether to believe 
	him or not... then he moves his arm and tries to change his 
	form.  Nothing happens.  Odo stretches and moves... but still 
	nothing happens.  A look of worry comes across his face.

					GARAK
			It must be very disconcerting for 
			you to be locked into a humanoid 
			form.  Especially now... you must 
			have been looking forward to returning 
			to your liquid state.
				(beat)
			Tell me... what will happen if you 
			can't revert to a liquid?

					ODO
			I don't know.

					GARAK
			An honest answer.  But it's probably 
			safe to say it won't be pleasant.

	Odo is getting concerned.  He looks at his hands a moment, 
	stretches his fingers, moves closer to Garak.

					ODO
			Garak, this is pointless.  There's 
			nothing I can tell you about the 
			Founders you don't already know.

    DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT THREE 30-31A.       

22   CONTINUED:	(3)

					GARAK
			I wish I could believe that.

					ODO
			Then why don't you?

					GARAK
			Because you and I are a lot alike.  
			We both value our privacy... our 
			inner secrets... that's why I know 
			there's something about the Founders 
			you haven't told anyone.  Something 
			you didn't want to share with 
			Starfleet or Commander Sisko.
				(beat)
			But you are going to tell me, Odo.

					ODO
				(hard)
			There's nothing to tell.

	Garak pulls up a chair and sits down.

					GARAK
			Maybe something will come to you.  I 
			can wait.  The question is, can you?

	OFF Odo's concerned face...

	Kira finally gets up and starts to head for the door.

					SISKO
			Major.  Leave the chief alone.

					KIRA
			What makes you think I was going to

	Sisko gives her a "who are you kidding" look and Kira relents.

			If he needed help he'd ask for it.  
			For now, the best thing we can do is 
			stay out of his way.

	Kira reluctantly sits back down.  Sisko lets out a long

	Garak sitting in the chair, watching Odo.  Odo's entire body 
	is desiccated -- it's as if all the moisture has been sucked 
	out of him, his face cracked, his skin flaking off... even 
	his "uniform" is cracked, the material falling to the deck.  
	We should feel as if Odo is about to collapse into a pile of 
	dust, and as the scene progresses his skin and uniform should 
	literally be falling apart.  Garak watches him with an even 
	but disturbed expression.  Odo has trouble speaking -- he's 
	in great pain.

					ODO
				(difficult)
			What's wrong, Garak... you don't 
			look very happy.  Aren't you enjoying 
			yourself?

					GARAK
			There's no pleasure in this for me 
			Constable, I assure you.  I'm simply 
			doing my job.

					ODO
			Your job... yes... this is the job 
			you've been waiting for.  All those 
			years of exile... and now here you 
			are... interrogating a prisoner again.  
			It must fill you with pride.

					GARAK
				(quiet)
			Odo... just tell me what I want to 
			know, and this will end.

	Odo stiffens, reacting to some internal spasm of agony.

					ODO
			But you don't want it to end, do 
			you, Garak?  You're enjoying it... 
			isn't this what you've been dreaming 
			about?  Back at work... serving 
			Cardassia...

			That's right.  And you have

			that it's my duty to extract from

				(trying to convince 
				himself)
			It's not personal.

	Odo spasms again, and Garak looks away.  We can tell that 
	this is hard on him -- he doesn't like what he's doing.  Odo 
	collapses onto the floor.  Instinctively, Garak leaps out of 
	his chair and moves to help him.  But he stops himself before 
	actually touching Odo.  He stares down in shock at the image 
	of the Constable... and then rages at him:

					GARAK
			Talk to me, Odo... tell me something -- 
			anything!  Lie if you have to!  But 
			say it -- now.
				(beat)
			Please.

	Odo lies there for a moment, trembling... finally, his voice 
	breaking, Odo makes a whispered confession.

					ODO
			Home... I want to go home...

	Garak kneels next to him.

					GARAK
			And you will.  I promise.  When this 
			is all over, I promise I'll take you 
			back to Deep Space Nine.

					ODO
			No... not the station... home... 
			with my people...

	Garak looks at him in surprise.

					ODO
			I did... but they're still my

			to forget... but I can't...
				(beat)
			I'm one of them... and I want to be 
			with them... in the Great Link.

	Garak looks at him for a moment... he's accomplished what he 
	had to do, but now he wishes he hadn't.

					GARAK
			I knew there was something... 
			something you were holding back...

	Odo is on the verge of losing consciousness.

					ODO
			And now you've found it... I hope 
			it's useful...

	Garak looks at him for a long moment... finally stands up, 
	moves to the device and deactivates it... He turns away from 
	Odo, giving him a moment of privacy.  Behind Garak, we 
	suddenly see Odo MORPHING into a liquid and then streaming 
	into the bucket.  Garak sits down in the chair, takes a deep 
	breath... then puts his head in his hand and closes his eyes 
	in a mixture of relief and guilt...

			Nothing.  He never broke.

			Terminate him.

	Garak thinks quickly, but he has to appear casual, as if 
	only trying to help Tain.

					GARAK
			On the other hand, Odo is a member

			Why were you trying to protect the

					GARAK

			I wasn't trying to protect him.  And 
			as I recall, you thought it was a 
			good idea to keep him alive, as well.

	Lovok studies his face for a moment.

					LOVOK
			My interest in the changeling is 
			based on what I believe to be the 
			strategic interests of the Romulan 
			Empire.  But you... you seem to have

					GARAK
			Tell me -- what else am I feeling?  
			I've never been psychoanalyzed by a 
			Romulan before.  This is a fascinating 
			experience.

					LOVOK
			You are a practiced liar, Mister

	Corridor, on their way to deal with some emergency.  As they 
	race down the Corridor, we see Garak waiting around the 
	corner, watching the Guard.  The Guard is momentarily 
	distracted by the other Romulans running down the Corridor 
	and that's when Garak makes his move -- he rushes up behind 
	the Guard and quickly dispatches him with a few well placed 
	blows.  He then grabs the Guard's disruptor and OPENS the 
	door to...

40   INT. ROMULAN QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

			No, it's not.  I suggest we make our

					ODO
			For once, Garak, I agree with you.

	They both turn and head for the doorway, only to find it 
	blocked by Lovok, who is standing there with a disruptor in 
	his hand.  He has them both covered and they have no chance.  
	Odo and Garak are surprised as Lovok steps forward and hands 
	them a PADD.

			You will need this in order to gain

					ODO
			Why are you doing this?

	Lovok looks him straight in the eye, and as he does so, his 
	entire demeanor seems to change -- no longer the Romulan 
	Colonel, but now the ethereal superior attitude of a Founder.  
	His speech is slower, more assured.

					LOVOK
			Because no changeling has ever harmed 
			another.

	Garak and Odo are stunned as they realize that Lovok is a 
	changeling.

					GARAK
			You... are one of the Founders?

					ODO
			Of course... this whole plan was the 
			Founders' idea in the first place.  
			You wanted the Tal Shiar and the 
			Obsidian Order to combine forces and 
			come into the Gamma Quadrant so you 
			could wipe them out.

					LOVOK
			Not exactly.  Tain originated the 
			plan.  But when we learned of it, we 
			did everything we could to carry it 
			forward.  The Tal Shiar and the 
			Obsidian Order are both ruthless, 
			efficient organizations -- a definite 
			threat to us.

					ODO
			But not after today.

					LOVOK
			After today the only real threats to 
			us from the Alpha Quadrant are the 
			Klingons and the Federation.  And I 
			doubt either of them will be a threat 
			for much longer.

	The ship is ROCKED again, the lights go down even LOWER.

			It is not too late for you, Odo.  
			Come with me.  You can still become

					ODO
			Thank you.  But my answer is still 
			no.

	Lovok nods in acknowledgement, then steps back and 
	DEMATERIALIZES.  The ship is ROCKED again.

					ODO
			Come on.  I don't think we have much 
			time.

	They EXIT to the Corridor.

	Garak and Odo ENTER from the Quarters.  The ship is still

			The runabout is that way, two decks 
			down in Section Twenty-five.  I'll

					ODO
			Where are you going?

					GARAK
			To the Bridge... to get Tain.

	Odo can't believe what he's hearing.

					ODO
			What?!

					GARAK
			I know it's hard for you to 
			understand, Constable... but I still 
			owe him a personal debt... and I 
			have to try and repay it.  Wait for

					GARAK
			Tain!  We have to go.

	Tain looks up at him calmly, oblivious to the destruction 
	around him or the dire circumstances.

					TAIN
			There must have been an informant.  
			It's the only explanation.

					GARAK
			You're right.  There was an informant -- 
			Colonel Lovok is a changeling.

	Tain sits back as if physically assaulted.  There's a new 
	expression on his face -- defeat.

					TAIN
			Lovok...

					GARAK
			Yes.  But we can discuss it at a 
			later time.  Right now I think --

					TAIN
				(interrupting)
			It appears I underestimated the 
			Founders.  I should have seen it 
			coming.  There was a time when nothing 
			got past me.  You remember, don't 
			you, Elim?

	The ship is ROCKED hard... there's another EXPLOSION on the 
	Bridge.  Garak grabs him by the shoulders, tries to get his 
	attention.

					GARAK
			Yes, I do.  But now, we have to go!

					TAIN
			Go where?  Back to Mila and my... 
			quiet retirement?  I don't think so.

					TAIN
				(smiles to himself)
			I must be getting old... I let my 
			pride override my instincts... 
			wouldn't have played it that way in 
			the old days... in the old days I 
			would've kept Lovok at arms length... 
			he was too cagey... too smart...

	Garak begins to realize that he's not going to get Tain out 
	of that chair, but he won't leave without him.

					GARAK
			I can't just leave you here.

					TAIN
			I always did have a soft spot for 
			you, Garak... another of my flaws...

	Garak is about to make another plea, when suddenly Odo's 
	hand HITS Garak hard from o.c. and KNOCKS HIM OUT.  Garak 
	crumples to the deck.  Tain barely takes note of this.

					TAIN
			... these Founders, Elim... they're 
			very good... next time we'll have to 
			be more careful...

	Odo ignores Tain and starts to pick up the unconscious form 
	of Garak.

44   INT. RUNABOUT

	Odo in the pilot seat, Garak is now conscious in the other 
	seat and rubbing what is now a large bruise on his head 
	ruefully.

					GARAK
			You can be very persuasive on 
			occasion, Constable.  But you might 
			consider using... gentler language 
			in the future.

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT FIVE        49.

					ODO
				(working console)
			I'll keep that in mind.
				(beat)
			A Jem'Hadar ship is following us.  
			Raise shields and charge the weapons.

	Garak shakes off his grogginess and goes to work.  The ship 
	is suddenly ROCKED HARD.

					GARAK
			Aft shields down to fifty percent.  
			More speed would be advisable.

					ODO
			The warp drive is off-line.

	The ship is ROCKED again.  And then AGAIN.  A console EXPLODES 
	behind them.

					GARAK
			Shields down to thirty percent.

					ODO
			Another Jem'Hadar ship approaching 
			to starboard.  Hang on!

	Odo works the console and the ship BANKS HARD to the LEFT.

					GARAK
			Shields down to fifteen percent.

	The ship is ROCKED and the lights go DIM.

					ODO
			Main power's failing.  We're losing 
			speed.

	The ship is ROCKED and all the lights go OUT.

					GARAK
			The shields are gone.

      DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - ACT FIVE      50.

44   CONTINUED:	(2)

	There's a beat as they both realize that they're dead.  
	Garak looks over at Odo.

					GARAK
			Odo... I hope that you'll accept my 
			sincere apologies for all this.

					ODO
			A little late isn't it?

					GARAK
			Nevertheless...

	There's a beat, and then Odo nods his forgiveness.

					ODO
			I may not agree with what you did, 
			but I... can certainly understand 
			your... desire to return home.

					GARAK
				(smiles)
			Thank you.

	Odo looks out the window and reacts in shock at what he sees.

					ODO
			What... ?

47   ANGLE ON WINDOW (OPTICAL)

	Through the window of the runabout, we can suddenly see the 
	DEFIANT DECLOAK directly ahead of us and roar overhead.

47A  EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)

	The Defiant passes the runabout and FIRES on the pursuing 
	Jem'Hadar ships, DESTROYING THEM BOTH.

48   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Sisko, Eddington, Kira, and Dax at their stations.  The ship 
	is at RED ALERT and the mood is tense and urgent.

					SISKO
			Fire on the lead ship, then bring us

	Kira works and on the viewscreen, we can see the lead

	DESTROYED.

					DAX
			Two life-signs on the runabout,

			Aye, sir.

			O'Brien to Bridge.  I've got them.

					SISKO
			Raise shields.

48A  INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM

	O'Brien at the console, Bashir standing nearby with a medkit 
	as Odo and Garak step off the stage.

					O'BRIEN
			Welcome back.

					ODO
			Thank you.

	Bashir sees the bruise on Garak's head.

					BASHIR
			That looks painful.

					GARAK
			It is.
				(glances at Odo)
			But it did save my life.

	The ship is ROCKED...

	As the ship continues to ROCK.

				(to Dax)
			Attack pattern omega four.  Full 
			impulse power.
				(to Kira)
			Hold your fire until we're within 
			five hundred meters.

					KIRA
			We might get pretty singed at that 
			range.

					SISKO
			Not as singed as they're going to 
			get.  Engage.

49   EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)

	The ship roars directly into the teeth of INTENSE FIRE from 
	the THREE JEM'HADAR SHIPS.

      DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - ACT FIVE     51A.

49A  INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Phaser fire from the Jem'Hadar ships fills the screen as

	The ship twists and rolls to avoid the Jem'Hadar fire.

			Two thousand meters...

	On the viewscreen, the Defiant closes in on the three 
	Jem'Hadar ships.

			Fire!

49D  EXT. SPACE - DEFIANT & JEM'HADAR SHIPS (OPTICAL)

	The Defiant almost runs into the three Jem'Hadar ships before 
	opening fire.  The first ship is hit and banks away... the 
	second and third ships are destroyed.

50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	As before.  Odo and Garak ENTER the Bridge along with Bashir 
	and O'Brien.  The ship is ROCKED again.

					KIRA
			The third Jem'Hadar fighter is still 
			pursuing.

					SISKO
			Aft torpedoes.  Fire.

	Kira watches her console.

         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT FIVE        52.

					KIRA
			Direct hit on their port nacelle.  
			They're losing speed... we're out of 

			their weapons' range.

					SISKO
			Any other signs of pursuit?

					DAX
			Negative.  The other fighters are 
			still concentrating on the remaining 
			Romulan and Cardassian ships.

					SISKO
			Let's not wait around for them to 
			change their minds.  Set course for 
			the wormhole, Lieutenant.  Warp eight.

	Dax works her console as Kira moves to Odo.

					KIRA
			It's... good to see you again, 
			Constable.

					ODO
			Likewise... major.

			Engage.

51A  INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	Sisko is standing in front of his monitor, talking to Admiral 
	Toddman.

					SISKO
			There's still no indication that any 
			Romulan or Cardassian vessels survived 
			the attack.

					TODDMAN
				(shakes his head)
			Sounds like Wolf Three-Five-Nine all 
			over again.

					SISKO
				(grim)
			I had the same thought.

	Toddman nods, then moves on to other business.

					TODDMAN
			You may be interested to know, I've 
			decided not to file charges against 
			anyone on the Defiant.

					SISKO
			Thank you, sir.

					TODDMAN
				(tough)
			But if you pull a stunt like that 
			again, I'll court martial you... or 
			promote you.  Either way, you'll be 
			in a lot of trouble.

	A beat, and we can see just a hint of amusement in Toddman's 
	gruff exterior.

					SISKO
			I'll keep that in mind.  Sir.

	Toddman nods and then reaches over and touches a control,

52   INT. GARAK'S SHOP

	The shop is still ruined from the explosion.  Nothing has 
	been repaired or cleaned up.  Garak is poking about in the 
	rubble, contemplating the destruction.  After a beat, he 
	turns and finds Odo standing in the doorway, watching him.  
	Odo eyes him evenly, and says without preamble...

					ODO
			I read the report you wrote... and I 
			wanted to thank you.

					GARAK
				(surprised)
			Me?  For what?

					ODO
			For not mentioning my... desire to 
			return to my people.

					GARAK
			I consider the entire conversation 
			as... something best forgotten.

					ODO
			As do I.

	There's a beat and then Odo takes a few steps in the wreckage.

					ODO
				(continuing)
			Quark has expressed an interest in 
			renting this space if you're not 
			going to be using it.

					GARAK
			Oh?

      DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/16/95 - ACT FIVE      54.

52   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			He mentioned something about an 
			Argelian massage facility.

					GARAK
			Unfortunately, I don't think Commander 
			Sisko will approve of such an... 
			interesting facility on the Promenade.

					ODO
			I tend to agree.  But I think he 
			would approve of... a tailor's shop.

	There's a quiet beat as Garak looks over the ruins.

					GARAK
			You know what the sad part is, Odo... 
			I'm a pretty good tailor.

	Odo nods and then heads for the door.  He pauses on the 
	threshold.

					ODO
			Garak... I was thinking that... we 
			should have breakfast together... 
			sometime.

					GARAK
				(surprised)
			Why, Constable... I thought you didn't 
			eat.

					ODO
			I don't.

	There's a quiet moment and then Garak nods his head in 
	acknowledgment of Odo's unspoken invitation for something 
	that might be akin to friendship and Odo nods back.  Odo 
	EXITS, leaving Garak alone to contemplate his future.

									FADE OUT.

			Take me home, Smiley.
