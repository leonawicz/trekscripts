1    EXT. S.F. STREET - CLOSE ON CLEMENS

					CLEMENS
			I have long been interested in
			the notion of time travel. In
			fact, I wrote a book about it...
			It chronicled the tale of a man
			from our era who fouled the sixth
			century by introducing newfangled
			gadgets and weapons... all in the
			name of Progress.
				(puffs cigar)
			The idea of time travelers isn't
			so far fetched as it seems...
			in fact, I have learned that, even
			now, people from the future are
			right here in San Francisco...
			and I have no doubt that they are
			intent on fouling our world...
			just like my Yankee did in King
			Arthur's time.
				(leans into camera)
			Well. Let me serve notice: as
			soon as I get the necessary
			evidence, I intend to expose
			them... and make it absolutely
			clear that they are not welcome
			here.

2    ANGLE - CLEMENS AND YOUNG REPORTER

	revealing that Clemens has been giving an on-the-street
	interview to a young reporter who is taking notes on
	a pad. The kid smiles politely.

   STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/08/92 - TEASER   2.

2    CONTINUED:

					YOUNG REPORTER
			Yes, sir. And will this be a
			sequel to "Connecticut Yankee,"
			Mister Twain?

					CLEMENS
				(glaring)
			The name's Clemens, son. Sam
			Clemens, with an "e."

					YOUNG REPOTER
				(jotting it down)
			With an "e"... got it.

	Suddenly Twain stops, spotting something across the
	street.

					CLEMENS
			'Scuse me.

	Twain hurries away, falling in behind DATA, following
	him down the street -- still seeking "necessary evidence."
	Camera DROPS OFF on a TALL, ARISTOCRATIC COUPLE moving
	the opposite direction... she carries a satchel, he
	carries a cane with a strange carved snake-head. They
	take no notice of Data. Camera follows them as they
	move through the people on the street in a silent,
	ominous search.

4    INT. MORGUE - DARKENED ROOM

	Only the vague shapes of drape-covered bodies are
	visible... a hand-held light (lantern?) casts a light.
	Beverly is using a tricorder on the bodies.

					RIKER
			The coroner said this room
			contained all the cholera
			victims...

					BEVERLY
			It doesn't make sense that so many
			people are dying of cholera --
			it just isn't that virulent.

	Suddenly she stops at one body.

					BEVERLY
			Wil... this is strange...

					RIKER
			What is it?

					BEVERLY
			The cerebral cortex... the
			cerebellum... the brain stem...
			the entire nervous system -- has
			been drained of electrochemical
			energy.
				(moving to another body)
			Here's another one... same neural
			depletion...

   STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/15/92 - ACT ONE   4.

4    CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			These people didn't die of cholera
			-- they died because their neural
			energy was drained somehow.

					RIKER
			Drained... and taken to Devidia
			Two... for those aliens to
			ingest.

	Beverly gives him a look... this is an appalling
	scenario. Riker looks around the gloomy room, the
	rows of shrouded bodies.

   STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT ONE   5.

4    CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			If you were a time-traveller with
			a taste for human neural energy...
			how would you get your supply?

	She eyes him, understanding what he's getting at.

					BEVERLY
			I'd travel back to times when
			there were plagues and
			epidemics... when I could murder
			-- and use disease as a cover.

5    EXT. VICTORIAN BOARDING HOUSE - DAY - STOCK

	Establishing.

6    INT. BOARDING HOUSE - RENTED ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Riker and Beverly are there, reporting to Picard, Troi,
	and Geordi. All are dressed in 19th century garb.

					BEVERLY
			Over half the victims who'd been
			drained of neural energy came from
			a place called Sisters of Hope
			Infirmary.

					RIKER
			It's a charity hospital near the
			waterfront.

					TROI
			If the aliens have been killing
			people there, someone might have
			noticed something unusual...

					PICARD
			If they're moving among humans,
			they must have taken human form.
			The question is, how do we know
			who we're looking for... ?

   STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT ONE   6.

6    CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			The tricorder picked up evidence
			of triolic activity in most of
			the bodies we looked at. If the
			aliens are leaving that signature
			behind, they'll be detectable.

					GEORDI
				(thinks for a moment)
			We might even be able to set
			up some kind of alien alarm
			system.

	They move to collect their things (purses, jackets,
	etc.); Riker goes to Geordi.

					RIKER
			Any luck contacting Data?

					GEORDI
			None. The tricorder is
			broadcasting random emissions...
			but the range is pretty limited.
			Almost anything could interfere...

	Riker nods, and they start toward the door, when
	suddenly there's a loud, insistent knocking on the
	door. The group exchanges dismayed glances.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE    7.

6    CONTINUED: (2)

					GEORDI
			She's back.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL'S VOICE
			Mister Picard!

	She pronounces it PICK-erd. The others regard the
	Captain, who rises. Geordi removes his VISOR, puts on
	dark glasses.

					PICARD
				(resigned)
			Coming, Mrs. Carmichael...

	He opens the door to find MRS. CARMICHAEL standing
	there. She is a short, squat, formidable-looking
	woman, Irish and insistent. She speaks with a thick
	brogue.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			Mister Picard... I'd be remindin'
			you that it's one o'clock.

					PICARD
			Yes... ?

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			One o'clock of a Thursday.

	Picard smiles aimiably at her, not sure what she's
	getting at.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			I'm sure I made it clear to you
			that the rent is always due,
			payable in full, by one o'clock
			on Wednesdays.

					PICARD
			Ah. The... rent.

	He turns toward the group; they are at a loss. This
	is, after all, such a foreign concept to them. Picard
	turns back.

   STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT ONE   8.

6    CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			Mrs. Carmichael, my troupe is even
			now in rehearsals for a new
			production.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			Oh? I haven't heard of any new
			production. What play is it?

					PICARD
			It's -- "A Midsummer Night's
			Dream."

	She starts to speak but he cuts her off.

					PICARD
			We've performed in London...
			Paris... Milan... all to sold
			out houses. I assure you, we'll
			be able to pay the rent... with
			a bonus.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
				(shaking her head)
			No, no, no... I've heard you
			silver-tongued devils before...

	She advances on Picard, eyes blazing with
	determination.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE    8A.

6    CONTINUED: (4)

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			I'll have the rent in full...
			tomorrow... by one o'clock -- or
			you'll be performing on the
			street.

	She whirls and marches to the door, slamming it. The
	others share reactions. They've bought a little time
	-- but how will they come up with the rent?

7    INT. DATA'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME DAY (OPTICAL)

	The door opens admitting Clemens (without a lit cigar)
	and JACK THE BELLBOY.

					JACK
			I wouldn't do this for just
			anybody, Mister Clemens. And I
			hope you won't spread it around
			that I let you in...

					CLEMENS
			Of course not, Jack. And I assure
			you -- Mister Data would be most
			upset if you didn't.
					(MORE)

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE    9.

7    CONTINUED:

					CLEMENS (Cont'd)
			If I don't find that Letter of
			Intent he left for me... our major
			investor is going to pull out and
			take his business elsewhere.

					JACK
				(knowing)
			It has to do with Mister Data's
			engine, doesn't it?

					CLEMENS
			Engine...

	Jack gestures to the contraption which Data has
	constructed, now working. Clemens, intrigued, walks
	toward it.

					CLEMENS
			Yes... yes... this is exactly what
			it's all about...

	He circles around the device; Jack launches into
	another subject.

					JACK
			Mister Clemens... I'm gonna do
			you another favor today...

					CLEMENS
				(still looking at
				 device)
			Mmmmmm...

					JACK
			You're always looking for good
			stories, right?
				(no response)
			Well, I've got a humdinger.

					CLEMENS
			Uh-huh...

					JACK
			The story of -- my life. Now,
			I know you might think I'm
			young... but I've covered a lot
			of ground, and if I do say so,
			it'd make for some pretty
			fascinating reading.
				(beat)
			So. What do you think?

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE    9A.

7    CONTINUED: (2)

					CLEMENS
				(looking up)
			About what?

					JACK
			About writing my life story. You
			and me -- literary partners.

	Clemens takes his arm, moves him toward the door,
	feigning interest in order to get him out of there.

					CLEMENS
			You know, son, there's a maxim
			I've always lived by: no one's
			more qualified to write your story
			than you are.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE    10.

7    CONTINUED: (3)

					JACK
			Me? Be a writer? You think I
			could?

					CLEMENS
			Long as you write what you know...
			you got any passions, son? Any
			dreams?

					JACK
			I'd like to do some travelling...
			maybe go to sea... and Alaska.
			I've always had a notion to see
			Alaska.

	Clemens is moving him toward the door, feigning
	interest in order to get him out of there.

					CLEMENS
			That's a great idea. If I were
			your age, that's exactly what I'd
			do... Alaska -- the Klondike...
			the Aurora Borealis... that's it,
			follow your dreams. And write
			about them.

	He opens the door, gesturing the young man out.

					JACK
			Thank you! Thank you, Mister
			Clemens. That's just what I'm
			going to do!

					CLEMENS
				(trying to get him out)
			You do that, son --

					JACK
			You'll be seeing my name in print.
				(gesturing)
			London... the name's London.

					CLEMENS
			I'm sure I will. Good-bye now.

	And he finally gets the kid out. Clemens returns
	immediately to the device, now begins to examine it
	in earnest. Finally he leans toward it and removes
	the transceiver assembly. The machine stops
	functioning. He slips it in his pocket -- when he
	hears the sound of muffled voices in the hall. He
	heads for the armoire.

     STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE 11-12.       

7    CONTINUED: (4)

	He reaches it as a key is heard in the lock, and is
	safely behind it when the door opens, admitting Data
	and GUINAN.

					GUINAN
			... so when I finally got to the
			Head Surveyor... I found the
			location of your cavern. But
			you won't be able to get to it.

					DATA
			Why is that?

					GUINAN
			The only entrance is a mine
			shaft... right in the middle of
			the Presidio... the Army Fort.

					DATA
			Perhaps you could arrange for us
			to get in.

	She stares at him.

					GUINAN
			What?

					DATA
			With permission to dig for the
			mine shaft.

					GUINAN
			Data... so far I've been able to
			do everything you asked me to.
			But do you really expect me to
			get you into a high-security
			military installation?

	He moves toward the mechanism he has created.

					DATA
				(mildly)
			I have full confidence in your
			persuasive abilities.

					GUINAN
			Well... this is more interesting
			than giving tea dances.

	Data realizes the mechanism isn't working.

					DATA
			That is strange...

					GUINAN
			What?

  STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/06/92 - ACT ONE  13.

7    CONTINUED: (5)

					DATA
			I left this device activated...
			but the transceiver assembly has
			been removed... without it I will
			be unable to track the time
			shifts.

					GUINAN
				(immediately)
			Clemens.

					DATA
			Samuel Clemens?

					GUINAN
			He's been driving me crazy. He
			watches the house, follows me down
			the street asking questions --
			I'd bet you anything he got in
			here and took your -- whatever
			you said.

					DATA
			If you are correct, he must be
			told that the device has been
			modified in such a way that
			prolonged contact with human
			tissue would be highly toxic.

	There is a muffled "thump" from the closet. Data and
	Guinan exchange glances. Data moves swiftly to the
	closet door and flings it open. Clemens stands there,
	at once sheepish and defiant, as Data and Guinan stare
	at him.

                                             FADE OUT.

8    INT. DATA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The transceiver assembly lies on the floor. Data

	usual savoir faire.

					CLEMENS
			Madame Guinan... Mister Data...
			good day.

					GUINAN
			Mister Clemens... shame on you.

					CLEMENS
			Shame, madame? I think not. I
			find no shame in my efforts to
			uncover your plot.

					GUINAN
			I keep telling you, there is no
			plot --

					CLEMENS
			Yes... you do keep telling me
			that.
				(a beat, as he regards
				 her)
			Mister Data, did you know that
			Madame Guinan here is from a
			renowned Boston family... a close
			relative of Judge Truman Williams?
				(to Guinan)
			I believe that's what you said...

					GUINAN
			Yes.

					CLEMENS
			Then... I wonder... why the Judge
			says he's never heard of you?
			That's what his telegram to me
			indicated...

					GUINAN
				(unfazed)
			There's been a blood feud between
			two branches of the family. He
			doesn't acknowledge me.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    15.

8    CONTINUED:

					CLEMENS
			Ah. That must wound you deeply.

	He circles the room, eyeing Data and Guinan up and
	down.

					CLEMENS
			What an interesting pair you
			are... an Ashanti princess...
			and a Swiss. Where in Switzerland
			are you from, Mister Data?

					DATA
			I am French, not Swiss.

					CLEMENS
			Of course, that's right... now
			I remember. A Frenchman with
			a talent for poker, from what I
			hear.
				(paces again)
			You know, I was talking with a
			friend of mine, Ches Whitley...
			he said to say hello... wonders
			when you're coming back.

					DATA
			I do not believe I know Mister
			Whitley.

					CLEMENS
			No? He works at the County
			Assayer's Office... said you've
			been in there several times...
			claiming to be a geological
			engineer. Wanting information
			about mining operations during
			the 1850's...
				(beat)
			Remember him now?

					DATA
			I do not know the gentleman by
			name. I have spoken to several
			people in that office.

					CLEMENS
			Yes... I know. And in the Hall
			of Records... and the Geological
			Society... and a little-known
			mineral shop in Chinatown. You
			do get around, don't you?

    STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/06/92 - ACT TWO 16-17.      

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			As apparently you do, Mister
			Clemens.

					CLEMENS
				(chuckling)
			I must admit -- you've got me
			mystified.

	He moves toward Data's machine.

					CLEMENS
			This contraption, for instance.
			Very unusual. It looks quite --
			futuristic. Tell me -- might
			it have something to do with
			"time shifts"?

					DATA
			In a sense. The time shift is
			a new gearing system that I have
			invented... for a horseless
			carriage.

	Clemens glares at both of them, fed up with cat and
	mouse.

					CLEMENS
			Do not insult me.
				(moving to Data)
			You've come to this century and
			brought your infernal technology
			with you... for God only knows
			what purpose... but I have no
			doubt that it will be the people
			of this century who will suffer
			for it.

					GUINAN
			Mister Clemens, I think we've had
			quite enough of this. Mister
			Data's business is his own, and
			I'd thank you to leave.

8    CONTINUED: (3)

					CLEMENS
			Pardon me, Madame, but it is
			my business... it is the business
			of all humanity, I believe, to
			stop both of you from whatever
			it is you are doing here. And
			that is what I intend to do.

	And he's out the door, leaving Data and Guinan relieved
	that he's gone, but mindful that he could be a lot of
	trouble before this is over.

	Beverly, dressed as a nurse, wearing wire-rimmed
	glasses, is following DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE as he makes
	rounds. He seems to be a kindly doctor, but underneath
	lie the typical assumptions of 19th century sexism and
	racism. In the bg, Troi and Geordi (with dark glasses),
	are passing out little parcels to patients, chatting
	with them as they do. Geordi is carrying the tray of
	parcels.

	Doctor Apollinaire lifts the wrist of one moribund
	man, feels for a pulse.

  STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT TWO  19.

10   CONTINUED:

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			He won't last the day.

					BEVERLY
			Aren't we going to treat him?

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			I wish we could. But at this
			point there's nothing to be done.
			Unless you know of some miracle
			treatment.

	Beverly moves toward a medicine tray, picks up a
	vial.

					BEVERLY
			Why don't we try an alkaline
			saline solution... to counteract
			dehydration?

	Apollinaire gives her a disdainful look.

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			Nurse, if that were helpful,
			don't you think I would have
			ordered it?

	Beverly has to bite her tongue.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    20.

10   CONTINUED: (2)

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			Now, you finish the charts and
			leave the practice of medicine
			to me.

					BEVERLY
			Yes, Doctor.

	He moves to one end of the ward; Beverly moves toward
	Troi and Geordi, who are talking with a MALE PATIENT.
	Beverly slips her tricorder out of a pocket, and, as
	she studies a chart, surreptitiously scans the area.

10A  ON GEORDI AND TROI

					TROI
			... did your friend have any
			visitors before he died?

					MALE PATIENT
				(weakly)
			No... had no family... only people
			to come were doctor and nurse.

	Troi nods, pat his arm comfortingly and starts to move
	on.

					MALE PATIENT
			Very bad doctor.

	She turns back.

					MALE PATIENT
			Only spent time with one man.
			I ask for water... he ignore me.
			Others cry in pain... doctor does
			not care.
				(shakes his head)
			Very bad.

	Troi exchanges a glance with Geordi.

  STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT TWO  21.

11   EXT. INFIRMARY STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Riker continues his patrol as Picard approaches. He
	is dressed as a workman and carries a tool box.

					PICARD
			Hello, Officer. This the
			Infirmary?

					RIKER
			Yes. The entrance is right there.

	Riker watches as Picard moves toward the entrance.
	From behind him approach a tall, aristocratic couple, a
	DOCTOR and NURSE. The nurse carries a satchel; the
	doctor carries a cane... carved with a snake's head...
	as they pass Riker, he tips his hat to them. They move
	toward the entrance of the infirmary.

12   INT. INFIRMARY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	Picard is fiddling with one of the gas lamps on the
	wall. Glancing around to make sure no one is watching,
	he inserts a small (TECH DEVICE) inside the lamp, then
	begins to replace the fixture. Doctor Apollinaire
	approaches.

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			Just what is it you're doing with
			those lamps?

					PICARD
			Replacing the wick screws. City
			ordinance... makes it safer in
			case of an earthquake.

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			There hasn't been an earthquake
			here in thirty years.

  STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT TWO  22.

12   CONTINUED:

	He finishes the lamp, picks up a tool box.

					PICARD
			That's it for this ward. Have
			to be moving on.

	He goes toward the door as Apollinaire looks after him,
	shaking his head scornfully.

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			Earthquakes...
				(to Beverly)
			Nurse, if you can handle things
			here, I have a meeting with the
			Board of Patrons.

					BEVERLY
			I'm sure I'll manage.

	He EXITS. Beverly takes out her tricorder and
	continues scanning. She moves toward Troi and Geordi,
	who has now put on his VISOR and is looking around the
	room.

					GEORDI
				(pointing)
			There... by that bed. I can see
			an afterimage of triolic waves.
			They were here recently... within
			the last twenty-four hours.

					BEVERLY
				(noting the bed)
			That's the bed where someone died
			last night...

					TROI
				(pointing to the male
				 patient)
			This man was complaining about
			a strange doctor and nurse who
			visited that patient.
				(to Geordi)
			They might still be in the
			hospital.

	Beverly nods and Troi and Geordi EXIT. Beverly
	continues scanning... when suddenly one of the patients
	goes into labored breathing. She is at his side in a
	moment... checks pulse and pupils.

   STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO   22A.

12   CONTINUED: (2)

	She turns quickly to a medicine cart nearby, and
	quickly mixes two vials together, returns to the bed
	and tilts the man's head up so he can sip.

					BEVERLY
			This will make you more
			comfortable...

	The man swallows, falls back on the pillow. Beverly
	begins to sponge his brow.

13   ANGLE - ON DOOR

	as it opens and the tall, silent Alien Doctor and Nurse
	ENTER the ward. Beverly is working with the man at
	the other end of the room, her back toward them. The
	couple moves quickly to the bedside of a patient.

13A  ON THE GAS LAMP

	As a tiny red light begins to blink.

14   BEVERLY

	ministers to her patient... then hears the muffled
	sound of her tricorder. She looks up toward the gas
	lamp and sees --

14A  ON THE GAS LAMP

	the tiny red light blinking.

14B  BEVERLY

	looks toward the doctor and nurse.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    23.

15   ON DOCTOR AND NURSE

	Their backs are toward her, blocking what they're
	doing.

16   BEVERLY

	pulls her communicator from a pocket and touches it,
	then stands and approaches the Alien Doctor and Nurse.

17   ANGLE - DOCTOR AND NURSE

					BEVERLY
			Do you need any help, Doctor?

17AA	INSERT - SATCHEL

	Unseen by Beverly, the Alien Nurse puts both hands
	on the satchel...

17AB	ON BEVERLY

	She takes the chart from the foot of the bed.

					BEVERLY
				(stalling)
			Doctor Apollinaire felt he had
			entered the algid stage... he was
			cyanotic, pulse unobservable...

17AC	INSERT - SATCHEL

	The Alien Nurse is slowly lifting the satchel.

17AD	ON BEVERLY

	She glances up, and spots the --

17A  SNAKE'S HEAD CANE

17B  BACK TO SCENE

					BEVERLY
			That's an interesting cane...

   STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO   23A.

17B  CONTINUED:

	The Alien Nurse lifts the satchel and points it right
	toward Beverly, who doesn't know exactly what it will
	do, but can guess. Riker comes plunging through the
	door, phaser drawn.

					RIKER
			Hold it!

	The aliens whirl to see him... he's followed by Picard,
	Geordi (wearing his VISOR), and Troi with phasers. The
	Alien Doctor moves toward Geordi, lifting the cane to
	strike him with it, but --

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    24.

18   GEORDI (OPTICAL)

	grabs the cane with one hand and kicks the alien. The
	Alien Doctor reacts in rage, and lunges back toward
	Geordi; Riker gets off a phaser BLAST in between Geordi
	and the Alien Doctor, who stops in his tracks. He
	reaches out for the Alien Nurse and they --

19   ALIEN COUPLE (OPTICAL)

	crackle with the blue EFFECT of phase-shifting and
	vanish. There is the SOUND of windows breaking. Our
	group looks around, stunned. It's all happened so
	fast. Outside, there are voices reacting to the
	commotion, shouting, etc. Some patients react.

20   INT. DATA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)

	Data moves to his contraption, which is sounding an
	alarm, registering something like a seismograph. Data
	quickly unrolls a map and checks a location with the
	readings on the machine. Then he hurries for the door.

21   INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS

	An orderly runs in, followed by Doctor Apollinaire.
	(Geordi quickly removes his VISOR.)

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			What's all this? What's going
			on here?

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    25.

21   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Apparently a distraught
			relative... she became quite
			upset... we tried to calm her but
			she ran out.

					DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE
			I heard an explosion...

	The group looks innocently mystified.

					RIKER
				(as if he's just
				 arrived)
			How about it? You people see any
			explosion?

					TROI
			There was nothing like that,
			Officer...

					RIKER
			Okay, folks, I suggest you all
			clear out and let the patients
			have a little peace... sorry,
			Doctor.

	Apollinaire nods, trusting in the firm hand of the law.
	But at that moment, in runs another policeman -- this
	one legitimate.

					POLICEMAN
			People said there was gunfire in
			here... What's going on?

					RIKER
			Just a misunderstanding... I'm
			clearing these people out of here.

	The others start for the door as the policeman studies
	Riker.

					POLICEMAN
			I've never seen you before...

					RIKER
			Just got assigned this morning.
			Usually work downtown.

					POLICEMAN
			I worked downtown for three
			years... I don't remember you.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    26.

21   CONTINUED: (2)

	He sees the others starting to leave.

					POLICEMAN
			Hold it!

	He approaches the group.

					POLICEMAN
			I'm going to ask all of you to
			come down to the station for
			questioning.
				(to Riker)
			Including you. Let's go...

	He spots the cane which Geordi holds.

					POLICEMAN
			Where'd you get that? That's a
			gentleman's cane.

	He takes it from Geordi, inspects it with a knowing eye
	-- this is valuable.

					POLICEMAN
			Never saw a cane like this before.
				(tucks it under his arm)
			I'll have to confiscate it.
			Evidence.

	Riker and Picard exchange glances. Riker steps toward
	the policeman.

					RIKER
			I want you to know... I have only
			the greatest respect for the law.

	And he decks him. Riker grabs the cane and the group
	runs for it (Geordi quickly putting his VISOR back on).
	The fallen policeman pulls his whistle and blows.

22   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	as they hurry out of the infirmary, they hear other
	police whistles blowing. Police are hurrying, on foot,
	toward them.

23   ANGLE - DATA IN CARRIAGE

	Rushing toward them is a horse-drawn carriage driven
	by Data. The group reacts in amazement.

    STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT TWO    27.

23   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Data!

	Data has assessed the situation and pulls to a halt.

					GEORDI
			Boy, am I glad to see you!

					DATA
			I would suggest we postpone our
			greetings for another occasion.

					PICARD
				(climbing in)
			Agreed. Let's get out of here.

	As the policeman from inside the infirmary runs out,
	they all quickly pile on and Data starts the horse up
	again. The carriage charges up the street, past the
	converging policemen, who blow their whistles loudly
	but in vain.

                                             FADE OUT.

24   EXT. VICTORIAN BOARDING HOUSE - NEXT DAY - STOCK

25   INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

	The crew investigates the cane.

					GEORDI
			If we tune a phaser to the
			approximate frequency of triolic
			waves, and lay down a field
			burst... it might respond.

	Picard nods, and Geordi sets his phaser, then
	carefully fires a gentle burst -- not directly at the
	cane -- which creates a field. It envelops the cane,
	and it --

26   CANE - INSERT (OPTICAL)

					TROI'S VOICE
			The ophidian the aliens were

27   BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)

	as a number of little "time holes" open up all over the
	room, then fizzle out. Beverly, Data, and Geordi have
	all been reading their tricorders in these brief
	seconds. (Beverly's glasses are in a pocket.)

					RIKER
			What the...

					GEORDI
			Minute space-time distortions...
			like the one we saw on Devidia
			Two...

					RIKER
			But they were so small... and
			they only lasted a second...

					DATA
			The aliens seem to have the
			ability to concentrate the
			distortion -- and direct it toward
			a specific time and destination.

					BEVERLY
			Maybe they have something... a
			-- mechanism, that focuses it.

					GEORDI
			Any device like that would produce
			significant levels of triolic
			waves...

			... like the ones in the cavern
			where Data's head was found.

					DATA
			I have located that cavern --

	Before he can finish, there's a knock at the door.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL'S VOICE
			Mister Picard!

	The group exchanges glances... they still don't have
	the rent money. No one responds.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL'S VOICE
			I know you're in there! Open the
			door!

	Picard makes a silent gesture to the others; they go in
	to a pre-arranged plan. Geordi removes his VISOR and
	puts on the dark glasses.

 STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT THREE 31.

28   ON TROI

	as she walks toward the door, opens it and smiles at
	Mrs. Carmichael.

					TROI
			Mrs. Carmichael... thank goodness
			you're here.

	And before Mrs. Carmichael can speak, Troi pulls her
	in. Over this, we hear:

					DATA/PUCK
			How now, spirit! whither wander
			you?

					BEVERLY/FAIRY
			Over hill, over dale, Through
			bush, through brier, Over park,
			over pale...

29   ANGLE - THE GROUP

	Data, Riker, and Beverly are in a "rehearsal" of
	Midsummer Night's Dream; Picard is the director. He
	turns and, seeing Mrs. Carmichael, gestures grandly.

					PICARD
			Ah -- just in time! We need
			someone to read a part...

	He presses a playbook in her hands, points to a
	passage.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			Mister Picard, I need to be
			talkin' to you...

	Ignoring her, Picard waves at Oberon to begin.

 STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT THREE 32.

					PICARD
			Now, Mrs. Carmichael...
				(points insistently)
			Right there...

					RIKER/OBERON
				(again)
			Ill met by moonlight, proud
			Titania.

	Mrs. Carmichael looks at Picard, perplexed, and at the
	book. She takes a breath.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
				(woodenly - awful)
			What, jealous Oberon. Fairies
			skip hence. I have foresworn his
			bed and company.

					PICARD
			Well, I don't need to hear any
			more. That was -- truly unique.

	She glances up at him.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			Really?

					PICARD
			I think we've found our Titania...
				(to the others)
			... don't you agree?

	The group responds with nods and murmurs of
	appreciation.

29   CONTINUED: (2)

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			Well... I did do a church play
			when I was a lass...

					PICARD
			You see? We'll begin rehearsals
			tomorrow.

	A long pause.

					MRS. CARMICHAEL
			What theatre did you say?

30   EXT. VICTORIAN BOARDING HOUSE - SAME DAY

	The carriage in which the crew made their escape
	stands in front of the boarding house. The Alien
	Doctor and Nurse walk slowly toward it, look at it,
	and exchange glances... this is the one. Then they
	walk slowly on by.

30A  INT. DATA'S HOTEL ROOM

	Guinan is there, pacing. She hears a key in the lock
	and whirls toward the door. It opens and Data ENTERS.

					GUINAN
			There you are! I have good news
			-- we can get into the Presidio
			--

	She stops as Picard, close on Data's heels, ENTERS
	also.

					DATA
			It is all right.

	Picard smiles at the sight of this nineteenth century
	Guinan in her finery. But of course she doesn't know
	him, and addresses Data.

					GUINAN
			General Mallory is usually a
			stickler for the rules... but I
			happen to know that his wife
			thinks she's a singer. So I told
			him she simply must perform at
			my next gathering... and the rules
			just... disappeared.

	She feels Picard's look, and turns to him, regards him
	curiously.

					GUINAN
			You know me...

 STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT THREE 34.

30A  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Very well.

					GUINAN
			Do I know you?

					PICARD
			Not yet. But you will.

	She scrutinizes him carefully... there is an instant
	chemistry between them, in this, their true first
	meeting.

31   EXT. INFIRMARY STREET - SAME DAY

	Start on Clemens, standing among a few by-standers,
	chomping his cigar and listening to the end of a
	conversation.

					YOUNG REPORTER
			Thanks for your help, Officer.

					POLICEMAN
			Make sure you put in the part

			Yessir, I will.

	The Young Reporter turns away and starts reading

31   CONTINUED:

			H'lo, son...

				(a little surprised)
			Mister Clemens... what brings you

					CLEMENS
			A writer's curiosity...

	He glances around to see if they're being overheard,
	moves a little closer to the reporter.

					CLEMENS
			I heard two people vanished into
			thin air in this Infirmary.

					YOUNG REPORTER
				(checking pad)
			One of the patients said that,
			yessir. But the police deny it.

					CLEMENS
			I'll bet they do...

			They say a band of outlaws set
			off an explosion in the

					CLEMENS
			What did these outlaws look like?

					YOUNG REPORTER
				(reading)
			The carriage they escaped in was
			driven by an albino...

			Ah. Mister Data.

	The reporter stares at him.

			You know him?

	away to hail a carriage. The reporter follows.

					YOUNG REPORTER
			An invasion... from the future?
			Mister Clemens... what can you
			tell me about this? Do you have
			any proof?

					CLEMENS
			Young man... when's your deadline?

			Thanks, Mister Clemens...

			Take me to the Presidio, driver.
			And don't spare the whip.

32   INT. CAVERN - LATER

	Geordi and Riker are in one tunnel of the cavern, using
	their tricorders.

					RIKER
			The triolic levels are as high
			as they were on Devidia Two...
				(lowers tricorder)
			... but no indication of any
			control mechanism.

					GEORDI
			I'm not so sure.

	Geordi is peering at the cavern walls through his
	VISOR.

					GEORDI
			My VISOR is picking up crystalline
			fractures. These cavern walls
			have undergone some kind of
			selective molecular polarization.

	He moves along the wall, still peering intently.

					GEORDI
			In fact, if I'm right... this
			whole cavern has been configured
			to focus the space-time
			distortion... just like a lens.

 STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT THREE 36A.

32   CONTINUED:

	They have reached the part of the cavern where the
	others are scanning.

32A  ANOTHER PART OF THE CAVERN (OPTICAL)

	Picard, Troi, Beverly (glasses still in pocket),
	Data, and Guinan; all but the latter are scanning.
	Geordi and Riker join them.

					GEORDI
			Captain, we think we're on to
			something. The cavern itself
			seems to be acting as a focusing
			mechanism... and I'm betting the
			same is true of their habitat
			back on Devidia Two.

					PICARD
			If we can get back there... and
			destroy that site... can we put
			an end to their time
			traveling... ?

					RIKER
			We have the ophidian...

					GEORDI
			But I don't know if it will work.
			The energy our phasers generate
			may not be entirely compatible
			with the ophidian.

	Picard hesitates for only an instant.

					PICARD
			We have no choice but to try.

					CLEMENS' VOICE
			An event I would most certainly
			enjoy witnessing...

32A  CONTINUED:

					CLEMENS
				(gestures with the gun)
			Move along... I suspect even
			time travellers are vulnerable
			to a Colt Forty-Five.
				(removes watch, glances
				 at it)
			Let's go -- I've made a young
			fellow a promise and I don't want
			to be late.

	But before anyone can move, there is a blue phasing
	EFFECT -- and the Alien Doctor and Nurse phase in...
	the others don't have a chance to react when the Alien
	Doctor snatches the cane from Troi.

33   ANGLE - THE ALIENS (OPTICAL)

	They activate the snake just as Data dives at them with
	his super speed -- he grabs for the snake just as it
	flares into action... there is a sonic boom and a hole
	of blinding white light begins to open -- right in
	Data's body.

34   DATA'S BODY (OPTICAL)

	disappears, his head goes flying off and onto the
	cavern floor...

35   GUINAN AND CLEMENS

	are flung backwards by the force of the opening...
	Guinan striking her head on a rock outcropping and
	falling unconscious... Clemens' pistol and watch go
	flying...

36   ANGLE - THE GROUP (OPTICAL)

	The Alien Nurse has been wounded and is lying on the
	ground. The Alien Doctor hesitates briefly... then
	plunges through the hole.

					PICARD
				(to the others)
			Follow him!

	Riker, Geordi, Troi, and Beverly hurry through the
	hole; Picard starts after them, then stops and looks
	back at Guinan. He goes to her, kneels by her side,
	realizing she's badly hurt, feeling her pulse.

   STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT THREE   38.

37   CLEMENS (OPTICAL)

	stands up, staring at the time hole through which the

	to close, he dashes forward and jumps through. The
	hole closes. The cavern is quiet. Picard is now
	trapped in the 19th century.

	FADE IN:

38   EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)

	As seen in Part I, but not phase-shifted (i.e., we
	don't see the aliens or their environment.) The group
	is picking themselves up, shaking off the effects of
	the violent transport.

					RIKER
			Is everybody all right?

					BEVERLY
			I think so...

	She pulls her tricorder... begins checking... and then
	Riker sees Clemens.

					RIKER
			You--!

					CLEMENS
				(rising to his feet,
				 brushing himself off)
			Where are we -- and when is this?

					RIKER
			It's the twenty-fourth century...
			this is Devidia Two -- and you
			shouldn't be here.

					CLEMENS
			Seems to me I have as much right
			to be in your time as you had to
			be in mine. You see, sir, I
			wanted to see how you've conducted
			my future affairs.

					TROI
			Your future affairs?

					CLEMENS
			The affairs of mankind.

					RIKER
			Don't you see -- the disappearance
			of Mark Twain... one of the most
			noted literary figures of the
			nineteenth century...

   STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT FOUR   40.

38   CONTINUED:

					CLEMENS
			Thank you...

					RIKER
			... that's not supposed to happen.

					CLEMENS
			I have only taken advantage of
			an irresistible occasion... as
			any good writer would.

					WORF'S COM VOICE
			Bridge to Away Team...
			acknowledge.

					RIKER
			We're here, Mister Worf. How long
			have we been gone?

					WORF'S COM VOICE
			You have been off sensor displays
			for almost nine days, sir.

					RIKER
			Stand by to transport five...

					GEORDI
				(from a slight distance)
			Commander...

	They move to see that Geordi has found Data's body...
	hand still holding the time-snake, now back to the
	shape of a cane. They regard it sadly.

					RIKER
			Mister Worf... six to transport.

  STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/07/92 - ACT FOUR  41.

39   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

	The group, including Data's body, MATERIALIZES on the
	transporter pad. Clemens reacts to the experience...
	this has been quite a day for him...

					CLEMENS
			Where are we... ?

					RIKER
			The Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
				(to transporter chief)
			Chief, call security. We need
			an escort for this man.

					CLEMENS
				(bristling)
			Security? What for?

	At this point, the door slides open and WORF ENTERS.
	Clemens stares at him, astonished.

					CLEMENS
			A werewolf...

	But Worf is no less astonished at this array of people
	garbed in 19th century clothing.

					RIKER
			It's a long story, Mister Worf...
			I'll brief you later.

					GEORDI
				(to Transporter Chief)
			Have Data's body brought to the
			Medical Lab. I'm going to try
			to re-attach the head we have.

					BEVERLY
				(skeptical)
			That head is almost five hundred
			years old...

					GEORDI
			It's the best chance we've got.

	And he's gone.

   STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT FOUR   42.

39   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(to Worf)
			I want Mister Clemens here under
			escort at all times.

					TROI
			Commander... perhaps I could
			handle that. I'd be happy to take
			Mister Clemens to quarters.

	Riker realizes Troi is offering to make things smoother
	for this unexpected monkey wrench, and is grateful.

					RIKER
			Good idea.
				(to Clemens)
			If you would accompany the
			Counselor...

	Clemens regards her. A handsome woman, indeed.

					CLEMENS
			Madame... I'd be delighted.

	He offers her his arm and Troi takes it; they move
	toward the door.

					CLEMENS
			So this is a space ship, eh? Did
			you ever run into Halley's comet?

40   INT. CAVERN - 19TH CENTURY EARTH

	Picard is with Guinan... he has bandaged her head with
	material from her cape (or something). She is
	regaining consciousness... tries to sit up.

					GUINAN
			Whoa... everything's spinning...

					PICARD
			Don't try to sit up too quickly...
			you've lost a lot of blood.

					GUINAN
			Where'd... everybody go... ?

					PICARD
			I hope they're safely back on the
			Enterprise by now.

	She closes her eyes, fighting to remain conscious.

   STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT FOUR   43.

40   CONTINUED:

					GUINAN
			You're still here...

					PICARD
			You were hurt. I had to make sure
			you were all right.

	She opens her eyes part way, looks at him.

					GUINAN
			You stayed here... for that... ?

					PICARD
			I can't very well let anything
			happen to you... you're far too
			important to me.

	Guinan smiles faintly... she is fading.

					GUINAN
			You know... so much about me...

					PICARD
			Believe me, in the future the
			tables will be turned.

					GUINAN
			We... become friends...

					PICARD
			It goes beyond friendship.

					GUINAN
			But... I have to wait... almost
			five hundred years...
				(beat)
			And when we meet... I won't be
			able to tell you about this, will
			I?

					PICARD
			No. Because for me, it won't have
			happened yet.

	She smiles, shaking her head at this puzzlement. As
	she does, she spots Data's head on the floor of the
	cavern.

					GUINAN
			What happened... ?

	Picard rises, moves to the head, saddened by the
	tragedy he had hoped to avoid.

  STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/06/92 - ACT FOUR  44.

40   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			History fulfilling itself...

41   INT. TEN FORWARD

	Riker with Guinan at the bar.

					GUINAN
			History has to fulfill itself.
			Even Picard knew that.

					RIKER
			You were there, in the cavern.
			You know what happened. What
			am I supposed to do?

	She gazes at him, implacable. She is silent. His
	frustration mounts.

					RIKER
			Damn it, Guinan, don't play games
			with me... I need answers.

					GUINAN
			If I tell you what happened in
			that cavern, it would affect any
			decision you're about to make.
			I can't do that. I won't do that.

					RIKER
			Not telling me might affect my
			decision, too... did you think
			of that?

	She does not respond. Riker leans in to her,
	frustrated.

					RIKER
			We're talking about Jean-Luc
			Picard. I'm not going to sit
			around and hope it all works
			out... I've got to do something...

	He waits, hoping she'll relent. But she holds his gaze
	unflinchingly. Finally, angry at her stubbornness, he
	gets up and EXITS. Guinan stares after him, her
	thoughts, as always, her own.

43A  INT. CORRIDOR

	Clemens walking with Troi; she's been giving him a tour
	of the ship. A strange-looking alien passes them in
	the hall. Clemens stares, turns to look at him as he
	walks by.

					CLEMENS
			Any place that doesn't stock a
			good cigar doesn't rank high in
			my book.

					TROI
			If you must have one, I'm sure
			we could replicate it for you.

					CLEMENS
				(pained)
			You think one of those --
			imitations -- could take the place
			of a hand-wrapped Havana?

					TROI
				(mildly)
			I wouldn't know...

					CLEMENS
			That's the problem I see here...
			all this technology... it only
			serves to take away life's simple
			pleasures. You don't even let
			a man open a door for a lady.

					TROI
			I think what we've gained
			outweighs anything that might have
			been lost...

       STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT FOUR      47.

43A  CONTINUED:

					CLEMENS
			Oh? I'm not so impressed with
			this future... huge starships...
			weapons that can no doubt destroy
			entire cities... military conquest
			as a way of life.

	She looks sidelong at him.

					TROI
			Is that what you see here?

					CLEMENS
			Oh, I know what you say... this
			is a vessel of exploration... your
			mission is to, discover new
			worlds...

	The Turbolift arrives. A strange alien EXITS. Clemens
	reacts, stares after him. They ENTER the Turbolift.

43B  INT. TURBOLIFT

					TROI
			Deck thirty-six.

					CLEMENS
			That's what the Spanish said...
			and the Dutch, and the Portuguese.
			It's what all conquerors say...
				(beat)
			I'm sure it's what you told that
			blue skinned fellow I just
			saw... before you brought him
			here to serve you.

					TROI
			He's one of thousands of species
			we've encountered. We live in
			a peaceful Federation with many
			of them... the people you see are
			here by choice.

	Clemens ponders this for a moment.

					CLEMENS
			So there are a privileged few...
			who serve on these ships, living
			in luxury, wanting for nothing.
			But what about everyone else?
			What about the poor? You ignore
			them...

        STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow, Pt. 2" - 7/02/92 - ACT FOUR       48.

43B  CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Poverty was eliminated a long time
			ago. And a lot of things
			disappeared with it:
			hopelessness... despair...
			cruelty... war...

	He regards her solemnly. He's beginning to realize
	that his dark view is misplaced.

					CLEMENS
			I come from a time when men
			achieve wealth and power by
			standing on the backs of the
			poor... when prejudice and
			intolerance are commonplace...
			when power is an end unto
			itself...
				(beat)
			And you're telling me... that
			isn't how it is anymore?

					TROI
			That's right.

					CLEMENS
				(with a sigh)
			Maybe it is worth giving up cigars
			for, after all...

	Troi smiles... the Turbolift door opens and they EXIT.

43C  INT. CORRIDOR

	Outside the Medical Lab.

					CLEMENS
			Tell me.... how long was it...
			before things began to change?

					TROI
			A long time. The people of your
			lifetime won't see it.

	Clemens nods solemnly. They have reached the Medical
	Lab.

44   INT. MEDICAL LAB

	As they ENTER, they see Geordi has re-attached Data's
	body and four-hundred-year-old head.

					GEORDI
			Not so far. His restart units
			won't initialize.

44   CONTINUED:

					GEORDI (Cont'd)
			I thought his buffering program
			would have protected them... but
			I guess five hundred years was
			just too long a wait.

	Clemens notices something on a nearby table... picks
	up the watch from the cavern.

					CLEMENS
			My watch...

					GEORDI
			It was found in the cavern... near
			Data's head.
				(beat)
			After five hundred years, I
			doubt that it'll work either.

	Clemens puts the watch back and regards the lifeless
	android sadly.

					CLEMENS
			Mister Data... I fear I sadly
			misjudged you.
				(beat)
			As I have misjudged many things.

	He exchanges a look with Troi... who realizes this is
	a man with a lot to think about.

45   INT. CAVERN - 19TH CENTURY EARTH (OPTICAL)

	The alien nurse is stirring... phasing slightly from
	her human to her alien form because she is so badly
	injured. Picard goes toward her.

					PICARD
			Can you communicate?

	There is a pause... and then she speaks in a strange,
	gutteral voice (electronically enhanced).

					ALIEN NURSE
			Yes...

					PICARD
			Are you injured?

					ALIEN NURSE
				(beat)
			Why have you interfered?

					ALIEN NURSE
			We need your energy...

45   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Perhaps we could find a
			substitute...

					ALIEN NURSE
			No... there is none... we must
			continue.

					PICARD
			We cannot allow that.
				(beat)
			We know how you move back and
			forth through time... my crew
			has returned to the twenty-fourth
			century to destroy your transport
			site on Devidia Two --

					ALIEN NURSE
			Destroy it?

	She fixes her dying eyes on him... a mirthless smile
	appears on her lips.

					ALIEN NURSE
			Your weapons will only amplify
			the time distortion... you will
			annihilate your own world...

	She phases out of existence. Picard is left to ponder
	the implications of her words.

			I'm going back for the Captain...
			Mister Worf, prepare an Away Team
			to accompany me to the surface.
				(to Beverly)
			Doctor, I need to know anything
			you can tell me about that

					BEVERLY
			I've just started running some

					RIKER
			We can't give the aliens any

					BEVERLY
			Wil, I haven't been able to

			I accept the risk.

	Beverly EXITS as:

			Sir... permission to speak

47   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Go ahead.

					WORF
			Our priority is to stop the aliens
			from making any more incursions
			to Earth. Any delay is

					RIKER
			If I can save Captain Picard, I
			consider it very acceptable.

					WORF
			The Captain would not.
				(beat)
			I recommend we target photon
			torpedoes on the alien habitat
			and destroy it immediately.

	Riker gives him a look. Then he glances toward Troi.

					TROI
			He's right, Wil.

	There is a long moment. Riker has no answer.
	Finally... with great difficulty...

	He closes the panel, opens another one, fiddles in it.

					GEORDI
			Computer, run a diagnostic on the

					COMPUTER VOICE
			There is intermittent contact
			in the input polarizers.

					GEORDI
			Intermittent?

	He selects an instrument, with which he scans the

	particle of something, peers at it.

					GEORDI
			An iron filing... how did that

49   INT. CAVERN - 19TH CENTURY EARTH

	Guinan is unconscious; Picard checks Guinan's pulse
	and is satisfied that she is all right. He glances
	over and sees --

49A  DATA'S HEAD

	lying on the ground.

49B  PICARD

	considers it for a moment, and then walks over, picks
	it up. An idea occurs to him. He snaps open a panel
	in the back of the head and studies it.

       STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT FIVE      54.

49B  CONTINUED:

	Then he looks around on the cavern floor... spots
	something, picks it up. It is a flat-head nail.

	Using the nail, he begins to fiddle in the back of
	Data's head. He frowns slightly... he's not sure of
	this procedure, it is awkward and unfamiliar. He holds
	the nail up to the light for a moment, squints at it...
	scrapes some rust from the tip... and begins once more
	to do something in the back of Data's head.

49C  INT. BRIDGE

	Riker, Worf, and N.D.'s as needed.

54   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			If I am correct... we must modify
			our weapons so that the force of
			the explosion is re-phased into
			the aliens' time continuum.

	Riker casts a look at Geordi.

					GEORDI
			If we outfit the photons with
			phase discriminators... we could
			get the necessary variance.

					RIKER
			How long will it take you?

					GEORDI
			At least a couple of hours.

	Riker realizes this gives him a window of opportunity.

					RIKER
			Fine. That'll give me time to
			go get him.

			Sir?

					RIKER
			There's time now... I'm going
			back to the nineteenth century
			for the Captain.
				(to Beverly)
			Doctor... ?

					BEVERLY
			My analysis of the phasers

					BEVERLY
			That's right.

			I'm the one who should return to

					RIKER
			There's a risk... we're not

			There's risk in everything. The

					CLEMENS
			I'm glad I have the chance to
			thank you.

					DATA
			For what?

					CLEMENS
			For starting me on the greatest

			No. You need help.

	Suddenly they hear footsteps off in the darkness of

	ready. The footsteps grow closer... and then Clemens
	emerges into the light, out of breath and puffing.

	Clemens with Guinan and Picard.

					CLEMENS
			No time for chit-chat, sir...
				(hands Picard the cane)
			According to Mister La Forge --
			who did get your message by the
			way -- a frequency setting of
			point-oh-four-seven on your phaser
			will correctly activate this
			creature.

					PICARD
			You'll have to get help. Guinan
			needs medical attention...

					CLEMENS
			I promise you she will be attended
			to.

					PICARD
				(beat)
			We have a bill at Mrs.
			Carmichael's boarding house --

					CLEMENS
			It will be settled.

					PICARD
			Thank you.
				(beat)
			I wish time had allowed me to know
			you better...

					CLEMENS
			You'll just have to read my books.
			What I am is pretty much there.

	Picard turns to Guinan...

					GUINAN
			I'll see you in five hundred
			years, Picard.

	He smiles at her...

					PICARD
			I'll see you... in a few minutes.

	And on their looks --

56   INT. BRIDGE

	Data sees something on his sensors.

					DATA
			Commander... I am picking up
			massive triolic wave activity on
			the surface.

					RIKER
				(instantly alert)
			Is it the Captain?

					DATA
			There are no human life signs.

	Riker frowns... what does this new wrinkle mean?

					RIKER
			No sign of a temporal distortion?

					DATA
			No, sir. But triolic activity
			is increasing.

					RIKER
				(resigned)
			The aliens...

	Riker realizes he cannot wait.

					RIKER
			Mister Worf, are the photons
			ready?

					WORF
			Yes, sir.

					RIKER
				(beat)
			Fire.

56A  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	as four torpedoes are projected from the ship.

       STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT FIVE      60.

56B  INT. BRIDGE

	as before.

					WORF
			Torpedoes away, sir.

					DATA
			Commander -- I am detecting a
			temporal distortion on the
			surface... and human life signs.

	Riker reacts with alarm.

58   EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)

	Picard, groggy and disoriented, lies on the ground.

	Suddenly an EXPLOSION rips through the chamber,
	illuminating it in a white light. As the light floods
	the area, we can see the shapes of the aliens, their
	phased world revealed from the effect of the
	re-configured torpedoes. Almost immediately that world
	shimmers out.

59   INT. BRIDGE

					RIKER
			O'Brien -- get him out of there!

59A  EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)

	Picard, jarred by the explosion, is groggily awake...
	almost immediately, the transporter EFFECT shimmers on
	him -- and then there is an overwhelming EXPLOSION: the
	light is a brilliant white that completely wipes the
	screen.

59B  INT. BRIDGE

					RIKER
			Transporter Room -- do you have
			him?

	A beat, then --

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			He does indeed, Commander. And
			believe me... it's good to be
			back.

       STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT FIVE      61.

59B  CONTINUED:

					WORF
			We have destroyed the target, sir.
			There is no further indication
			of triolic activity.

	Riker lets out a sigh of relief.

					RIKER
			Ensign, lay in a course to the
			nearest Starbase. Warp six.

62   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	warps off to continuing adventures.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46001.3.

62A  INT. TEN FORWARD

	Picard ENTERS... spots Guinan behind the bar... walks
	to her and sits down. She gives him a smile... he
	smiles back. There are no words spoken, but the
	reunion of good friends is a poignant one. Over this:

       STAR TREK: "Time's... , Pt. 2" - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT FIVE     61A.

62A  CONTINUED:

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Everyone who should be in the
			nineteenth century is safely
			there, and those who should be
			in the twenty-fourth are here.
			Mister Data has been restored to
			us, head and all... and Samuel
			Clemens will write the books he
			was to have written after our
			encounter.

63   INT. CAVERN - 19TH CENTURY EARTH

	A pair of litter-bearers are carrying Guinan out of the
	cavern. Clemens looks down at her.

					CLEMENS
			Be careful not to jostle her too
			much, boys...
				(to Guinan)
			Don't worry... you're going to
			be fine...

	He watches as she is carried past him... then he turns
	and looks back into the interior of the cavern. His
	eye is caught by something on the ground.

	He moves forward, stoops... and picks up his watch,
	fallen there after the time-hole was opened. He opens
	it... looks at it... snaps it shut and starts to put it
	in his pocket.

	But then he reconsiders. The watch... like the gun and
	the glasses, and Data's head, must remain here, if
	history is to remain intact. He puts the watch back on
	the ground... looks around again, then turns and EXITS.

	Camera DRIFTS into the cavern... into a darkened
	corner... and we see Data's HEAD... waiting to be
	discovered again five hundred years in the future.

                                             FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FIVE                         

                            THE END
