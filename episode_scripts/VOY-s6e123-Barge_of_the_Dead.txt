Title: Barge of the Dead
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: October 6, 1999


[Shuttlecraft]

TORRES: Torres to Voyager. I could use a little help here!
CHAKOTAY [OC]: What's your status?
TORRES: I'm approaching your position, but that ion storm blew out my
deflector field. I've lost helm control and I'm venting plasma from the
port nacelle.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We're modifying a tractor pulse to slow you down.
TORRES: Acknowledged.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: The arresting fields are in place. You're clear to land.
JANEWAY [OC]: Hold on, B'Elanna. This is going to be bumpy.

[Shuttlecraft - in shuttlebay]

PARIS: B'Elanna? Are you alive?
TORRES: You tell me.
PARIS: You've got a mild concussion.
TORRES: That's the best thing that's happened to me all day.

[Ready room]

JANEWAY: When I give you an order, I expect you to follow it. I told you
to return to Voyager, not chase the probe into the centre of an ion storm.
TORRES: We only have one multi-spatial probe. I didn't want to lose it.
JANEWAY: We only have one B'Elanna Torres. I don't want to lose her,
either.
TORRES: Understood.
JANEWAY: Lanna, I'm glad you made it back in one piece,
TORRES: Did you just call me Lanna?
JANEWAY: I suppose I did.
TORRES: That's what my mother used to call me.
JANEWAY: Well then, I'm in good company.

[Torres' quarters]

TORRES: Come in.
CHAKOTAY: Feeling better?
TORRES: I've felt worse.
CHAKOTAY: I found something you might be interested in. It's what my
ancestors called a monkey wrench. It was lodged in your port nacelle.
TORRES: How did it get there?
CHAKOTAY: Judging by your sensor logs, it looks like you ran into it
after your deflector field collapsed, but the big question is, how did it
get in this quadrant?
TORRES: What do you mean? What? It's Klingon!
CHAKOTAY: And it's old. That's about all we know. Looks like the Klingons
beat Starfleet to the Delta quadrant by a few hundred years. You may be
holding the most important archaeological find in Klingon history.
TORRES: Remind me to plant a flag on behalf of the Empire. You know, the
simplest explanation is that the Borg assimilated a Bird of Prey
somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant and they blew it out an airlock on their
way home.
CHAKOTAY: Maybe so. In any case, it makes a nice souvenir.
VOICES [OC]: Unintelligible cacophony

[Engineering]

TORRES: Harry, it bled, it screamed. There's got to be some explanation.
KIM: Hey, I've got one for you. You hit your head harder than you thought.
TORRES: I wasn't hallucinating. Now run a sub-molecular scan.
KIM: How many more scans are we going to run? There's nothing there. No
fluid or vapour residue.
TORRES: We may find some irregularities at the atomic level.
KIM: It's a hunk of metal. What you heard may have had nothing to do with
this artefact. Maybe the comm. system picked up some stray signal from a
pulsar I don't know.
TORRES: A pulsar that speaks Klingon?
KIM: Okay, B'Elanna, there probably is some explanation for what happened
but it's oh three hundred hours. I'm tired, you're tired. Let's just
stick this thing in a containment field and deal with it in the morning.
NEELIX: Ah! Just the Daughter of the Empire I've been looking for. I
wanted to be the first to congratulate you on your discovery of the
Klingon artefact!
TORRES: Neelix, I ran into it with a shuttle.
NEELIX: Some of the greatest discoveries in Klingon history were
accidents. When Sarpek the Fearless unearthed the Knife of Kirom he was
searching for his lost targ. Isn't that amazing? I've been doing some
research.
TORRES: Why?
NEELIX: Well, I'm planning a celebration. This must be the treasure.
TORRES: Neelix, look, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but since I'm the
only Klingon onboard there's really no point in throwing a party.
NEELIX: Oh, nonsense. This artefact isn't just a testament to Klingon
spirit. It's a piece of the Alpha quadrant, a symbol of Voyager's home,
and that's just as worthy of celebration and song as finding some old
knife.
KIM: The man's got a point.
NEELIX: And besides, I've already replicated five barrels of bloodwine.
I'm not going to let them go to waste. Festivities begin at nineteen
hundred hours. Oh, er, I almost forgot. As guest of honour, you're going
to be expected to say a few words on behalf of your people.
KIM: It sounds like you've got a big day ahead of you. You should
probably get some rest.
TORRES: All right, all right, let's call it a night.
KIM: Thank you.

[Tuvok's quarters]

TUVOK: Do not underestimate the power of the mind. The artefact was a
catalyst for your already active imagination. It served as an unwelcome
reminder of your ancestry. The self-loathing you experience when you look
in the mirror and see a Klingon.
TORRES: Who said anything about self-loathing?
TUVOK: You despise being Klingon. It's no secret. What you experienced in
your quarters was a subconscious manifestation of that hatred. The blood
in your veins, the voices of your ancestors, all symbols of your Klingon
heritage.
TORRES: And when the blood disappeared that was, what? Me trying to
vaporise that part of myself?
TUVOK: Yes, but the essence of who you are the artefact itself remained.
TORRES: And the moral of the story is?
TUVOK: Quite simple. That despite your efforts to become something else,
whether it be Starfleet or Maquis, your Klingon nature continues to
assert itself.
TORRES: That's an intriguing theory.
TUVOK: Perhaps we should forego your meditation in favour of a different
exercise.
TORRES: Fine by me. This should be interesting.
TUVOK: Feel the weight of the bat'leth in your hands. Describe the first
thought that enters your mind.
TORRES: It's a clumsy weapon. Overstated, like everything else Klingon.
TUVOK: You can't see the elegance of its design because of your hatred.
TORRES: I don't hate Klingons.
TUVOK: It's a warrior's blade, crafted for precision and balance. Observe.
TORRES: Is this your idea of therapy?
TUVOK: Listen to yourself whine like a Ferengi!
TORRES: PetaQ!
TUVOK: You're not worthy of the blood in your veins. A true Klingon would
try to kill me where I stand!
TORRES: What the hell has gotten into you?
TUVOK: This exercise is over. You are dismissed, Lieutenant, and take
your dishonour with you.

[Mess hall]

EMH: 'ej HumtaH 'ej DechtaH 'Iw. And the blood was ankle-deep. 'ej Doq
SodTah ghoSpa' Sqral bIQtiQ. And the river Skral ran crimson red.
SEVEN: I fail to see the merit of learning a Klingon drinking song.
EMH: It's not about drinking, Seven. It's about saluting the noble deeds
of our ancestors and honouring those who fell in battle. Think, Qapla'.
Think, long live the Empire!
SEVEN: Think again.
EMH: Okay, so I'm overdoing it a bit but try to get into the spirit of
the occasion!
SEVEN: Very well. 'ej HumtaH 'ej DechtaH 'Iw.
BOTH: 'ej Doq SodTah ghoSpa' Sqral bIQtiQ 'e' pa' jaj law' mo' jaj puS
jaj qeylIS molar MIgh HoHchu'.
NEELIX: Gagh, anyone? Sop joq jih yuv gagh drek.
TORRES: He said, Eat this or he'll force it down the gullet of your
corpse.
NEELIX: No offence.
PARIS: Oh, none taken. So this is replicated, right?
NEELIX: Unfortunately.
PARIS: And how do you get it to move?
NEELIX: I used a kinaesthetic agent to give it a little oomph.
TORRES: Is it just me, or has everyone gone Klingon-happy?
PARIS: Oh, come on, B'Elanna. They're all doing this for you.
TORRES: Well, then they don't know me very well, and if you even think of
joining in on this embrace your heritage nonsense, I swear, I'll rip out
your tongue and wear it as a belt.
PARIS: Oh, no there's not a lot of Klingon in you.
TORRES: I inherited the forehead and the bad attitude. That's it. She
would have loved all this.
PARIS: Your mother?
TORRES: She was so obsessed with Klingon ritual and myths. It used to
drive my father and me crazy. Did I ever tell you that she put me in a
Klingon monastery?
PARIS: You're kidding.
TORRES: It was after their marriage ended. She pulled me out of a
Federation school in order to teach me honour and discipline.
PARIS: Out of the plasma cooker and into the fire.
TORRES: She prayed to Kahless every day to guide me in the ways of the
warrior. I guess he wasn't listening.
JANEWAY: Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention, please? I
hate to interrupt the festivities, but before I turn the floor over to
our resident Klingon I'd like to say a few words. This is a great day for
the Klingon Empire. A day when we honour their ancestors, those warriors
whose deeds of valour and glory led them to the Delta quadrant. May they
live on in song and story.
TORRES: Captain!
BROK'TAN: Legh soh va gre'thor.

[Barge of the Dead - on deck]

TORRES: Where am I?
BROK'TAN: Silence The dead ask no questions.
TORRES: Computer, end programme.
BROK'TAN: Qem nuh meq.
TORRES: Let go of me! Wait, wait.
BROK'TAN: Uch ghah!
TORRES: No, wait. (screams)
BROK'TAN: She won't take the mark.
TORRES: What the hell is going on?
BROK'TAN: Qus'daq ba'. Qus'daq na ghah.
TORRES: Where am I?
HIJ'QA: You should know; you're half Klingon.
TORRES: Enlighten me.
HIJ'QA: This is the Barge of the Dead. Our dishonoured souls are being
taken to Gre'thor.
TORRES: Klingon Hell is a myth.
HIJ'QA: That's what I thought. Just a foolish superstition. Imagine my
surprise.
TORRES: But I was on Voyager with my crew.
HIJ'QA: That was the naj, the dream before dying. When we can't accept
that we've died we create the illusion of life to hold on to.
TORRES: He slaughtered my friends.
HIJ'QA: No, he slaughtered the dream. He dragged you from the illusion of
life. This is where you belong.
VOICES [OC]: Hij'qa. Mag hoshonah nes'a Gre'thor. Jih neh. Jih ghaj nug
soh neh. Jih qhaj nug soh. Nug soh los. Vav, nuqdaq sho? Nuqdaq' oh
puchpa'e'
TORRES: What is that?
HIJ'QA: It's the kos'karii. They'll try to lure you to them. Don't listen!
VOICES [OC]: Duj tlvoqtah. Batlh daqawlu'tah. Tugh!
CHAKOTAY [OC]: B'Elanna, are you there?
JANEWAY [OC]: Lieutenant, can you hear me?
PARIS [OC]: Help us find you.
TORRES: Tom? Chakotay?
HIJ'QA: It's not your friends. There are things here worse than death.
BROK'TAN: You.
KORTAR: Is this the mongrel child you spoke of.
BROK'TAN: Yes. The one whose face would not bear the mark.
KORTAR: B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your time.
TORRES: How do you know my name?
KORTAR: You've come close to boarding this ship many times. I remember
the first. You were a child. Your mother took you to the Sea of Gatan.
Your curiosity was as deep as the water.
TORRES: I fell in. I almost drowned.
KORTAR: When your mother breathed life back into your lungs she told you
about me.
TORRES: So you're supposed to be Kortar.
KORTAR: Ah. You remember me.
TORRES: I remember the myth of Kortar, the first Klingon. He destroyed
the gods who created him.
KORTAR: And as punishment, I was condemned to ferry the souls of the
dishonoured to Gre'thor.
TORRES: I may have believed in you as a child, but not anymore.
KORTAR: If you didn't still believe you wouldn't be here. Foolish girl.
You cannot harm me, I'm already dead.
TORRES: What's happening.
KORTAR: The soul of another dishonoured warrior is being delivered.
BROK'TAN: Kot'mah soh Gre'thor.
TORRES: Mother.

[Sickbay]

EMH: It's all right. You're safe.
PARIS: Your shuttle was drifting on the trailing edge of an ion storm.
You lost life support. We found you just in time.
TORRES: But I got through the storm. I remember crashing into the shuttle
bay.
EMH: When we tractored your shuttle back to Voyager, you were in a coma.
PARIS: We almost lost you.
TORRES: The Klingon artefact.
PARIS: Artefact?
TORRES: My hand.
EMH: You took quite a beating out there. More than your fair share of
cuts and bruises.

[Torres' quarters]

TORRES: Come in.
CHAKOTAY: How are you feeling?
TORRES: Um. A little out of place.
CHAKOTAY: Would you like to talk about it?
TORRES: Yes, and no.
CHAKOTAY: Let me know when you decide.
TORRES: I don't know how to say this without sounding crazy.
CHAKOTAY: Try.
TORRES: Do you believe in an afterlife?
CHAKOTAY: I accept there are things in the universe than can't be scanned
with a tricorder. What happened to you out there?
TORRES: I think I died. I died, and I was on the Barge of the Dead in the
Klingon afterlife.
CHAKOTAY: Klingon mythology has been ingrained in you since you were a
child. It's not surprising you experienced some of those images while you
were unconscious.
TORRES: I saw my mother, Chakotay. If it was real, then she's dead.
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, your mother, the Barge of the Dead, those are just
symbols. It's your subconscious mind trying to tell you something.
TORRES: Tell me what? That my mother is going to Hell?
CHAKOTAY: You need time to digest what you experienced. You have to
interpret the symbols and search for their meaning.
TORRES: What if there is no symbolism to interpret? What if the afterlife
is real? I'm an engineer. My whole life I've immersed myself in science
and schematics. But what if it's time to start looking beyond that?
CHAKOTAY: My grandfather used to think he could transform himself into a
wolf so that he could venture out to explore the spirit realm. It was
real to him, as real as what your experience was to you, but that doesn't
mean he grew hair all over his body and walked around on all fours.
TORRES: My mother has been on my mind a lot lately. We just had a big
anniversary. It's been ten years since we talked. But it was so real. I
could taste the blood in the air, I could feel the wind. I was seasick
from the rocking of the boat.

[Engineering]

PARIS: Hi.
TORRES: Hi.
PARIS: What are you reading?
TORRES: The paq'bath. It's a sacred Klingon scroll.
PARIS: Find anything?
TORRES: You don't want to know.
PARIS: Oh, come on. It can't be that bad.
TORRES: You want to bet? I found out why my mother is on her way to
Gre'thor. It's because I sent her there.
PARIS: What do you mean?
TORRES: The sins of the child. She's being punished for my dishonour. I
turned my back on everything Klingon and now she has to pay the price.
PARIS: B'Elanna, you can't even be sure your mother is dead, much less
blame yourself for what happens to her in some afterlife.
TORRES: Look at this. The eleventh tome of Klavek. It's a story about
Kahless returning from the dead still bearing a wound from the afterlife.
A warning that what he experienced wasn't a dream. The same thing
happened to me.
PARIS: B'Elanna.
TORRES: And the only reason Kahless was in the afterlife to begin with
was to rescue his brother from the Barge of the Dead and deliver him to
Sto-Vo-Kor.
PARIS: Okay.
TORRES: Don't you see? I have a chance to rescue my mother, if I can
accept responsibility for her dishonour before she passes through the
gates of Gre'thor. I have to go back.
PARIS: Well, wait a minute, what do you mean, go back?
TORRES: I can't let her suffer for what I've done. It's the only way.
PARIS: B'Elanna, I respect what you believe in but you're starting to
scare me!
TORRES: I'm scaring myself.

[Briefing room]

TORRES: It's a controlled procedure. I'll be under constant supervision.
The Doctor can simulate the conditions of the ion storm. He's agreed to
help me, but only with your permission.
JANEWAY: I'm still not inclined to grant your request.
TORRES: Are you telling me that I can't pursue my spiritual beliefs?
JANEWAY: B'Elanna, I'm not going to let you turn this into a debate about
freedom of worship.
TORRES: But that's what it is.
JANEWAY: There's a limit to how far I'll let religious practices go
aboard this ship. If your belief system required you to sacrifice a child
to your gods I wouldn't allow that, either.
TORRES: That's an absurd example.
JANEWAY: You want to simulate a near death experience so you can revisit
the Barge of Death, and you're telling me what's absurd? Bottom line,
B'Elanna. I'm not going to let you risk your life for this.
TORRES: Captain, please.
JANEWAY: Request denied.
TORRES: What I do with my own life is one thing, but to know that I have
condemned my mother. That because of what I've done, she's
JANEWAY: I appreciate what you're trying to say, B'Elanna, but whatever
you experienced, it wasn't real.
TORRES: It doesn't matter if you think it was real. It was real to me.
Whatever it was, it changed me. I can't ignore that. I need to confront
what's happened.
JANEWAY: I'm sorry.
TORRES: You know, you're just like her.
JANEWAY: Lieutenant?
TORRES: My mother. You're as dedicated to Starfleet principles as she was
to Klingon honour. I know that we haven't always seen eye to eye, but
despite our differences you helped me become a good officer and I'd like
to think that you're proud of me for it.
JANEWAY: I am.
TORRES: My mother never had the chance to be proud of me. I'd like her to
know me the way you do. I don't want her to die thinking of me as a
disgrace. You have to let me do this.

[Sickbay]

PARIS: I can't believe the Captain is allowing this. One minute you're in
a coma, the next you're a born-again Klingon? I, I just don't get it.
TORRES: I'm not sure I get it, either. I just know this is something I
have to do.
PARIS: There must be an easier way for you to explore your spirituality.
Go to church, or something?
TORRES: It wouldn't be enough.
PARIS: Look, I'll read the scrolls, I'll learn Klingon. We'll figure this
out together.
TORRES: Next time.
PARIS: I just hope there is a next time.
TORRES: There will be.
JANEWAY: Report.
EMH: I've examined the sensor logs from the shuttle mission. I should be
able to re-create the exact conditions that triggered her near-death
experience.
JANEWAY: Good. B'Elanna?
TORRES: I'm ready.
PARIS: Be careful.
JANEWAY: You'll have an hour to do whatever it is you need to do. At the
first sign of trouble, we're bringing you out. Understood?
EMH: Computer, erect an isolation field around the surgical bay. Decrease
oxygen concentration within the force field by twenty seven percent.
Begin ionising the enclosed atmosphere to five thousand particles per
cubic metre. She's unconscious.
PARIS: Neural activity is decreasing to eighty seven percent, sixty two
percent. Synaptic function is failing.
EMH: Compensating.
PARIS: Neural activity is nominal.
JANEWAY: She's not breathing.
EMH: She's still alive. Her lungs are taking in just enough oxygen to
keep her brain from necrotising.
JANEWAY: Qapla', B'Elanna.

[Barge of the Dead - on deck]

BROK'TAN [OC]: Sus'a g gre'thor qay.

[Barge of the Dead - below decks]

TORRES: Mother.
MIRAL: Stay away. You are an illusion. You're a kos'karii trying to lure
me away
TORRES: Mother, it's me. It's me.
MIRAL: B'Elanna? Then you died as well?
TORRES: I've come to lift your dishonour.
MIRAL: But you don't believe in Sto-Vo-Kor.
TORRES: A lot's happened since the last time I saw you. I've changed.
MIRAL: Not enough. It was you who brought this damnation upon me.
TORRES: If you hadn't tried to force me to become a warrior.
MIRAL: I tried to guide you in the ways of a Klingon.
TORRES: You tried a little too hard.
MIRAL: If you had listened to me when you were younger, we wouldn't be on
the Barge of the Dead. You were always running away.
TORRES: You drove me away, the same way you drove away my father.
MIRAL: He abandoned us.
TORRES: You pushed him to the point where he couldn't bear to be around
anything Klingon, including me.
MIRAL: I wanted to give you honour, and if you had understood that I
would be not be on my way to Gre'thor.
TORRES: We're on the Barge of the Dead and we're still having the same
argument we were having ten years ago. Look, if I have dishonoured you I
am truly sorry.
MIRAL: Are you? You have too much anger in your heart to be sorry.
TORRES: Oh, we don't have time for this if we're going to perform the
transference.
MIRAL: Is that how you intend to lift my dishonour? By taking my place?
TORRES: Oh, don't worry. I have no intention of being on this barge when
it gets to Gre'thor. We've got just enough time to perform the ritual
before my crew resuscitates me.
MIRAL: Oh. I should have known you'd choose the easy way.
TORRES: What are you talking about? Do you know the risks I've taken to
save you?
MIRAL: You still understand nothing about being a Klingon. I would rather
face damnation with what little honour you have left me, than cheat my
way into Sto-Vo-Kor.
BROK'TAN: There she is. Bring them.

[Barge of the Dead - on deck]

KORTAR: The mongrel child has returned.
TORRES: I'm here to take my mother's place.
MIRAL: B'Elanna!
KORTAR: You wish to claim her dishonour as your own?
TORRES: Yes.
KORTAR: You're willing to die for her?
TORRES: Yes. Release her to Sto-Vo-Kor.
MIRAL: No!
KORTAR: Keep her quiet! It's not your decision. She has the right to
reclaim your honour. Once we've reached Gre'thor and you are within its
gates I will release her.
TORRES: No. Now.
KORTAR: You're very impatient. Time must be slipping away in the living
world. You're concerned that your friends will revive you before you
complete your deception. Did you really think that I could be fooled so
easily?
TORRES: I will die for her. No tricks, no games. I will take her place
honourably, like a Klingon.
KORTAR: If you choose this path your friends will not be able to save you.
MIRAL: No! I forbid it!
TORRES: I understand.
KORTAR: Your dishonour has been lifted. Sto-Vo-Kor awaits you.
MIRAL: I will not abandon my daughter!
KORTAR: She has made the choice. Go! Daughter of Miral, embrace your fate.

[Sickbay]

PARIS: Her neural patterns are breaking down!
EMH: I'm initiating emergency resuscitation. Vent the ionised particles.
Twenty milligrams cordrazine, now!
JANEWAY: I'm deactivating the force field.

[Gre'thor Sickbay]

EMH: Welcome to Gre'thor.
TORRES: This isn't Gre'thor.
EMH: Oh, I assure you it is. You've taken your mark.
TORRES: What is this, some kind of a joke?
NEELIX: This is no laughing matter.
EMH: You've met Mister Neelix, our ambassador to the recently deceased.
Questions, comments, suggestions, he's your man.
NEELIX: If you'll follow me.
EMH: By the way, I'll be performing an aria from Berlioz's Faust tomorrow
night in Holodeck two. Feel free to stop by.

[Gre'thor Corridor]

NEELIX: Fifteen decks. Computers augmented with bio-neural circuitry. Top
cruising speed, warp nine point nine seven five, not that you'll be going
anywhere.
TORRES: No Fek'lhr? No Cavern of Despair?
NEELIX: Don't need them.
TORRES: I don't consider Voyager hell.
NEELIX: Are you sure? Have you ever been truly happy here? If you thought
fifty years aboard this ship would be difficult, try eternity.

[Gre'thor Mess hall]

ALL: 'ej HumtaH 'ej DechtaH 'Iw 'ej Doq SodTah ghoSpa' Sqral bIQtiQ 'e'
pa' jaj law' mo' jaj puS.
JANEWAY: This is a great day for B'Elanna Torres. A day when we pay
tribute to her dishonour.

[Real Sickbay]

EMH: She's not responding to the cordrazine.
JANEWAY: Neural activity at forty eight percent, thirty seven.
PARIS: We're losing her.
EMH: We have to stabilise her synaptic functions. I'm attempting a direct
neural resequencing.

[Gre'thor Mess hall]

JANEWAY: B'Elanna's misdeeds have led her to Gre'thor. She comes with no
valour, no glory, nothing to celebrate in song and story.
NEELIX: You really have no one to blame but yourself.
KIM: You've kept us all at arm's length. Even Tom, who you claim to love.
PARIS: Hear, hear.
SEVEN: I tried to assist you in making Engineering more efficient, but
you resisted. You're stubborn.
EMH: She inherited that from her mother, along with the forehead.
CHAKOTAY: What do you think of the Afterlife so far?
TORRES: It's not exactly what I had in mind.
CHAKOTAY: Are you interpreting all the symbols? Searching your
subconscious for their meaning?
TUVOK: Lieutenant Torres. Defend yourself.

[Barge of the Dead - below decks]

TORRES: Captain? What are you still doing here? I've released you to
Sto-Vo-Kor.
MIRAL: You can't free me until you free yourself.
TORRES: I don't understand.
MIRAL: You never did.
TORRES: I did everything that the ritual told me to do. I came back for
you.
MIRAL: Forget the ritual. It's meaningless.
TORRES: Meaningless? I died for you.
MIRAL: No, you didn't, it's not your time. You still don't understand
this journey.
TORRES: Then tell me.
MIRAL: Request denied.
TORRES: What do you want?
MIRAL: Who are you asking?
TORRES: You, Kahless, the tooth fairy. Anybody who will tell me what I am
supposed to do!
MIRAL: You are the only one who can answer that question. Choose to live,
B'Elanna.

[Sickbay]

PARIS: Neural activity's at twenty three percent.
EMH: Initiate cortical stimulation. Pulses at fifty millijoules.
PARIS: No effect.
EMH: Increase to seventy millijoules.
JANEWAY: Come on, B'Elanna.

[Barge of the Dead - on deck]

TUVOK: Defend yourself.
TORRES: You want me to fight? You want me to be a good little Klingon? Is
that it?
JANEWAY: You've let your anger consume you. Now it's consuming us.
SEVEN: She's condemned us all.
EMH: Misery loves company.
TORRES: Get away from me!
KIM: Or what? You'll kill us where we stand?
TORRES: Tell me what you want me to be! A good Starfleet officer? A good
Maquis? Lover? Daughter? Just tell me what you want from me!
MIRAL: We don't want anything from you, B'Elanna.
JANEWAY: We only want you.
NEELIX: We're not your enemies.
PARIS: Defend yourself.
TORRES: I don't know how. I'm so tired of fighting.
JANEWAY: We know.
MIRAL: You've taken the first step of your journey.
TORRES: And what about you?
MIRAL: We will see each other again.
TORRES: In Sto-Vo-Kor.
MIRAL: Yes, in Sto-Vo-Kor, or maybe, when you get home.

[Sickbay]

TORRES: Mother? Oh, god, I'm alive!
JANEWAY: Welcome back.
