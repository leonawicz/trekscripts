Title: Tsunkatse
Stardate: 53447.2
Original Airdate: February 9, 2000


Captain's log, Stardate 53447.2. The crew's enjoying a much-needed shore
leave on the Norcadian homeworld while I visit Pendari, a planet in the
neighbouring system. I'm leaving Commander Chakotay in charge of Voyager.

[Corridor]

JANEWAY: You may want to run a diagnostic on the shield generators. It's
way overdue.
CHAKOTAY: Consider it done.
JANEWAY: And don't forget to keep tabs on Neelix's little project in the
Mess hall.
CHAKOTAY: He's still trying to enhance the plasma burners in his stove?
JANEWAY: With some of Seven's Borg technology. I don't want him
accidentally turning the galley into an assimilation chamber.
CHAKOTAY: I'll assign a security detail to keep tabs on him, unless you
think we need to take more drastic measures.
JANEWAY: And most important, be sure to tell your Captain when she's
being overprotective.
CHAKOTAY: I'll do that.
JANEWAY: Thanks again for minding the store.
CHAKOTAY: Even the Captain deserves a vacation once in a while.
JANEWAY: And her First Officer?
CHAKOTAY: He's looking forward to putting his feet up on your desk.
TORRES: Chakotay!
CHAKOTAY: Fun last night, wasn't it?
TORRES: There's another match scheduled at fifteen hundred.
CHAKOTAY: I've got a systems diagnostic.
TORRES: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're in command until the Captain
gets back.
CHAKOTAY: What's your point?
TORRES: Delegate. I happen to know that Harry's free this afternoon.
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant, you're not suggesting I abuse my power.

[Mess hall]

TORRES: Tell me that's not lunch.
NEELIX; It's leola ointment for my skin.
CHAKOTAY: What happened?
NEELIX: I was so excited to visit one of those beautiful Norcadian
beaches that I forgot to take my dermaline hypospray. I fell asleep under
two suns.
TORRES: Ouch.
NEELIX: A little more colour than I was hoping for, but it'll be a
beautiful amber before you know it. How's your shore leave been?
TORRES: Well, we've spent the last few days at the Tsunkatse matches.
NEELIX: Tsunkatse. I heard some crewmen talking about that during
breakfast.
CHAKOTAY: It's exciting. A real test of strength and agility.
TORRES: You should come to the match with us this afternoon.
SEVEN: From what I've heard, Tsunkatse is crude and pointless.
TORRES: Well I guess we won't be saving you a seat.
CHAKOTAY: What about you, Tuvok? You appreciate the martial arts.
TUVOK: I have other plans. There's a micronebula approximately one point
six light years from here on the verge of collapse.
SEVEN: We'd like to take a shuttle to study it.
NEELIX: An away mission during shore leave?
SEVEN: Commander Tuvok and I don't require recreational activities.
TORRES: The Borg wouldn't know fun if they assimilated an amusement park.
CHAKOTAY: It's your shore leave, but try to enjoy yourselves. That's an
order.

[Cargo Bay two]

PARIS: Here's the navigational data you asked for.
SEVEN; Thank you.
PARIS: How long are you planning on being gone?
SEVEN: Approximately forty eight hours.
PARIS: Just like B'Elanna.
SEVEN: Clarify.
PARIS: She over-packs too.
SEVEN: I haven't over-packed. I simply wish to be prepared for any
contingency.
PARIS: And what contingency is this for?
SEVEN: That's an iso-modulator, enhanced to correct hull ablation in the
event we encounter a meteoroid stream.
PARIS: Couldn't you just replicate an iso-modulator?
SEVEN: I prefer this one.
PARIS: Oh, I get it. You like to have your own things with you.
B'Elanna's the same way. You know, she'd never admit it, but she still
takes a stuffed animal with her whenever she's going to be away for more
than a day. Toby the Targ.
SEVEN: Can Toby the Targ correct hull ablation? Your comparison is flawed.

[Corridor]

EMH: Just the person I was looking for.
SEVEN; You require my assistance?
EMH: Your company. I was wondering if you care to join me on a tour of
Norcadia's cultural hot spots. I hear their museums are among the finest
in this sector.
SEVEN: I'm busy.
EMH: With what?
SEVEN: Commander Tuvok and I are leaving to study a collapsing
micronebula.
EMH: During shore leave? I thought we'd discussed this. Shore leave is a
perfect opportunity for you to spend time with other members of the crew,
to develop your social skills.
SEVEN: Then I suppose I'll have to develop them with Commander Tuvok.
EMH: Vulcans aren't exactly known for their winning personalities.
SEVEN: You'd prefer I spent my time with sociable individuals such as
yourself.
EMH: You could do worse.
SEVEN: In that case, perhaps you'd care to join us.
EMH: To study the micro-nebula?
SEVEN: You can assist us with our analysis of veridium oxide particulates.
EMH: On second thought, you and Tuvok have a good time.
SEVEN: I'll give the Commander your regrets.
EMH: Do that. And if the nebula isn't as riveting as you'd hoped, try to
remember lesson thirty six. Pleasant Parlour Games To Pass The Time.
You'll need it.

[Shuttlecraft]

SEVEN: Two hours, thirty seven minutes, thirteen seconds. That's how long
we've gone without verbal communication.
TUVOK: Why is that remarkable?
SEVEN: The Doctor encourages me to engage in conversation during awkward
silences.
TUVOK: Did you find the silence awkward?
SEVEN: No.
TUVOK: Nor did I.
SEVEN: There's a vessel approaching on an intercept course. The hull
configuration is unfamiliar.
TUVOK: Distance?
SEVEN: Approximately three hundred thousand kilometres.
TUVOK: Hail them.
SEVEN: No response.
TUVOK: Tuvok to Voyager.
SEVEN: The vessel is emitting some kind of dampening field. We've lost
engines, weapons, shields.
TUVOK: It's an explosive device of some sort.
SEVEN: Transporters are down. I can't beam it off.
TUVOK: I'll try to disarm it.

{Tsunkatse living quarters]

PENK: Borg-enhanced physiology. You should possess superior strength,
agility, stamina, and visual acuity. Welcome to Tsunkatse. Since the
game's inception our audience has never had the pleasure of seeing a
drone compete. You are going to be a very popular attraction.
SEVEN: Where is Commander Tuvok?
PENK: Your comrade from the shuttle? I'm afraid he was injured in the
explosion.
SEVEN: I wish to see him. Now.
PENK: Certainly. You'll learn nothing is more important to me than the
comfort and happiness of my fighters.
HIROGEN: Yes, Penk's generosity is legendary.
PENK: Quiet! He's envious because I've found a new favourite.
SEVEN: I have no intention of participating in your game.
PENK: Aggressive. I like that.
SEVEN: He requires medical attention.
PENK: That can be arranged.
SEVEN: Then arrange it.
PENK: You haven't won a single bout, and already you're making demands
like a champion.
SEVEN: Will you treat him or not?
PENK: Will you fight?
TUVOK: Do not comply. My condition is not severe.
PENK: Spoken like a true competitor, willing to ignore his injuries for
the sake of the contest. Schedule a bout for him. A Red match against the
Pensarkan.
HIROGEN: A Red match does not end until one of the competitors is killed.
Your friend would not survive.
PENK: But you might.
HIROGEN: Give her a Blue match, Penk. You wouldn't want to lose your new
favourite her first time in the pit.
PENK: Yes. We should start you off slowly.
SEVEN: Treat him and I will comply.

[Mess Hall]

TORRES: What about the seventh match?
CHAKOTAY: I'm picking the Vensiddian.
KIM: He lost his last two times out.
CHAKOTAY: But he's undefeated against left-handed fighters.
PARIS: You should trust him, Harry. Chakotay knows a thing or two about
southpaws.
TORRES: He was twenty three and oh as a light heavyweight.
CHAKOTAY: Twenty three and and one, actually. A Nausican with a mean
right hook.
KIM: You think that's bad? Try taking a Pareses mallet to the ribs.
CHAKOTAY: I didn't know you played.
KIM: Three time Academy champion. Now, that's a tough sport.
CHAKOTAY: I boxed a few Pareses players in my day.
TORRES: And?
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say they went back to playing Pareses squares after
that.
KIM: Oh, is that a challenge, Commander?
CHAKOTAY: I wouldn't want to put my Ops officer out of commission, now,
would I?
KIM: Oh, I can take a punch.
TORRES: Careful, Harry. Legend has it that the Tattooed Terror has put
more men in Sickbay than the Ankaran flu.
PARIS: Yeah, you wouldn't want to bruise your clarinet fingers.
KIM: Hey, you want to go a few rounds, or all you all talk?
PARIS: Any time, any place.
KIM: Oh, you punch like a Ferengi.

[Corridor]

TORRES: I don't care what Harry says. The Pensarkan-Bendali match is too
close to call.
CHAKOTAY: I'll let you know how it turns out.
TORRES: Excuse me?
CHAKOTAY: I rearranged the duty schedules this morning. You've got the
bridge starting at fourteen hundred hours.
TORRES: You're sticking me with that shift so that you can go to the
fight.
CHAKOTAY: I'm delegating.
TORRES: Me and my big mouth.
CHAKOTAY: I thought you'd be pleased that I took your advice.
TORRES: Words fail me. Now remind me. The reason that you have to see
that fight is because?
CHAKOTAY: I'm an anthropologist.
TORRES: What does that have to do with Tsunkatse?
CHAKOTAY: It's a cultural phenomenon.

[Sickbay]

EMH: You're having an allergic reaction to your leola ointment. I hope
you've learned your lesson. Talaxian homeopathy is no substitute for
medical science. This should help with the swelling and discoloration.
NEELIX: Ow.
EMH: But you'll have to stay out of the sun.
NEELIX: But what about the rest of my shore leave?
EMH: I suggest you limit it to indoor activities.
NEELIX: Commander Chakotay and B'Elanna invited me to the Tsunkatse
matches. I guess I'll go.
EMH: I'm disappointed in you, Mister Neelix. Cheering for one individual
to inflict serious injury on another hardly seems like an activity you'd
enjoy.
NEELIX: Well, Commander Chakotay says that it's a wonderful demonstration
of athletic prowess.
EMH: You seem to be forgetting that Commander Chakotay is an aficionado
of boxing, arguably the most barbaric sport in Earth's history. Surely
you can find some way to occupy your free time that doesn't involve alien
fisticuffs.
NEELIX: Do you have any suggestions?
EMH: As a matter of fact, I was planning a visit to the Norcadian Museum
of Entomology this afternoon. There's a fascinating exhibit of beetle
larvae from the equatorial sub-continent. You're welcome to join me.
NEELIX: Hmm, alien bugs, or alien fisticuffs. Oooh, that's a tough one.

[Tsunkatse Arena]

NEELIX: Tsunkat! Tsunkat! You were right, Commander. This is exciting.
Two opponents, alone in the pit, with only their strength and agility to
protect them.
CHAKOTAY: I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
NEELIX: I still don't understand the rules.
CHAKOTAY: It's simple. A Tsunkatse fighter wears a polaron disruptor on
both hands and feet. Each disruptor delivers a bio-plasmic charge when it
comes in contact one of the opponent's target sensors.
NEELIX: So there is strategy involved!
CHAKOTAY: A fighter has to attack his rival's sensors without exposing
his own.
PARIS: Are you two going to talk, or you here to watch?
NEELIX: He looks like he could pick up a shuttlecraft.
KIM: He's a Pendari. They're known for their superior strength.
PARIS: And their bad temper.
KIM: I hear they have a tendency to throw their opponents into the stands.
PARIS: Be ready to duck.
NEELIX: Seven?
KIM: Seven! Seven!
CHAMPION: You're no bigger than a Tarkanian field mouse. Penk's insulting
me by putting you in the pit to face me.
SEVEN: I must warn you. I possess superior strength.
CHAMPION: I'm trembling.
KIM: Seven! Seven!
NEELIX: Seven!
SEVEN: I assure you, resistance is futile.
CHAMPION: So is all your talk.
NEELIX: Seven!
PARIS: It's no use. She can't hear us.
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager.

[Bridge]

CHAKOTAY [OC]: Come in!
TORRES: Calling to give me a blow-by-blow description of the match,
Commander?
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Seven of Nine is in the pit!
TORRES: What?
CHAKOTAY [OC]: No time to explain. Beam her out of there!

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

SEVEN: I have no desire to inflict further damage.
CHAMPION: I'm afraid I can't say the same

[Bridge]

TORRES: I'm locked onto the co-ordinates of the pit. Seven's not there.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: I'm looking right at her!
TORRES: Not according to these sensors.

[Tsunkatse Arena]

KIM: Maybe their life signs are masked.
CHAKOTAY: Try recalibrating the bio-scanners.

[Bridge]

TORRES: Acknowledged.

[Tsunkatse Arena]

TORRES [OC]: There's nothing to lock onto. The only readings I'm picking
up are photonic.
KIM: Holograms?
PARIS: They're transmitting the fight from another location.

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

PENK: Transmission to one of the arenas on Norcadia Prime is being
disrupted. Compensate.

[Tsunkatse Arena]

CROWD: Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
CHAKOTAY: Voyager, four to beam up.

[Delta Flyer]

CHAKOTAY [OC]: We've scanned the Norcadian surface, Captain. There's no
sign of them.
JANEWAY: Any luck tracing the transmission?
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We're trying, but it's not easy.

[Bridge]

CHAKOTAY: There are transmissions being sent to every planet in the
sector.
JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: I guess you aren't the only ones who enjoy this
sport.
TORRES: It could take days before we figure out where Seven and Tuvok are
being held.
JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: What about diplomatic channels?
CHAKOTAY: Neelix is meeting with a group of Norcadian officials.
JANEWAY: Well, let's hope he gets their co-operation.
CHAKOTAY: When can we expect you back?
JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: I'm at the outer rim of the Pendari system. At
best, I'm forty eight hours away.
CHAKOTAY: Sorry to cut your vacation short.
JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: That's okay, Commander. Keep me informed.
Janeway out.

{Tsunkatse living quarters]

SEVEN: Stay away from me.
HIROGEN: It's a dermal regenerator. The Pendari you fought injured you.
Now, keep still. It's almost out of power.
SEVEN: I prefer that you use it to treat Commander Tuvok.
HIROGEN: I already have. He's sleeping.
SEVEN: Why are you helping us?
HIROGEN: I recognise fellow Hunters when I see them.
SEVEN: I'm no hunter.
HIROGEN: I saw your match today. Your skills are impressive.
SEVEN: The Pendari would disagree.
HIROGEN: You almost defeated him but at the last moment, you hesitated.
You questioned your desire to destroy your prey.
SEVEN: I have no such desire.
HIROGEN: Don't you? I thought I saw it in your eyes. With the proper
training you could become a champion.
SEVEN: Until our ship comes to rescue us, my only goal is to survive.
HIROGEN: Do you know the difference between a survivor and a Champion
here? There isn't one.
PENK: I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
SEVEN: I lost.
PENK: Exactly. There's a great deal of hostility toward the Borg in this
sector. Whenever the Pendari landed a blow, our audience grew. We're
getting tens of thousands of requests to see you fight again.
HIROGEN: She needs time to recuperate, to prepare for her next bout.
PENK: I agree. There's a Red match scheduled for the day after tomorrow.
The Pendari was supposed to compete, but I've entered you in his place.
If three billion people paid to see you hurt, imagine how many will pay
to see you die.
SEVEN: Survival may be more difficult than I imagined.
HIROGEN: You will win the match.
SEVEN: What makes you say that?
HIROGEN: I know your opponent. I know his weaknesses. I can train you to
defeat him.
SEVEN: I told you. I will not kill anyone in that arena.
HIROGEN: Consider the alternative.
SEVEN: Teach me.

HIROGEN: You're letting your elbow fall, exposing your target.
SEVEN: You're mistaken. My arm is positioned properly. When executing the
Tanyk Defence, the blocking elbow must remain parallel to the median
sensor.
HIROGEN: Ah, The Book of Tsunkatse.
SEVEN: Commander Tuvok borrowed it from one of the other fighters.
HIROGEN: It is obvious you've studied it well.
SEVEN: I'm attempting a defence against any, augh! That was not one of
the thirty three sanctioned manoeuvres.
HIROGEN: There must be thirty four.
SEVEN: I was unprepared for your attack.
HIROGEN: Is that what you're going to say to your opponent? Stop thinking
like a drone! Sanctioned maneuvers, perfecting defences. You cannot
assimilate Tsunkatse from a book. You must live it, feel it, in here.
Your movements must become instinct. An attack can come at any time from
any direction. You must learn to improvise.
SEVEN: Like this? I've observed you often favour your left side.
HIROGEN: Very perceptive. It's a wound I sustained in one of my first
matches. After nineteen years, it still hasn't healed properly.
SEVEN: You've been here a long time.
HIROGEN: I was taken during my son's first hunt. He was so proud to be
with his father. Watching every movement I made, imitating my gestures.
But instead of bringing home his first trophy, he saw his father become
someone else's Prey.
SEVEN: Do you know what happened to him?
HIROGEN: I never saw him again. All Penk would say was that the boy was
too small for competition.
SEVEN: Perhaps he managed to return home.
HIROGEN: You let down your defences. Why?
SEVEN: I was
HIROGEN: What? Feeling sorry for me? My tragic past?
SEVEN: Yes.
HIROGEN: You must never sympathise with your prey. Unless you accept
that, you will die. We'll continue.

[Transporter room]

CHAKOTAY: How did it go?
NEELIX: Oh, the Norcadians were shocked to learn that off-worlders might
be participating against their will.

[Corridor]

NEELIX: The Ambassador promised to begin an immediate investigation.
CHAKOTAY: You don't sound too convinced.
NEELIX: I'm not. I spoke to one of the Pendari delegates. According to
him, a huge percentage of the planet's revenue is derived from Tsunkatse.
Nobody wants to do anything that might interfere with the game.
CHAKOTAY: So they turn a blind eye to the recruitment tactics.
NEELIX: We're not going to get any help through official channels. It's
hard to believe, a civilisation whose favourite pastime is cheering while
innocent people fight each other.

[Turbolift]

CHAKOTAY: If Seven and Tuvok hadn't been abducted, we might still be
cheering too.

[Astrometrics lab]

CHAKOTAY: What have you got?
TORRES: Well, one of the reasons we were having trouble isolating the
source of the transmissions was because they never seem to be coming from
the same place twice. At first we thought the matches were being held in
various locations.
KIM: But when we connected the dots, we realised that the pattern
conformed to a flight path.
TORRES: One that spanned the entire sector.
CHAKOTAY: They're transmitting the fights from a ship.
NEELIX: Like a travelling carnival.
KIM: Oh, this is no carnival. Five million metric tons. Reinforced hull
plating protected by covariant shielding. Neutronic weaponry.
TORRES: It's way out of our weight class.
CHAKOTAY: The bigger they come, Lieutenant. Transmit these co-ordinates
to the Captain. Tell her we could use a hand.

{Tsunkatse living quarters]

HIROGEN: Excellent. When your opponent enters the arena what do you see?
SEVEN: My prey.
HIROGEN: And what do you do to your prey?
SEVEN: Hunt it down and kill it.
HIROGEN: Go rest before your match.
SEVEN: Thank you.
HIROGEN: Thank me by winning.
SEVEN: Penk's guards are making their inspection rounds. Progress?
TUVOK: Both the dampening field and the shielding of this vessel are
tetrion-based, but without access to the control interface I can't
disable either. Your training?
SEVEN: Complete.
TUVOK: Are you adequately prepared?
SEVEN: The Hirogen is an efficient instructor. He believes I'll win.
TUVOK: That troubles you.
SEVEN: The idea of killing someone for the entertainment of others is
detestable.
TUVOK: Is the idea of losing your own life for the entertainment of
others more palatable? As a drone you took many lives.
SEVEN: I was acting as part of the Collective.
TUVOK: You're worried you won't have the strength to accomplish the task
on your own.
SEVEN: I'm worried that I will.
PENK: It's time.
TUVOK: Do whatever it takes to survive.

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

SEVEN: You knew.
HIROGEN: Yes.
SEVEN: Training me was a deception. You wished to familiarise yourself
with my weaknesses.
HIROGEN: I was helping you to overcome them.
SEVEN: Why?
HIROGEN: Nineteen years is a long time. I've grown tired.
SEVEN: You wish to be killed in the arena.
HIROGEN: I want a death my son would be proud of.
SEVEN: I won't be the one to provide it.
HIROGEN: Then I'll be forced to kill you.

[Bridge]

PARIS: Approaching the vessel.
CHAKOTAY: Take us out of warp. Raise shields and charge weapons. Any sign
of Tuvok and Seven?
KIM: Our sensors can't penetrate their shields.
CHAKOTAY: Hail them.
PENK [on viewscreen]: This is not a convenient time.
CHAKOTAY: I'm Commander Chakotay of the Starship Voyager. You're holding
two of my people.
PENK [on viewscreen]: You'll have to be more specific.
CHAKOTAY: Commander Tuvok and Seven of Nine. Return them. Now.
PENK [on viewscreen]: The Borg drone and her friend. I'm afraid she's
occupied at the moment.
CHAKOTAY: You have thirty seconds before I open fire.
PENK: A fighter. I respect that, but you're no match for me.

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

SEVEN: We can still find another way out of this.
HIROGEN: There is no other way. You're still dropping your elbow. Make a
choice. Hunter or Prey? Hunter or Prey?

[Bridge]

TORRES: Direct hit to their aft shield generators.
KIM: Still no sign of Seven, but I've got a lock on Tuvok.
CHAKOTAY: Beam him to Sickbay. Keep targeting those generators.
KIM: Transport complete.
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Tuvok.
TUVOK [OC]: Go ahead, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: Do you know Seven's status?

[Sickbay]

TUVOK: She's being forced to fight to the death. I believe they're on the
uppermost deck.
[Bridge]

KIM: That section's protected by multi-phasic force fields. I can't
penetrate them.
TORRES: Shields down to forty percent. Thirty two percent.

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

HIROGEN: You're getting weak. I should have found worthier prey. You're
imperfect. Is that the best you can do?

[Bridge]

TORRES: Shields are down.
CHAKOTAY: Evasive manoeuvres. Harry?
KIM: Still can't get a lock.
PARIS: Should I get us out of here before they knock out our propulsion?
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. If we can't beam her out, maybe we can shut down the
transmission.
PARIS: If nobody's watching, then why continue the fight?
CHAKOTAY: Start targeting their signal generators.
KIM: Hull breach on deck eleven.
CHAKOTAY: Seal it!
TORRES: We've lost weapons.
PARIS: Another vessel is approaching.
TORRES: Great. Now they're bringing in reinforcements.
PARIS: No, this one's on our side. It's the Delta Flyer.

[Delta Flyer]

CHAKOTAY [OC]: Good to see you, Captain.
JANEWAY: Nothing like getting back to work after a long vacation.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We need you to target their signal generators.
JANEWAY: Understood.

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

PENK: We've lost more than half our audience. Reroute power to
transmitters five and six.

[Bridge]

KIM: They've reduced power to their force fields. I've got two life signs
in there. Seven and a Hirogen but I can't get an individual lock.
CHAKOTAY: Transport them both if you have to. Tom.
PARIS: Aye, sir.

[Tsunkatse combat pit]

HIROGEN: Never let your prey suffer. Kill it.

[Transporter room]

PARIS: Seven, stand away.
SEVEN: It's all right. This fight is over.

Captain's Log, Stardate 53529.4. We've resumed course for the Alpha
quadrant and initiated repairs. I can't say I'm sorry to see this shore
leave come to an end.

[Sickbay]

CHAKOTAY: We've located an Hirogen hunting party three light years away.
They've agreed to rendezvous with us.
HIROGEN; I'm grateful.
SEVEN: Would you excuse us?
EMH: Very well. But if you should need anything an analgesic, a phaser
rifle, don't hesitate to ask.
SEVEN: I apologise for the Doctor. He's very protective of me.
HIROGEN: He doesn't realise how well you defend yourself. A trophy.
SEVEN: What will do you now, search for new prey?
HIROGEN: No, this time I will be searching for my son.
SEVEN: If he is as clever as his father, he may be difficult to locate.
HIROGEN: I've been wondering. Would you have killed me?
SEVEN: I don't know.
HIROGEN: Fortunately, you were right. There was another way out.

[Astrometrics lab]

TUVOK: I thought you might require assistance.
SEVEN: Thank you.
TUVOK: I realise we share an affinity for silences, but in this instance
I feel compelled to speak. If you hadn't offered to take my place in the
arena it's likely I would have been killed.
SEVEN: I made the logical choice, as you would have.
TUVOK: Still, I owe you a debt of gratitude.
SEVEN: Assisting me with these recalibrations will be sufficient thanks.
TUVOK: Have you fully recovered?
SEVEN: I'm experiencing minor pain beneath my occipital implant, but the
Doctor believes it is temporary.
TUVOK: I wasn't referring to your physical condition.
SEVEN: When the Hirogen referred to me as weak, he was correct.
TUVOK: But you overpowered him.
SEVEN: Because I lost control.
TUVOK: Given the circumstances, your behaviour was understandable.
SEVEN: I've spent the last three years struggling to regain my humanity.
I'm afraid I may have lost it again in that arena.
TUVOK: You're experiencing difficult emotions.
SEVEN: Guilt, shame, remorse.
TUVOK: Then you haven't lost your humanity. You have reaffirmed it.
