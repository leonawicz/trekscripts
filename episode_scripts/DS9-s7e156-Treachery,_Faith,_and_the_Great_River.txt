	FADE IN:

1    INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON KIRA

	She's lying facedown on her bed, her neck and bare 
	shoulders exposed. Her head stirs slightly against 
	the pillow as she reacts to a pleasant sensation.

					KIRA 
			A little lower... lower... 
			lower...

2    CLOSE ON ODO

	He sits beside her on the bed, his upper arms moving 
	rhythmically. We can tell that he's giving her a 
	back rub.

					ODO
			How's that?

					KIRA
				(perfect) 
			Mmmm.

3    REVEAL BOTH (OPTICAL)

	We can see that Odo has MORPHED his hands into two 
	glistening POOLS of soothing SHAPE-SHIFTER GOO, which 
	he manipulates over Kira's exposed back.

					ODO 
			I hope this taught you a lesson.

					KIRA
				(eyes closed) 
			What's that?

					ODO
			Never play springball against a 
			changeling.

					KIRA
			Just for that, next time I'm not 
			going to let you win a single 
			game.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER       2.

3    CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			Then you'd better work on your 
			backhand.

					KIRA
			Right now, all I want to do is 
			sleep for two or three... days.

					ODO
			Go right ahead, I should be back 
			by the time you wake up.

					KIRA
				(still floating) 
			Back? From where?

					ODO 
			I received a coded message from 
			Gul Russol this morning.

	Kira opens her eyes and looks around at Odo. The 
	mood is broken and Odo MORPHS his hands back to 
	normal.

					KIRA 
			Gul Russol? I thought he was 
			executed when Cardassia joined 
			the Dominion.

					ODO
			So did I. But apparently, we 
			were wrong. The message says he 
			wants to meet with me.

					KIRA
			Why?


					ODO 
			I don't know, but he's my most 
			reliable Cardassian informant.

					KIRA
			You mean "was." What if Russol 
			is dead and this is a trap?

					ODO
			I've thought about that, but I 
			have to be sure myself. I owe 
			him that much.

	Kira can see that Odo's made up his mind.


 DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER       3.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA 
			You want me to go with you?

					ODO
			Russol insists I come alone.

	Kira doesn't like hearing that.

					ODO 
			Don't worry, Nerys. I'll be 
			careful.

	Kira looks over at Odo for a beat, then gives him a 
	smile of support.

					KIRA 
			Who's worried? This gives me 
			more time to work on my  
			backhand.

	And off that...

4    INT. PROMENADE

	The entire area in front of Quark's has been 
	cordoned off. At several open panels, O'BRIEN, NOG 
	and a couple of STARFLEET ENGINEERS are waist-deep
	in an array of spaghetti-like plasma tubes that have 
	been pulled out for repair. In short, the place is 
	a mess. O'Brien seems frustrated and overwhelmed.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER       4.

4    CONTINUED:

	An angry QUARK approaches.

					QUARK 
			Chief -- how much longer is the 
			Promenade going to be closed? My 
			bar is empty, my waiters are 
			bored and I'm losing money.

					O'BRIEN
			Leave me alone, Quark -- or I'll 
			feed you to one of these plasma 
			conductors.

					QUARK
			Are you threatening me?

					NOG 
			We're working as fast as we can.

					QUARK
				(to O'Brien) 
			As spokesman of the Promenade 
			Merchant's Association, I'm going 
			to file an official protest with 
			Captain Sisko.

					SISKO (O.S.) 
			Put it in writing, Quark.

5    OMITTED

6    NEW ANGLE

	to include CAPTAIN SISKO approaching the group.

	Quark can see that Sisko is in no mood to hear 
	further arguments on the subject.

					QUARK
			I'll go find a PADD.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER       5.

6    CONTINUED:

	And with that, Quark makes a hasty retreat.

7    ANGLE ON SISKO

	turning his attention to O'Brien.

					SISKO
			So how much longer, Chief?

					O'BRIEN 
			We should be done here by the end 
			of the day.

					SISKO
			I'm not talking about the 
			Promenade -- I'm talking about 
			the Defiant. When are you going 
			to get the gravity net repaired? 
			The last time I stepped onto the 
			bridge, I felt ten kilos heavier.

	This is the last thing O'Brien wants to hear; he has 
	enough problems already.

					O'BRIEN 
			I'm afraid it's going to take 
			some time, sir.

					SISKO
			How much time?

					O'BRIEN 
			About three weeks. The graviton 
			stabilizer has to be replaced.

					SISKO
			You have three days. The 
			Defiant's going back out on 
			patrol, and I don't want my crew 
			getting queasy because the 
			gravity keeps fluctuating.

					O'BRIEN 
			But, sir -- the sector 
			quartermaster said it's going to 
			take him three weeks to get us a 
			new stabilizer.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER     6-7.

7    CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			That's your problem, Chief. I'm 
			leaving for a conference on Bajor 
			and I want the stabilizer 
			replaced by the time I get back. 
			Do I make myself clear?

					O'BRIEN
			Yes, sir.

	And with that, Sisko turns and EXITS.

8    ANGLE ON O'BRIEN

	as he watches the captain walk away. Nog, who's 
	been listening, steps up alongside O'Brien.

					NOG 
			I don't want to sound negative, 
			but I don't see how you can have 
			the Defiant ready in three days.

					O'BRIEN
			Neither do I...

	Nog puts his grey cells into overdrive.

					NOG 
			This quartermaster you've been 
			dealing with -- what's his name?

					O'BRIEN
			Chief...
				(has to think for a 
				beat)
			...Willoughby.

					NOG
			I mean his first name.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER       8.

8    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
				(failing to see the 
				relevance) 
			I don't know...

					NOG 
			Is he married?

					O'BRIEN 
			Married? What does that have to 
			do with getting a graviton 
			stabilizer?

					NOG 
			Everything. Chief Willoughby 
			must get hundreds of supply 
			requisitions every day. He can't 
			possibly fill them all. So he 
			puts everyone on a waiting list.

					O'BRIEN
			I know how he feels. I have to 
			do the same thing.

					NOG 
			The secret is getting him to put 
			you at the top of that list. And 
			the best way to do that is to 
			form a relationship with him -- 
			get to know the name of his wife, 
			his children, find out what he 
			likes to eat...

					O'BRIEN
				(dubious) 
			I don't have time to "form a 
			relationship" with Willoughby.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER       9.

8    CONTINUED:	(2)

					NOG
			I do.
				(a beat) 
			I can get you that stabilizer, 
			Chief.

					O'BRIEN
			In three days?

					NOG
			Leave everything to me.

	O'Brien thinks this over a bit, can't see another 
	option.

					O'BRIEN 
			All right, just don't do anything 
			I wouldn't do.

					NOG 
				(serious) 
			Chief, I can't operate under 
			those kinds of restrictions.

					O'BRIEN
				(resigned) 
			At least promise me you won't do 
			anything to get us court 
			martialed.


					NOG
			I'll try.

					O'BRIEN
			Nog!

					NOG
			Just kidding, Chief.

	And with that, Nog tries to wade his way out of the 
	maze of plasma tubes.

9    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)

	The Runabout orbits a small barren moon.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER      9A.

10   INT. CAVE

	Beneath the moon's surface. It's dark, the only 
	light coming from above. Odo ENTERS holding a hand 
	beacon. He begins searching the cave.

					ODO
			Russol? Russol...

	Behind Odo, a FIGURE steps out of the shadows. It's 
	WEYOUN.

					WEYOUN
			I'm afraid he couldn't be here.

	Odo turns to see the Vorta.

					ODO
			Weyoun...

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER      10.

10   CONTINUED:

	Weyoun lowers his head reverentially.

					WEYOUN 
			Founder... it is an honor to 
			stand in your presence once 
			again.

					ODO 
			Where's Gul Russol?

					WEYOUN 
			I'm afraid the Cardassian Central 
			Command had him put to death 
			almost a year ago. I regret 
			having to deceive you, but it was 
			the only way I could think of to 
			get you here.

					ODO
				(looking around the 
				cavern) 
			Well, I'm here. What do you 
			want?

					WEYOUN
				(tilts his head 
				deferentially) 
			To serve you. I no longer 
			consider myself a member of the 
			Dominion.

					ODO
				(surprised) 
			You're defecting?

					WEYOUN 
			Do with me as you wish.
				(bowing) 
			I place my fate entirely in your 
			hands.

	Weyoun then looks up at Odo, gazing up at him with a 
	mix of reverence, hope and fear.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - TEASER      11.

11   ON ODO

	disturbed by Weyoun's apparent sincerity. And off 
	that, we:

									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER                          


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE     12.
                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)

12   INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

	As before. Weyoun can see that Odo remains somewhat 
	skeptical.

					WEYOUN
				(disappointed) 
			You don't believe me, do you?

					ODO
			I believe Gul Russol is dead. 
			You say you're defecting from the 
			Dominion. Why?

					WEYOUN 
			Founder... please --


					ODO
			I've told you before -- I'm not a 
			Founder.

					WEYOUN 
			As you wish...
				(trying it out)
			... Odo. I'll tell you everything 
			you want to know -- but first, we 
			really should get aboard your 
			runabout. The Jem'Hadar are 
			already hunting for me and if I'm 
			found...

					ODO
			You haven't answered my question. 
			Why did you decide to defect?

					WEYOUN 
			I realized my place is with you.

					ODO
			You can do better than that.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE     13.

12   CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN 
			Then let's just say I left 
			Cardassia because my life was in 
			danger.

					ODO
			From whom?

					WEYOUN 
			Everyone.

					ODO
			Aren't you being a little 
			paranoid?

					WEYOUN 
			Of course I'm paranoid -- 
			everyone's trying to kill me.

					ODO
			Why?

					WEYOUN 
			Because this war with the 
			Federation was supposed to have 
			been won months ago.

					ODO
			Things don't always turn out as 
			planned.

					WEYOUN 
			Quite true. And when things go 
			wrong, someone has to take the 
			blame. And this time, it's me.
				(looking over his 
				shoulder) 
			Now we really should be going...

	Odo thinks about the situation for a moment.

					WEYOUN 
			Think about it, Odo. The 
			information I possess could help 
			the Federation win this war.

					ODO
			And you're willing to share that 
			information.

					WEYOUN 
			All you have to do is ask.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE     14.

13   CLOSER (OPTICAL)

	Odo applies a quick test:

					ODO 
			We've heard rumors that the 
			Dominion has established a new 
			Ketracel White storage facility 
			somewhere in Sector Five-Zero-
			Seven.

					WEYOUN 
			The facility is located in the 
			Pelosa system. I can supply you 
			with the exact coordinates.

	No matter how suspicious Odo may be of Weyoun, it's 
	an offer he can't refuse.

					ODO
				(tapping his
				combadge)
			Odo to the Rio Grande. Two to
			beam up.

	And as Odo and Weyoun DEMATERIALIZE, we go to --

14   EXT. SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)

	In orbit around the moon.

15   INT. RUNABOUT

	Odo heads for the pilot's chair. Weyoun is 
	obviously relieved to be on the runabout and headed 
	for safety. Odo immediately points to the empty 
	seat next to him.

					ODO 
			Sit here -- where I can keep an 
			eye on you.

	Weyoun does as he's told.

					WEYOUN 
			If it makes you feel better. But 
			you should know I would never 
			harm a god.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE    14A.

15   CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			I'm not a god -- I'm a security 
			officer. And as far as I'm 
			concerned, you're just another 
			prisoner.

					WEYOUN
			You have no idea how much it 
			hurts me to hear you say that.

	Odo continues to work his console as Weyoun settles 
	into the copilot's seat.

16   INT. PROMENADE

	Late night. The Promenade is deserted as an 
	exhausted O'Brien closes up the last panel.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE     15.

16   CONTINUED:

	The "mess" of plasma tubes has been completely 
	cleaned up.

17   NEW ANGLE

	to see an excited Nog approach.

					NOG 
			I spoke to Edgar.

					O'BRIEN
			Edgar who?

					NOG 
			Your new best friend, Chief Edgar 
			Willoughby. He wanted me to 
			thank you for that bottle of 
			Gamzian wine you sent him.

					O'BRIEN 
			I didn't send him any wine.


					NOG 
			I took the liberty of sending it 
			for you. By the way, his wife's 
			name is Cynthia. They have a 
			daughter, Melissa, age eight and 
			a son, Edgar Junior. Age five.

	O'Brien brightens at the prospect

					O'BRIEN 
			You got the stabilizer?

					NOG 
			Not quite.

					O'BRIEN 
			What do you mean, "not quite?"

					NOG 
			Unfortunately, he's out of 
			stabilizers and he won't be 
			getting a new shipment for 
			another week.

					O'BRIEN
				(crestfallen) 
			That's it, then -- I'm doomed.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE     16.

17   CONTINUED:

					NOG 
			Not necessarily. Eddie told me 
			the USS Sentinel has an extra 
			stabilizer.

					O'BRIEN
			What makes you think they're 
			going to give it to us?

					NOG 
			I didn't say they were going to 
			give it to us. But they might be 
			willing to trade for it.

					O'BRIEN
			Trade what?

					NOG 
			Depends on what they need and 
			what we have.


					O'BRIEN
			I suppose it doesn't hurt to try.
				(decides) 
			Just remember to use discretion.

					NOG
				(agreeing) 
			Rule of Acquisition one sixty-
			eight: "Whisper your way to 
			success."

					O'BRIEN 
			Words to live by.

	Nog begins to walk away, then realizes he's 
	forgotten something --

					NOG 
			Oh, Chief, one more thing --

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT ONE    16A.

17   CONTINUED:	(2)

	Nog holds out a PADD for O'Brien.

					NOG 
			I need your authorization code.

					O'BRIEN
				(balks) 
			What for?

					NOG 
			The shipping orders.

					O'BRIEN 
			Why don't you just bring them to 
			me and I'll authorize them?

					NOG
				(shrugs) 
			I just thought it would save 
			time.
				(beat) 
			When did you say the captain was 
			going to be back?

	O'Brien sighs and taps a few keys on the PADD.

					NOG 
			Stop looking so worried, Chief. 
			I've got it all under control.

	And with that, Nog walks away. We HOLD on O'Brien 
	who still looks as concerned as ever.

					O'BRIEN
				(to himself)
			I sure hope so...

19   INT. RUNABOUT

	Hours later. Odo continues to pilot the runabout, 
	but he's aware that Weyoun is staring at him with a 
	disturbing look of serenity.

					ODO
			I wish you'd stop doing that.

					WEYOUN
			Doing what?

					ODO
			Staring at me.

					WEYOUN
			Was I? I didn't mean to.

					ODO
			You've been doing it for the past
			ten hours.

					WEYOUN
			I'm sorry. It's just such an
			honor to be sitting here with a --

	Odo shoots him a glare.

					WEYOUN
			-- security officer.

	But before Odo can reply, something catches his 
	attention off his console.

					ODO
			We're being hailed.

					WEYOUN
			Don't respond.

					ODO
			It's a Cardassian transmission.

20   ANOTHER ANGLE (VPB)

	as Weyoun leans forward with apprehension.

					WEYOUN 
			Scramble the com frequencies so 
			they can't lock onto us.

					ODO
			I'm trying...

	Suddenly, the CARDASSIAN LOGO appears on all the 
	monitors.

	image of Weyoun and DAMAR, standing side by side, in 
	the Dominion briefing room.

22   ANGLE ON ODO

	staring at the image of Weyoun with stunned surprise.

					WEYOUN
				(on the monitor) 
			Founder. It's an honor to speak

	Odo looks to his prisoner, then back at the monitor; 
	trying to make sense of what he sees. And as Odo

	FADE IN:

23   INT. RUNABOUT - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)

	As before. The two Weyouns stare at each other with 
	undisguised loathing. (Note: from here on, the 
	Weyoun on the runabout with Odo will be referred to 
	as WV-Six, while the Weyoun in the Dominion briefing 
	room will be known simply as Weyoun.)

					WEYOUN 
			You look surprised to see me, Odo.

					ODO
			I'm well aware that all Vortas 
			are clones. But I'm not sure the 
			universe is ready for two 
			Weyouns...

					WEYOUN 
			I couldn't agree more.

	Odo looks from one Weyoun to the other.

					ODO 
			So which of you is the Weyoun 
			I've had the misfortune of 
			dealing with over the past few 
			years?

					WV-SIX 
			Actually, neither of us.

					WEYOUN
			That was Weyoun Five. Our 
			illustrious predecessor was 
			killed a month ago.

	The two Weyouns engage in a subtle game of one-upmanship.

					WV-SIX 
			And I had the honor of replacing 
			him.

					WEYOUN
			What a sad day that was for the 
			Dominion.
				(implying that WV-Six is not) 
			Weyoun Five was a great man. A 
			true patriot.
				(to Odo) 
			His death in a transporter 
			"accident" was most unfortunate.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO     21.

23   CONTINUED: 

					WV-SIX
				(pointed) 
			And still under investigation.


	Damar is aware that both Weyouns consider him under 
	suspicion.

					DAMAR
				(defensive) 
			A very thorough investigation 
			that has found no evidence of 
			foul play.

					ODO 
			Interesting...
				(sorting it out, to 
				WV-Six) 
			So if you're Weyoun Six...
				(to Weyoun)
			... you must be Seven.

									INTERCUT:

24   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM

	We continue the conversation, except now Odo and WV-
	Six appear on Weyoun and Damar's wall monitor.

					DAMAR
				(with disgust) 
			Clones... keeping track of them 
			is a full time job.

					ODO
				(to Weyoun) 
			Why were you activated if...
				(indicates WV-Six)
			... he's still alive?

					WEYOUN 
			Normally, I wouldn't have been. 
			But when a clone is found to be 
			defective...

					WV-SIX
				(adamant) 
			I'm not defective!

					WEYOUN 
			Of course you are. What other 
			explanation can there be for your 
			behavior? Leaving your post... 
			defecting to the enemy.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO    21A.

24   CONTINUED:

					WV-SIX
				(striking a blow)
			Are you calling Odo -- your
			enemy?

					WEYOUN
				(a quick retraction)
			Absolutely not. I was referring
			to the Federation --
				(to WV-Six)
			-- as you're well aware.

	Damar's had enough of all this.

					DAMAR
			Enough bickering.
				(to Weyoun, re: WV-
				Six)
			Order him to trigger his implant.

					WEYOUN
			I was getting to that.

					ODO
			What implant?

					WV-SIX
			Like all Vorta, I have a
			termination implant in my brain
			stem.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO     22.

24   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WEYOUN
				(to WV-Six) 
			Prove your loyalty to the 
			Founders. Activate it.

					WV-SIX 
			The only Founder I'm loyal to is 
			Odo -- and he wants me alive.

					DAMAR
				(losing patience) 
			I told you it was a waste of time 
			to try to reason with him.
				(to WV-Six) 
			You're a dead man whether you 
			activate that implant or not. 
			That ship will never make it back 
			to Deep Space Nine.

					WEYOUN 
			Founder, there's no need for you 
			to be involved in this petty 
			dispute. If you'll just hold 
			your position until one of our 
			ships can reach you...

					ODO
			I have no intention of releasing 
			my prisoner to you.

	This is Weyoun's worst nightmare. He's in a no-win 
	situation and he knows it. His voice tightens.

					WEYOUN 
			If you don't, I can't be 
			responsible for the consequences.

					WV-SIX
				(to Odo) 
			It's an empty threat. He 
			wouldn't dare harm a Founder.

					DAMAR 
			Maybe he won't, but I will. 
			Think it over, Shape-shifter. One 
			of our attack ships is on the 
			way.

	Damar BREAKS THE TRANSMISSION.

									END INTERCUT.

25   INT. RUNABOUT - CONTINUOUS

	to see Odo sit back in his chair, considering their 
	situation. WV-Six bows his head in shame.

					WV-SIX 
			Forgive me, Odo... I should've 
			told you the truth about myself.

					ODO
			It's not too late to start. Why 
			did you defect?

	WV-Six thinks this over for a beat.

					WV-SIX 
			It's simple really... from the 
			moment I was activated, I felt 
			the war was... wrong. Don't 
			misunderstand me, I still worship 
			the Founders, but I believe their 
			obsession with conquering the 
			Alpha Quadrant is misguided. 
			It's time they learned to live in 
			peace with the Solids.
				(a painful 
				admission) 
			I know it's not my place to 
			question the Founders. Maybe 
			Weyoun Seven is right -- I am 
			defective.

	Odo can't help but be touched by WV-Six's obvious 
	sincerity.

					ODO 
			On the contrary, what you're 
			saying about the war... about the 
			Founders -- makes perfect sense.

	Weyoun smiles at Odo, taking comfort in his words.

					WV-SIX 
			I want to thank you, Odo
			way you stood up for me... 
			protected me...

	WV-Six's devotion makes Odo uncomfortable.

					ODO 
			I wouldn't let it go to your head 
			-- I'd do the same for any 
			prisoner.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO    23A.

25   CONTINUED:

					WV-SIX
			Of course you would, you're a

	Odo can see that further debate is going to lead 
	nowhere and allows his annoyed silence to be his 
	only rebuttal.

27   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM

	Moments later. Weyoun is pacing the room looking 
	deeply troubled. Damar pours himself a glass of 
	kanar, amused by Weyoun's distress.

					WEYOUN 
			To think that a Weyoun could be 
			capable of such treachery.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO     24.

27   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR 
			I knew there was something wrong 
			with him from the moment we met.
				(a beat) 
			He lacked your appetite for 
			cruelty.

					WEYOUN 
			He's a disgrace to me and all 
			Vorta.
				(taking a breath)
			Though, I suppose, he's not
			entirely to blame for his
			behavior. The Vorta cloning
			process is a very delicate one..
			every once in a while a clone is
			found to be... defective. It's
			never happened to a Weyoun
			before, but it does happen.
				(a beat) 
			And speaking of treachery... 
			there is still the little matter 
			of the death of Weyoun Five.

					DAMAR
				(laughing it off) 
			You really believe I had 
			something to do with that?

					WEYOUN 
			You were supposed to be on that 
			transporter pad with him.

	Now it's Damar's turn to sound a bit defensive.

					DAMAR 
			I was called away... an urgent 
			meeting with the Central Command.

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO    24A.

27   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WEYOUN 
			How convenient.

					DAMAR
			I've always been... lucky.

	Damar reaches for the kanar and pours himself 
	another glass.

					DAMAR 
			You sure I can't interest you in 
			a glass of kanar?

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO     25.

27   CONTINUED:	(3)

					WEYOUN 
			I'm afraid our problems won't 
			wash away quite that easily.

					DAMAR 
			I don't see what you're so 
			concerned about... Odo can't hope 
			to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship.

					WEYOUN 
			But what if he refuses to hand 
			over his prisoner?

					DAMAR
				(matter-of-fact) 
			Then he'll die.

	Weyoun is shocked and angry.

					WEYOUN 
			He will not. We can't kill a 
			Founder. I forbid it.

					DAMAR 
			Unless we stop them, Odo is going 
			to take your predecessor back to 
			the Federation where he will 
			undoubtedly tell them all he 
			knows... all you know... about 
			our strategic operations. You 
			realize what that means, don't you?

					WEYOUN
				(a heavy burden)
			It means we could lose the war...

					DAMAR 
			That's right. And I will not 
			allow that to happen. Cardassia 
			has risked too much... suffered 
			too much. I will not stand by 
			and watch all our plans... all 
			our dreams for the future, end in 
			defeat just to spare the life of 
			one Shape-shifter.

					WEYOUN
			I don't believe the Jem'Hadar 
			would fire on Odo, even if they 
			were ordered to...

      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT TWO     26.

27   CONTINUED:	(4)

					DAMAR 
			They don't need to know he's on 
			board. You can simply order them 
			to destroy the runabout.

					WEYOUN
			I suppose it might work...
				(then a alarming 
				thought) 
			But if the Founders ever found 
			out that we were responsible for 
			Odo's death...

					DAMAR
			Who's going to tell them?

					WEYOUN
				(trying to convince 
				himself) 
			Odo doesn't even consider himself 
			a Founder.

					DAMAR 
			Then we agree. The runabout must 
			be destroyed.

	There's a long beat, then Weyoun nods.

					DAMAR 
			Excellent.

	Damar smiles and holds up the bottle of kanar.

					DAMAR
				(smiling) 
			Now, I really think you should 
			try some kanar...

	But Weyoun only scowls and EXITS. Damar relishes 
	his victory as he sips his drink.

					KIRA
			You mind explaining this?

					O'BRIEN
			Where's the captain's desk?

					KIRA
			You mean you don't know?

			This is your authorization code,

					O'BRIEN
				(putting it

					KIRA
			What about him?

					O'BRIEN
			He must've traded the captain's

					KIRA
			Excuse me?

					O'BRIEN 
			Don't worry, colonel. I'll get

			You're damn right you will. The

			So do I.

	And off that moment --

					NOG 
			Al Lorenzo.

					O'BRIEN
			Who's Al Lorenzo?

					NOG 
			The chief of operations on Decos 
			Prime.

					O'BRIEN 
			What does he want with the 
			captain's desk?

					NOG 
			He wants to take a picture of it.

					O'BRIEN
				(baffled) 
			Why?

					NOG 
			He likes to collect holophotos of 
			himself sitting behind the desks 
			of famous Starfleet captains. 
			Usually he just sneaks into their 
			offices. But with the war on, 
			it's hard for him to get away.

32   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN 
			Makes sense.

					NOG 
			He has quite a photo collection -- 
			Captain DeSoto's desk, Captain 
			Picard's --

					O'BRIEN
				(interrupting) 
			Okay. Fine. So once he gets the 
			picture, he's going to send us 
			the stabilizer.

					NOG 
			No, he's giving us an induction 
			modulator.

					O'BRIEN
			But we don't need an induction 
			modulator.

					NOG 
			The USS Musashi does.

					O'BRIEN
				(thinks he 
				understands) 
			Ah, and the Musashi's giving us 
			the stabilizer.

					NOG 
			No, they're giving us a phaser 
			emitter.

					O'BRIEN 
			But we don't need a phaser 
			emitter.

					NOG 
			I know, but the Sentinel does. 
			And they have the extra 
			stabilizer.

					O'BRIEN
			And you think they'll be willing 
			to give it up for the phaser

					NOG 
			The Continuum is real. You see,

			our ship will be filled with

					O'BRIEN
			Right now, I'll settle for a

			forgive me.

					ODO
			Has it ever occurred to you that 
			you believe the Founders are gods 
			because that's what they want you 
			to believe? That they built that 
			into your genetic code?

	But WV-Six refuses to buy Odo's denial, grinning to 
	himself.

					WV-SIX 
			Of course they did. That's what 
			gods do. After all, why be a god 
			if there's no one to worship you? 
				(a beat) 
			I'm hungry. Is it all right if I 
			get something from the 
			replicator?

41   CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			Go right ahead.

	WV-Six gets up and walks back to the replicator. WE 
	HOLD ON Odo, still not sure what to make of this 
	troubled Vorta.

43   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	ROM, who has been working at an open panel, faces an 
	aggravated O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN 
			Rom, where's Nog?

					ROM 
			I don't know, Chief. Nog left 
			the station a couple of hours ago 
			in a runabout.

					O'BRIEN
			Who gave him permission to use a 
			runabout?

					ROM 
			You did.

					O'BRIEN
				(as the coin drops) 
			I never should've given him my 
			authorization code. Did he say 
			when he'd be back?

					ROM 
			Not to me.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE   36A.

43   CONTINUED

					O'BRIEN 
			How could he do this to me? How 
			could he leave me adrift, mid-
			river without a paddle?

					ROM 
			What river would that be?

					O'BRIEN
			You know, the Great Material 
			Continuum.

					ROM 
			Oh. That river. It can be very 
			treacherous.

					O'BRIEN
			Tell me about it. 
				(a beat) 
			I suppose the good news is that 
			with Nog gone, nothing else will 
			go missing...

			Where are my cases of bloodwine?!

45   NEW ANGLE

	to reveal GENERAL MARTOK as he tosses the empty 
	cargo container to the floor, where it joins three 
	others just like it. A perplexed WORF stands beside 
	him, holding a PADD.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE    38.

	Re-establishing.

47   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM

	Weyoun and Damar are looking at the wall monitor 
	displaying the location of the Runabout.

					DAMAR 
				(angry) 
			I don't understand it. How could 
			a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar 
			fighter?

					WEYOUN 
			Isn't it obvious? My predecessor 
			must've helped Odo get past the 
			ship's defenses.

					DAMAR
			Then how do we stop them?

					WEYOUN 
			How else? We send more ships. 
				(looking at the map) 
			A whole squadron, if necessary. 
			From our base at Olmerak.

					DAMAR 
			Consider it done.

	Damar crosses to a console and taps a few keys.

					WEYOUN 
			Remember to tell them to fire on 
			sight.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (O.S.) 
			Fire at whom?

	Weyoun and Damar turn to see --

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE    39.

48   ANGLE ON DOOR

	as the FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER ENTERS the room. They're 
	both surprised and somewhat rattled to see her. 
	Weyoun bows reverentially.

					WEYOUN 
			Founder... how can I serve you?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			By answering my question.

					DAMAR
				(thinking fast) 
			We've spotted a Federation 
			runabout spying on our base in 
			the Olmerak system.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Surely one ship shouldn't be much 
			of a threat...

					WEYOUN 
			We'll have it destroyed within 
			the hour.

	Both Weyoun and Damar notice that the Female 
	Shape-shifter's face seems somewhat dry and 
	desiccated.

					DAMAR
				(to the Female 
				Shape-shifter) 
			Are you feeling all right?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Why do you ask?

					DAMAR 
			Your face...

49   CLOSE ON THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (OPTICAL)

	as she MORPHS the "flakes" off her face.

50   WIDER

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			I'm fine. But from now on, I 
			want the temperature in these 
			rooms lowered by fifteen degrees. 
			I don't share the Cardassians' 
			love of heat.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE    40.

50   CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN 
			Nor do I.
				(to Damar) 
			Lower the temperature.

					DAMAR
				(to the Female 
				Shape-shifter) 
			As you wish.

					WEYOUN
				(to the Female 
				Shape-shifter, 
				solicitous) 
			Is there anything else I can do 
			for you?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			Have you located Weyoun Six?

					WEYOUN 
			It's only a matter of time.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
			So you keep saying.

					WEYOUN 
			I assure you, Founder. He will 
			be dealt with.

	The Female Shape-shifter stares at Weyoun for a beat, 
	then EXITS.

51   ANGLE ON

	Damar and Weyoun watching her go.

					WEYOUN 
			That was close. If she even 
			suspected Odo was our target...

	But Damar is focused on something else:

					DAMAR 
			Did you notice her face? How 
			parched it looked?

					WEYOUN 
			You heard her -- these rooms are 
			too hot.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE    41.

51   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR
				(thoughtful) 
			I wonder... I'm telling you she's 
			not well.

	Weyoun wants to change the subject.

					WEYOUN 
			She's not the Founder you should 
			be worried about.
				(with finality) 
			Now contact Olmerak and order 
			those ships to intercept the 
			runabout.

	Damar nods, though it's clear he's still mulling 
	over his observation about the Female Shape-shifter.

52   INT. RUNABOUT

	Odo continues to pilot the ship while WV-Six 
	finishes off his meal, placing the empty plate on 
	the seat behind him.

					WV-SIX
				(re: the meal) 
			That was filling.

					ODO 
			I would hope so. You sampled the
			Replicator's entire menu.

					WV-SIX 
			I enjoyed the different... textures.

					ODO
			You mean tastes, don't you?

					WV-SIX 
			Not at all. The Vorta sense of 
			taste is quite limited. About 
			the only foods we really enjoy 
			are kava nuts and rippleberries.

					ODO
			I take it this is also a result 
			of your genetic programming?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE    42.

52   CONTINUED:

					WV-SIX 
			It's the Founders' way of making 
			sure we remember our past.
				(off Odo's look) 
			You must know the story of how 
			the Founders created the Vorta...

					ODO
			No, but I have a feeling you're 
			going to tell me all about it.

					WV-SIX 
			The Vorta used to be very 
			different from what we are today. 
			We were forest dwellers. Small, 
			timid, ape-like creatures living 
			in hollowed-out trees.

					ODO
				(guessing) 
			Eating nuts and berries.

					WV-SIX
				(nodding) 
			And living in fear of the many 
			predators that hunted us for 
			food. One day, a wounded 
			changeling came stumbling through 
			the forest fleeing a mob of angry 
			"solids."

					ODO
			Why were they chasing him?

					WV-SIX 
			Does it matter? Solids have 
			always feared and distrusted 
			Shape-shifters, you know that.

	Odo can't deny that.

					WV-SIX 
			A family of Vorta hid the 
			changeling from his pursuers. 
			And in return for saving his 
			life, the changeling promised the 
			Vorta that one day, they would be 
			transformed into powerful beings. 
			That we would become an important 
			part of a great new empire that 
			would stretch across the Galaxy.

					ODO
				(intrigued) 
			And the changeling kept his word.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT THREE    43.

52   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WV-SIX 
			That's right. Imagine, Odo, my 
			people were once little more than 
			apes, and look at us now -- look 
			at what you've done for us.


					ODO
			If the story were true, it would 
			at least prove that my people are 
			capable of kindness and 
			generosity.

					WV-SIX 
			You care about your people very 
			much, don't you, Odo? In spite 
			of all that's happened between 
			you.

					ODO
				(quiet) 
			Maybe I do, but that doesn't 
			change the fact that they're 
			responsible for a war that's 
			killed millions.

					WV-SIX 
			Odo... there's something you need 
			to know.

	Weyoun feels the terrible weight of the news he's 
	about to reveal to Odo.

					WEYOUN 
			A sickness has spread throughout 
			the Great Link. 
				(a beat) 
			The Founders... are dying.

53   CLOSE ON ODO

	as he contemplates this shocking revelation. And on 
	that moment, we:

54   INT. RUNABOUT - CONTINUOUS

	As before. Minutes later.

					WV-SIX 
			I was summoned to a meeting by 
			the female changeling -- she 
			wanted to discuss troop 
			deployments with me. Suddenly, 
			her hands began to... shrivel. 
				(a beat) 
			It only lasted a second or two... 
			but over the last few weeks, it's 
			happened a number of times. It's 
			like she's... withering.

					ODO
			And you're sure the other 
			changelings have also been 
			infected?

					WV-SIX 
			She said the entire Link is 
			suffering from the disease.

					ODO
			Everyone but me.

					WV-SIX 
			If they're unable to find a cure, 
			you'll be the last of your kind.

					ODO
				(pained) 
			Why didn't you tell me this 
			earlier?

					WV-SIX 
			Because I knew how much it would 
			hurt you. I'm sorry to bring you 
			such sad news.

	Odo nods, he's not blaming the messenger.

					WV-SIX 
			But at least you're not infected. 
			The Dominion will survive.

					ODO
			Meaning what?

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR    44A.

54   CONTINUED:

					WV-SIX 
			Think about it... you have an 
			opportunity to rectify the 
			mistakes your people have made. 
			To build a new Dominion based on 
			cooperation, not conquest; on 
			peace, not war... a new order 
			under your leadership.

					ODO
			And what's your role going to be 
			in this "new order?"

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR     45.

54   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WV-SIX 
			Whatever you want it to be. I 
			wish only to serve you.

	But before Odo responds, the Proximity Alarm SOUNDS 
	OFF again.

					ODO 
			All right, then maybe you can 
			start by telling me how one 
			runabout is going to survive an 
			assault by four Jem'Hadar ships.

55   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	to see the FOUR JEM'HADAR SHIPS approaching.

56   INT. RUNABOUT

	Resume.

					WV-SIX 
			I'm sure you'll think of 
			something.

	And indeed Odo is already checking the navigation 
	display.

					ODO 
			There's a Kuiper Belt, not far 
			from here. We might be able to 
			hide among the comet fragments.

	Odo adjusts some controls to change course. Then 
	checks the displays. The readout isn't comforting.

					ODO 
			But we don't have much time. 
			They're closing fast.

57   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Runabout moves along at warp. Not far behind 
	are the four Jem'Hadar Ships giving chase.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR     46.

58   ANOTHER ANGLE - THE KUIPER BELT (OPTICAL)

	To see the Runabout DROP OUT OF WARP as it enters a 
	field of asteroid-sized chunks of dirty ice -- the 
	stuff of comets. Too far from a star to have tails, 
	they're icebergs in space -- cracked, jagged and 
	irregular.

	The ship banks sharply and dives below one of the 
	floating chunks, vanishing from sight.

59   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	to see the Jem'Hadar ships drop out of warp and 
	begin searching for the Runabout.

60   INT. RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)


	WV-Six glances at Odo, who's carefully working the 
	controls as their ship weaves between the comet 
	fragments.

					WV-SIX 
			These comet fragments are nothing 
			but huge chunks of ice. The 
			Jem'Hadar will have no trouble 
			finding us.

					ODO
			Not if we become the ice...

					WV-SIX 
			What do you mean?

	But Odo only works his console, leaving WV-Six's 
	question unanswered.

61   EXT. SPACE - THE KUIPER BELT (OPTICAL)

	The Runabout passes a chunk of ice, then banks and 
	dives toward a deep fissure in its surface.

62   ANOTHER ANGLE - THE KUIPER BELT (OPTICAL)

	FROM BEHIND THE RUNABOUT as it plunges into the 
	crevasse. The phasers fire a brief salvo, which 
	MELTS and WIDENS the cavern ahead.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR     47.

63   INT. RUNABOUT

	Odo's nimble fingers whip to another control. The 
	LIGHTS GO OFF, leaving only the ambient light 
	filtering in through the windows.

					ODO 
			With the power off and the 
			runabout in thermal contact with 
			the ice, we won't generate enough 
			of an energy signature for their 
			sensors to read.

					WV-SIX 
			We "become" the ice.
				(inspired) 
			Only a god would think of such a 
			thing.

					ODO
				(ignoring the 
				compliment) 
			Let's hope the Jem'Hadar give up 
			their search before we freeze to 
			death.

					WV-SIX 
			My faith will keep me warm.

					ODO
			Perhaps. But an hour from now, 
			you may want to trade in that 
			faith for a thermal blanket.

64   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	CLOSE on O'Brien and Bashir, back in his Starfleet 
	uniform, studiously pondering a large, WHITE desk 
	sitting where the captain's old desk used to be.

					O'BRIEN 
			What do you think?

					BASHIR
			It's white.

					O'BRIEN
			I know it's white -- I'm going to 
			paint it.

					BASHIR
			It's the wrong shape... the wrong 
			height... the wrong width... 
			other than that, it's perfect.
				(dry)

64   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR 
				(Cont'd)
			The Captain will never suspect
			you switched desks on him.

					O'BRIEN 
			I need help, Julian -- not 
			sarcasm.

					BASHIR
			I'm afraid the only person who 
			can help you is Nog.

					O'BRIEN

			I just hope he gets back to the 
			station before the captain does.

					BASHIR 
				(teasing) 
			Maybe he isn't coming back. 
			Maybe he decided to make a run 
			for it.

	A moment as O'Brien considers this terrible possibility...

64A  NEW ANGLE

	as Kira ENTERS.

					KIRA 
			That's not the captain's desk.

					BASHIR
			He's going to paint it.

					KIRA
			Get it out of here.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR     48.

64B  ANGLE ON THE DOOR

	as it opens to allow an angry General Martok to 
	ENTER.

					KIRA
			Can I help you, General?

					MARTOK
			No...

	The General points an accusatory finger at O'Brien.

					MARTOK
			But he can.

	Bashir and Kira look over at O'Brien wondering what 
	trouble he's gotten himself into now.

64C  CLOSE ON O'BRIEN

	wondering the same thing.

64D  INT. CARGO BAY

	CLOSE ON the empty Klingon cargo containers we saw earlier.

					O'BRIEN (O.S.)
			Bloodwine?

64E  WIDER

	to see O'Brien flanked by Worf and General Martok.

					MARTOK
			Sixteen cases, sent to me by my
			wife. Now, where are they?

					O'BRIEN
			How should I know?

					WORF
			You authorized their removal.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR     49.

64E  CONTINUED:

	Worf hands O'Brien a PADD.

					WORF
			That is your authorization code, 
			isn't it?

					O'BRIEN
			Nog...

					MARTOK 
			Chief, I want that bloodwine back 
			here by tomorrow. Understood?

	HOLD ON O'Brien -- just when he thought life

68   INT. RUNABOUT

	The LIGHTS are STILL OFF. We can barely make out
	Odo and WV-Six's features as they sit in the 
	darkness, but it's clear that WV-Six has draped 
	himself in a thermal blanket and is struggling to 
	breathe. We hear the labored breathing of WV-Six.

					WV-SIX 
			Odo, when you said you were 
			cutting power to all systems... 
			did that include life support?

					ODO
				(preoccupied) 
			I'm afraid so.

	When Odo speaks, he sounds preoccupied; burdened by 
	a great weight.

					WV-SIX 
			That explains it.

					ODO
			Explains what?


					WV-SIX 
			Why I'm having trouble breathing.

					ODO
			We should have enough air left 
			for another three hours.

  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FOUR 51-52.    

68   CONTINUED:

					ODO (Cont'd)

			Of course, by then we'll have

					WV-SIX 
				(adamant) 
			But you can't die. You have to

	Suddenly, the SHIP SHAKES from a nearby explosion.

					WV-SIX
				(alarmed)
			They found us --

69   EXT. SPACE - THE KUIPER BELT (OPTICAL)

	FOUR JEM'HADAR SHIPS scan the cluttered ice field. 
	Suddenly, a DISRUPTOR BOLT leaps from one and BLOWS 
	A COMET TO BITS. A second Jem'Hadar does the same 
	to another comet, then a third in rapid succession. 
	On this ominous portent, we...

									FADE OUT.

	The ship ROCKS again, this time a little harder.

					WV-SIX
			What do we do now?

					ODO
			We can't stay here...

	Odo starts working his console. The lights come on 
	as the ship comes to life.

					WV-SIX
			You're not going to try to outrun

					ODO
			What choice do we have?

72   EXT. SPACE - THE KUIPER BELT (OPTICAL)

	The Runabout blazes out of the interstellar iceberg 
	and hurtles TOWARD CAMERA.

73   THE JEM'HADAR FIGHTERS (OPTICAL)

	They're spread throughout the field. The closest 
	one peels off toward us, followed by the others.

74   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	to see the Runabout skirt the edge of the ice belt, 
	trying to keep the comets between it and the 
	Jem'Hadar fighters. As the closest one rolls in 
	toward the Federation ship's flank, the Runabout's 
	PHASERS TEAR INTO ITS BACK. The Jem'Hadar ship 
	SHUDDERS, SLOWS DRASTICALLY and starts TRAILING 
	PLASMA. But it still manages to unleash a 
	devastating DISRUPTOR BURST at the Runabout.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     54.

75   INT. RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)

	The SHIP SHAKES from a TREMENDOUS HIT. SPARKS FLY 
	from one of the consoles as SMOKE billows from 
	another.

					WV-SIX
			We're on fire.

					ODO
			There's an extinguisher right
			behind you.

	ANOTHER HIT SHAKES the ship. WV-Six hesitates. He 
	can see the future, and neither of them are going to 
	be in it unless he does something about it. He 
	looks over at Odo with admiration and devotion. But 
	Odo is focused on his panels.

					ODO
			What are you waiting for?

					WV-SIX
				(with a wry smile)
			I live only to serve you.


76   ANGLE ON WV-SIX

	as he reaches for the fire extinguisher, crosses to 
	the SMOKING console and puts out the fire. The ship 
	takes ANOTHER HIT.

	Keeping an eye on Odo, WV-Six moves over to a 
	console in the back and begins to work the panel.

77   ANGLE ON ODO

	as he continues to pilot the ship, something on his 
	console catches his attention.

					ODO
				(to WV-Six)
			What are you doing?

	Odo turns to look at the Vorta.

					ODO
			Why'd you activate the com

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     55.

78   ON WV-SIX (OPTICAL)

	as if in answer to Odo's question, the monitors 
	come to life revealing --

79   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM

	Weyoun and Damar, interested to learn why WV-Six has 
	contacted them.

					WV-SIX 
			All right, you can call off those 
			ships now.

					WEYOUN 
			Why should I?

					WV-SIX 
			Because you don't need them 
			anymore.

								INTERCUT AS NEEDED:

	WV-Six places his index finger behind his ear and 
	his thumb under his chin, then applies pressure. 
	Immediately, Weyoun smiles and even Damar looks on 
	with relief as WV-Six staggers back, grabbing onto 
	the console for support.

					WEYOUN 
				(smiling) 
			I'm glad to see you've come to 
			your senses.

	Odo taps a few keys, putting the ship on autopilot, 
	then races over to WV-Six, whose legs buckle and give 
	out from under him. Odo kneels by his side to attend to
	him.

					ODO
			What've you done?

					WV-SIX
			I've saved your life... and the
			Dominion's as well.

					WEYOUN

	Weyoun nods to Damar, but Damar hesitates as another 
	HIT rocks the runabout.

					DAMAR
			We don't know what he told Odo. 
			He may have revealed important 
			tactical --

					WEYOUN
				(cutting him off) 
			That's a risk we'll just have to 
			take.

	Weyoun leans over and works a console.

					WEYOUN
				(to Odo) 
			I've ordered the Jem'Hadar to 
			break off their attack. I see 
			your runabout has suffered some 
			battle damage. Will you require 
			any further assistance?

					ODO
				(pointed) 
			I think you've done enough.

					WEYOUN 
			I sincerely regret any 
			inconvenience we may have caused 
			you, Odo. Please have a safe and 
			pleasant journey back to Deep 
			Space Nine.

	Weyoun ENDS THE TRANSMISSION.

									END INTERCUT.

80   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Odo remains by WV-Six's side, their ship no 
	longer under attack.

					WV-SIX 
			They say voluntary termination is 
			quick and painless... I'm afraid 
			it's not true...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     57.

80   CONTINUED:

	Odo can't help but feel pity as he watches the 
	clone's agony.

					ODO 
			I'll get you a pain-suppressor.

	WV-Six clutches Odo's forearm with whatever strength 
	he has left.

					WV-SIX 
			That won't be necessary... but 
			there is one thing you can do for 
			me.

					ODO
			What's that?

					WV-SIX 
			Give me your blessing.

					ODO 
			I can't...

	Shuddering in pain, he struggles to stay conscious.

					WV-SIX 
			Please, Odo... tell me that I 
			haven't failed... that I've 
			served you well.

	Odo can't help but be moved by WV-Six's simple, 
	sincere devotion.

					ODO 
			You have. And for that, you have 
			my gratitude...

81   CLOSER ON ODO

	as he decides to give the dying Vorta his wish.


 DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE 58-58A.    

81   CONTINUED:

					ODO
				(gently)
			... and my blessing.

80   ON WV-SIX

	as he smiles, lets out one last breath, and dies.
	Off Odo's conflicted expression...

83   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establish the station.

84A  INT. OPS

	O'Brien walks through Ops towards the captain's 
	office like a condemned man on his way to his own 
	hanging. He passes by Doctor Bashir, who is handing 
	a PADD to a supernumerary.

					BASHIR
				(a warning)
			Miles, the captain's back.

					O'BRIEN
				(stops)
			I know. He just called for me.

					BASHIR
			Good luck.

					O'BRIEN 
			Thanks, Julian.

	O'Brien looks up at the office, swallows, then 
	continues up the steps, ready to meet his fate.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     59.

84B  INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	O'Brien ENTERS to find Captain Sisko... seated 
	behind his very own, very familiar desk. Nog is 
	standing nearby, grinning triumphantly.

					SISKO 
			Chief.

					O'BRIEN
				(surprised) 
			Captain -- your desk...

					SISKO 
				(pleased) 
			It looks nice, doesn't it? I 
			came in this morning to find 
			Ensign Nog polishing it.

	Nog proudly holds up a well-worn rag.

					NOG 
			It was looking a little dull.

	Sisko takes a PADD from his desk and hands it to 
	O'Brien.

					SISKO 
			Here's the maintenance request 
			from the Gettysberg. It should 
			be docking later today.

	O'Brien is surprised that his "execution" appears to 
	have been called off.

					SISKO 
			That'll be all, Chief.

					O'BRIEN
			Yes, sir.

	As O'Brien starts to leave --

					SISKO
			Oh, about the stabilizer...

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     60.

84B  CONTINUED:

	O'Brien steadies himself -- he knew he wasn't going 
	to get off that easily.

					O'BRIEN 
			Sir, I can explain...

					SISKO 
			Don't bother... Nog told me you 
			were able to get hold of one this 
			morning.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Nog)
			I was?

	Nog nods.

					O'BRIEN 
				(to Sisko) 
			I mean -- I was.

					SISKO
			How long before you can have it 
			on-line?

					O'BRIEN
				(to Sisko) 
			About eight hours.

					SISKO
			I intend to take the Defiant out 
			on patrol in two.

					O'BRIEN
			Two it is, sir.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     61.

84C  INT. OPS

	A relieved O'Brien and Nog emerge from the captain's 
	office and jaunt down the steps.

					O'BRIEN
			I don't know how you did it,
			Nog...

					NOG 
			I never lost faith in the Great 
			Material Continuum.

					O'BRIEN
			It's like you said -- the river 
			will provide.

	But their good cheer is short-lived as General 
	Martok and Worf ENTER from the Turbolift.

					MARTOK 
			Chief!

					O'BRIEN
				(sotto voce) 
			The waters just got choppy 
			again...

	Martok hands O'Brien a bottle of bloodwine.

					MARTOK 
			I wanted you to have this. 
			Consider it an apology.

					O'BRIEN
				(brightening) 
			You found the bloodwine.

					WORF
			Not exactly. Ensign Nog returned 
			from his trip with sixteen cases 
			of twenty-three-oh-nine. A very 
			good year.

					MARTOK 
			An even better vintage than the 
			one my wife sent me.

					O'BRIEN 
			I'm glad you approve.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     62.

84C  CONTINUED:

					NOG 
			And remember, anytime you're 
			shopping for wines or spirits -- 
			my cousin Gant is the man to see.

					WORF
			We'll keep that in mind.

	And with that General Martok EXITS, while Worf goes 
	to his station.

84D  ANGLE ON O'BRIEN

	as he turns to Nog.

					O'BRIEN 
			Your cousin Gant?

					NOG
			Just another sailor on the Great
			River...

	They head toward the turbolift.

					NOG 
			By the way, Gant mentioned that 
			he's got ten cases of Saurian 
			Brandy. It's the captain's 
			favorite, you know.

	They board the turbolift.

					O'BRIEN
				(to computer) 
			Level Five.

	The lift starts to descend.

					O'BRIEN
				(intrigued)
			What's he want for them... ?

	Off this...

88   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	Odo is standing by the window, gazing thoughtfully 
	at the stars. Kira is standing by her replicator, 
	sipping a cup of raktajino.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE    62A.

88   CONTINUED:

					ODO
				(uncomfortable) 
			I don't think I'll ever forget 
			the look on his face when he 
			died. He seemed so... content.

					KIRA
			The last thing he saw was one of 
			his gods smiling at him. If you 
			ask me, he was a lucky man.

	Odo shoots Kira a glance, thinking she's teasing 
	him.

					ODO 
			Nerys, please.

					KIRA
			No, listen to me.
				(a beat) 
			I know, to Starfleet the Prophets 
			are nothing more than wormhole 
			aliens. To me, they're gods. I 
			can't prove it, but then again, I 
			don't need to. My faith in them 
			is enough. Just like Weyoun's 
			faith in you was enough for him.

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Treachery... " - REV. 09/18/98 - ACT FIVE     63.

88   CONTINUED:	(2)

	There's a long beat as Odo thinks about all this. 
	But there's something else weighing on his mind as 
	well.

					ODO 
			Now it appears the Vorta may have 
			to learn to get along without 
			their gods.

	Kira puts her arm on his back sympathetically.

					KIRA 
			I'm sorry. You're worried about 
			your people.

					ODO
			The changelings are dying and I 
			can't help them. They're the 
			enemy.

					KIRA
			A very dangerous enemy -- now 
			more than ever, because they're 
			desperate.
				(a beat) 
			I know this isn't easy for you, 
			but you have to remember that 
			they started this war -- not you.

					ODO
			That's true... but I know now 
			that which ever side wins, one 
			thing is certain.
				(a beat) 
			I'm going to lose.

	She takes his hand as he continues to stare silently 
	out the window. His fingers tighten over hers and 
	we...

									FADE OUT.
