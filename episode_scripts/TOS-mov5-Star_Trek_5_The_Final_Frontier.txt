                         A WORD ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF THIS SCRIPT

            Many people tend to use terms like "universe" and "cosmos" and galaxy 
            rather loosely. This script will remain true to the STAR TREK trad-
            ition of scientific reality. With a few possible exceptions, the STAR 
            TREK series and films take place within our own galaxy. The galaxy is 
            vast, but finite (as opposed to the universe which is infinite). As 
            Gene Roddenberry has pointed out, ony 115 of this galaxy will have 
            been explored by the 23rd Century.

            Because the galaxy is finite, however, it has a center. It is unlikely 
            that by the time of this tale, this central are, distant and dangerous, 
            will have been explored. Nor can anyone say for sure what we may find 
            there.

            These basic assumptions evolve from our on-going discussions with the 
            staff of I.P.A.C. (Infrared Processing and Analysis Center) of JPL/Cal 
            Tech. Their incredible computer graphics, obtained by advanced infra-             
            red satellite telescope photography, will be made available to use to 
            enhance not only the accuracy, but the incredible beauty of this 
            latest STAR TREK voyage.

                   Shimmering waves of heat. A flat unforgiving landscape 
                   stretches to infinity. A storm of dust gathers on the 
                   horizon, small at first, increasing in size as it 
                   rolls toward us. Hoofbeats fill the soundtrack. Just 
                   as the storm threatens to engulf us, A RIDER ON 
                   HORSEBACK emerges.

                   A twisted rhino horn juts from the snout of this odd 
                   creature. The Rider spurs the beast, driving it onward. 
                   His white robes flare out behind him like the wings 
                   of an avenging angel. He rides like a man possessed.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   Camera pans an arid expanse of scorched earth. J'ONN, 
                   a ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien 
                   race, toils beneath a blazing sun, his back to camera. 
                   He sinks an augering device into the ground, drilling 
                   in vain for water. There are many hundreds
                   of holes in the earth around him.

                   J'onn reacts to the clop of approaching hooves. He 
                   tenses, then whirls around clutching a crude home-made 
                   pipe gun.

                   Horse and rider thunder toward him.

                   J'onn raises his pipe gun and fires a warning shot. 
                   The Rider reins his horse to a halt ten feet short 
                   of J'onn. The beast snorts and stamps its hooves 
                   impatiently while the Rider studies the frightened 
                   homesteader and removes a breathing device from his 
                   mouth. Finally, he speaks.

                                           RIDER
                             I thought weapons were forbiddeen on 
                             this planet.

                   The Rider swings down from the saddle. He's tall, power-
                   fully built beneath his dusty robs, his face shadowed by 
                   a hood. He indicates their bleak surroundings.

                                           RIDER
                                     (continuing)
                             Besides, I can't believe you'd kill 
                             me for a field of empty holes.

                                           J'ONN
                                     (pathetic)
                             It's all I have.

                   J'onn sags under the futile weight of his existence. 
                   The Rider approaches him without fear. He gently 
                   removes the weapon from J'onn's trembling hands. It's 
                   all the homesteader can do to keep from sobbing.

                                           RIDER
                             Your pain runs deep.

                                           J'ONN
                                     (turns away in 
                                      embarrassment)
                             What do you know of my pain?

                                           RIDER
                             Let us explore it together.

                   The Rider collects himself and concentrates deeply. 
                   J'onn is immediately transfixed. He begins to tremble. 
                   Tears flood his dirty cheeks.

                                           RIDER
                                     (continuing; soothing
                                      tone)
                             Each man hides a secret pain. It must 
                             be exposed and reckoned with. It must 
                             be hauled from the darkness and 
                             forced into the light. Share your 
                             pain with me and gain strength from 
                             it.

                  J'onn whimpers and cries out in anguish. Finally, the 
                  catharis ends. J'onn drops to his knees, then looks up. 
                  He opens his eyes and blinks in wonder and amazement 
                  at the Rider. The Rider helps him to his feet.

                                           J'ONN
                                     (as if reborn)
                             Where did you get this power?

                                           RIDER
                             The power was within you.

                                           J'ONN
                                     (trying to find
                                      the words)
                             I feel as if a weight has been lifted 
                             from my heart. How can I repay you 
                             for this miracle?

                                           RIDER
                             Join my quest.

                                           J'ONN
                             What is it you seek?

                                           RIDER
                             What you seek. What all men have 
                             sought since time began -- the 
                             ultimate knowledge. To find it, we'll 
                             need a starship.

                                           J'ONN
                             A starship? There are no starships on 
                             Nimbus III.

                                           RIDER
                             Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.

                                           J'ONN
                             But how?

                                           RIDER
                             Have faith my friend. There are more 
                             of us than you know.

                   as he throws back his hood to reveal rugged charismatic 
                   features. He's bearded, his hair is shaggy. He has the 
                   piercing eyes of a zealot and, to our surprise, pointed 
                   ears. His name is SYBOK.

                                           J'ONN
                                     (o.s., amazed)
                             You're a Vulcan.

                   Sybok nods and does something we've never seen a Vulcan 
                   do. He smiles. And as he does, the first faint bars of 
                   the Star Trek Theme well up on the soundtrack.

                   The Vulcan, his convert and the horse are tiny figures 
                   in a overpoweringly bleak landscape. Camera tilts up

                   eight hundred feet above the surrounding forest. He 
                   climbs the face of El Capitan without ropes, gromets 
                   or equipment. Just man against mountain. Using the
                   cracks in the rock face for hand and foot holds, Jim 
                   Kirk struggles up the treacherous incline, one 
                   painful inch at a time. We hold our breath, afraid

                   He inserts the pads of two fingers into a narrow crack 
                   above his head. He exhales, focusing concentration. 
                   Kirk pulls himself up, balancing on a ledge barely an 
                   inch wide. Exhilarated, he pauses to admire the view.

                   Spock hovers in mid-air along side the startled Kirk,

                                           KIRK
                             I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points 
                             of interest in Yosemite and you pick 
                             me.

                   Spock doesn't take Kirk's hint to get lost.

                                           SPOCK
                             I regret to inform you that the record 
                             time for free-climbing El Capitan is 
                             in no danger of being broken.

                                     (as he climbs)
                             I'm not trying to break any records, 
                             Spock. I'm doing this because I 
                             enjoy it. Not to mention the lost 
                             important reason for climbing a 
                             mountain...

                                           SPOCK
                             Which is?

                                     (with a smile)
                             Because its there.

                                           SPOCK
                             Captain, I do not think you realize 
                             the gravity of your situation.

                   Kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save 
                   himself. Beneath his feet a mini-avalanche of rocks 
                   is dislodged, tumbling to the valley below.

                             On the contrary. Gravity is foremost 
                             on my mind, Spock. Look, I'm trying 
                             to make an ascent here. Why don't 
                             you go pester Dr. McCoy for a while?

                                           SPOCK
                             Dr. McCoy is not in the best of moods.

                   McCoy, still watching Kirk's progress, is getting an-
                   grier by the second.

                   Kirk strains for the next handhold.

                             Concentration is vital. You must be 
                             one with the mountain.

                             Spock, I appreciate your concern but 
                             if you don't stop distracting me, 
                             I'm liable to be one with the...

                   McCoy lets out a gasp as he watches Kirk's tiny figure 
                   drop down the face of El Cap.

                   He dives after Kirk firing boosters to increase his 
                   speed.

                   Twisting and turning end over end as he hurtles down-
                   ward. He thrashes at air, unable to defeat gravity.

                   McCoy turns away, unable to watch.

                   Dropping... dropping... the ground rushing up like a 
                   hungry mouth. A split-second before impact...

                   The Vulcan swoops into shot. His powerful fingers grab 
                   Kirk by the ankle and jerk him upward in the nick of 
                   time.

                   McCoy hasn't heard the expected splat. He turns to 
                   look and what he sees is:

              23   WIDE SHOT                                                   23

                   Kirk is supended in air, bobbing upside down at the 
                   end of Spock's arm.

                   The top of Kirk's head is practically touching the 
                   ground. That's how close he came to being pizza. Kirk 
                   blinks in disbelief.

                                           SPOCK
                             Perhaps "because it is there" is not 
                             a sufficient reason for wanting to 
                             climb a mountain.

                   Kirk dangles -- undignified but lucky to be alive.

                                           KIRK
                             I'm hardly in a position to disagree.

                   McCoy is heard in approach.

                   McCoy is seen upside down.

                             Dammit Jim, are you that anxious to 
                             meet your maker?

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   Sybok and his mount ride majestically to the top of a 
                   dune and halt. They are followed by J'onn. He's on 
                   foot but he clambers over the dune with determination. 
                   Behind J'onn comes another tattered homesteader. And 
                   behind him, two more. Without warning, a virtual army 
                   of ragged settlers swarm over the dune. They fill the 
                   screen, aliens of every different race, the poor and
                   downtrodden -- united in their devotion to Sybok.

              27   ANGLE - SYBOK                                               27

                   His army draws up beside him, dust rising. Sybok points 
                   into the blurry middle distance.

                                           SYBOK
                             My friends, behold Paradise.

                   Camera pans off Sybok. Below them sprawls the single 
                   outpost of civilization on this desolate world -- a 
                   small ramshackle village smack in the middle of no-
                   where, surrounded by high walls. A lone rider on 
                   horseback crosses the desert, headed for the outpost.

              28   CLOSER SHOT - MAIN GATE                                     28

                   Across the top of the arch, broken letters spell out 
                   "Paradise." Some cynical jiker has added the word 
                   "Lost." The lone rider signals the lookout sentries 
                   who open the heavy iron gate. Camera cranes up over 
                   the arch as the rider passes beneath and rides toward 
                   the sleazy-looking saloon at the far end of the street.

                                                                          CUT TO:

              29   INT. PARADISE CITY SALOON - DAY                             29

                   A 23rd Century equivalent of a frontier saloon. Fut-
                   uristic honky tonk music. The patrons are rugged, 
                   unpleasant types. Klingons, Romulans, Andorians, you 
                   name it. Much drink and boistrous talk. Arguments. 
                   Fistfights. Two men play futuristic "pool" on a table
                   filled with water.

              30   A SEXY CATWOMAN dances atop the bar, flicking her 
                   long striped tail and hissing seductively at her 
                   rowdy audience.

                   A STRANGER coming from outside approaching familiar 
                   western-style doors. But instead of swinging open 
                   like you'd expect, they whoosh apart automatically. 
                   The stranger steps into the bar and the doors whoosh 
                   back into place.

              32   WIDE SHOT                                                   32

                   Talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its 
                   attention to the newcomer. The stranger, seen only 
                   from the back, steps into the squalid bar. The Bar-
                   tender jerks his thumb in the direction of the back 
                   room. The stranger crosses to the back room door and 
                   dissapears inside. Talk and noise resume.

              33   INT. BACK ROOM                                              33

                   The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face 
                   and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her 
                   name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold 
                   of the room, trying to adjust her eyes to the murky 
                   surroundings. She's a little nervous and a long way 
                   from home.

                   The back room is an area for unwanted odds and ends. A
                   ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air around. 
                   TWO MEN are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends of a 
                   table. They're too busy drinking to notice Caithlin's 
                   entrance.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.

                   The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his 
                   head in her direction. He wearily extracts himself 
                   from his chair and comes forward. He's a Terran (spec-
                   ifically, an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT. Thin 
                   and dissipated, alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of the 
                   diplomatic corps. He pats down his unruly hair and
                   straightens his soiled suit. He gives Caithlin a tired 
                   smile and extends a limp hand.

                                           TALBOT
                             Ah, yes. Our new Romulan represent-
                             ative. Welcome to Paradise City, Miss 
                             Dar, capital of the so-called "Planet 
                             of Galactic Peace." I'm St. John 
                             Talbot, the Federation representative 
                             here on Nimbus III and my charming 
                             companion is the Klingon consul 
                             Korrd...

                   Caithlin regards the hulking figure on the other end 
                   of the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a 
                   once great warrior now past his prime. He doesn't 
                   rise to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from 
                   a flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             I expect that's Klingon for hello.

                   Reacting to Korrds stench, Caithlin holds her breathing 
                   device in front of her mouth.

                                           TALBOT
                             He doesn't speak English.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             And I don't speak Klingon.

                                           TALBOT
                             I'm relieved to hear that. Please sit 
                             down Miss Dar. Can I offer you a 
                             drink?

                   Caithlin brushes the dust from a chair at the opposite 
                   end of the table from Korrd.

                                           CAITHLIN
                                     (boldly)
                             I must say I'm shocked at what I've 
                             seen. Hunger. Poverty. No law enforce-
                             ment. And here the two of you sit 
                             drinking...

                   Without warning, Korrd drunkenly lets loose with a

                                           CAITHLIN
                             What did he say?

                                           TALBOT
                             He says he hopes you'll enjoy your 
                             tour of duty here. Might I ask, Miss 
                             Dar, what terrible thing you did to 
                             get yourself banished to this armpit 
                             of the galaxy?

                                           CAITHLIN
                             I volunteered.

                                           TALBOT

                             Volunteered.

                   Talbot turns to Korrd and translates her answer into 
                   Klingon. Korrd chortles derisively.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             Nimbus III is a great experiment. 
                             Twenty years ago when our three 
                             governments agreed to develop this 
                             planet together, a new age was born.

                                           TALBOT
                             Your new age died a quick death. The 
                             great drought put an end to it. And 
                             the settlers we conned into coming 
                             here -- the dregs of the galaxy. 
                             They immediately took to fighting 
                             amongst themselves. We forbade them 
                             weapons -- they fashioned their own.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             Then it appears I've arrived just in 
                             time. The policies that the three of 
                             us agree on will have far-reaching 
                             results...

                                           TALBOT
                             My dear girl, we're not here to agree. 
                             We're here to disagree. This "great 
                             experiment" as you call it was 
                             instigated to satisfy a bunch of 
                             bleeding hearts whining for "galactic 
                             peace." It was intended to fail.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             I'm afraid I don't share that view.

                                           TALBOT
                                     (pleased)
                             There, you see? We are disagreeing 
                             already.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             I'm here to open discussions for a 
                             solution to these problems.

                   Korrd comes to life. He roars with laughter and spits 
                   back a disgusting mouthful of Klingon. Talbot winces.

                                           CAITHLIN
                                     (losing patience)
                             What did he say? I want his exact 
                             words.

                                           TALBOT
                             He said the only thing he'd like to 
                             open is your blouse. He's heard 
                             Romulan women are different.

                   Caithlin's embarrassment turns to anger.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             You tell Consul Korrd -- never mind. 
                             I'll tell him myself in the only 
                             Klingon I know.

                   Caithlin let's loose with a Klingon epithet. No trans-
                   lation necessary. Sputtering with rage, Korrd hurls 
                   his flagon aside and clambers to his feet.

                                           KORRD
                                     (in perfect English)
                             Screw you too!

                                           CAITHLIN
                             He does speak English!

                                           TALBOT
                                     (surprised)
                             Sly old bugger!

                   Further argument is interrupted by shouts from outside 
                   and the whine of a warning klaxon.

                   A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate. 
                   It suddenly gives way. Camera climbs up over the top 
                   of the arch to reveal Sybok's army on the threshold 
                   of the city. In their midst, towering majestically 
                   above them, is Sybok on horseback. He urges his mount 
                   forward. With quiet determination, he and his army pour
                   under the arch and proceed up the main drag.

                   Townspeople scurrying for protection, anticipating an 
                   attack. Those who consider challenging Sybok are 
                   allayed by the crude weapons and intimidating looks 
                   of his followers. Sybok intends to take this town by 
                   show of force without having to fire a shot. And it
                   looks like he'll succeed.

              34   OMITTED                                                     34
                   
              35   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALOON                                  35

                   Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot emerge to see what the hub-
                   bub is about. When they see the approaching forces, 
                   Korrd and Talbot immediately turn tail and run back 
                   inside. After a moment, Caithlin follows.

              36   INT. SALOON                                                 36

                   Korrd, fearing the worst, goes behind the bar and 
                   opens a bottle. He upends it and pours the contents 
                   down his throat. He prefers to die drunk.

                   Talbot runs to the far side of the room and yanks a 
                   dusty sheet off a primitive communications screen. 
                   Caithlin rushes to his side as he desperately tries 
                   to get it working.

                   The saloon doors are forced open. J'onn and several 
                   soldiers pour in, brandishing weapons.

                                           J'ONN
                             Get away from that screen!

                   The klaxon winds down to eerie silence as the soldiers 
                   herd Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot together. Sybok enters.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (appraising them
                                      one by one)
                             Romulan. Terran. Klingon. Consider 
                             yourselves my prisoners.

                                     (scoffing)
                             Prisoners. We're already prisoners on 
                             this worthless ball of rock. Of what 
                             possible value could we be to you?

                                           SYBOK
                             Nimbus III may be a wonderous ball of 
                             rock, but it does have one unique 
                             treasure. It's the only place in the 
                             entire galaxy that has the three of 
                             you.

                   Korrd reaches for the pistol at his side. But before 
                   his fingers can grasp it, Sybok's soldiers noisily 
                   cock their weapons and point them at his heart. Korrd 
                   is outgunned and he knows it. He sputters impotently.

                                           CAITHLIN
                                     (to Sybok; boldly)
                             I don't know who you are or what you 
                             want but I can tell you this: our 
                             government will stop at nothing to 
                             insure our safety.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (with a smile)
                             That's exactly what I'm counting on.

                   On Caithlin's confused look...

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   Hanging in space like a big Christams ornament. The 
                   big blue marble called Earth is visible in the 
                   distance.

              38   INT. SPACEDOCK                                              38

                   A huge, cavernous area designed as a high and dry for 
                   space vessels. Among this warehouse of ships is the 
                   one we know best -- U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, NCC-1701-A.

                   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

                   A meager repair crew lazily overhauls consoles and 
                   monitors. Some things work, most do not. One thing 
                   that does work is CHIEF ENGINEER MONTGOMERY SCOTT 
                   who looks up as COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER UHURA enters, 
                   stepping around cables.

                                           SCOTTY

                             "Let's see what she's got" the Captain 
                             said. And then we found out, didn't 
                             we?

                                           UHURA
                             I'm sure you'll whip her into shape, 
                             Scotty. You always do.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (realizing)
                             Uhura, why aren't you on leave?

                                           UHURA
                             I thought we were going together.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (indicating the

                             I canna leave her when she needs me 
                             the most.

                                           UHURA
                             I had a feeling you'd say something 
                             like that. So...
                                     (produces a food
                                      pack)
                             I brought you some dinner.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (touched)

                             woman I know.

                   The Bridge light starts to flash red. An ear-splitting 
                   klaxon sounds.

                                           COMPUTER VOICE
                             Red alert. Red alert.

                                     (exasperated)
                             I just fixed that damn thing. Turn 
                             it off, will you?

                   Uhura goes to her console to switch it off but sees 
                   something odd. She punches a button and responds.

                   COMMANDER SULU and CHEKOV tramp through dense woods. 
                   From their weary expressions, its clear they've been 
                   hiking a long time. Sulu leads the way, Chekov 
                   trudges behind him.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Admit it. We're lost.

                             All right, we're lost.

                             But we're making good time.

                   Sulu's communicator beeps.

                                           SULU
                             I don't believe this.

                   Uhura studies a monitor showing Sulu and Chekov as two 
                   blips on a grid.

                             Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's 
                             been cancelled.

                   Sulu and Chekov look at each other.

                             Is there a problem, gentlemen?

                                           SULU
                             Er... yes. We've been caught in a 
                             blizzard!

                             And we can't see a thing. Request 
                             you direct us to the co-ordinates.

                   Chekov provides blizzard noises.

                   On Enterprise, Uhura listens to the "blizzard" and 
                   checks her graphics display for weather report. She 
                   smiles.

                                           UHURA
                             I'm sorry about your weather. My 
                             visual says sunny skies and seventy 
                             degrees.

                             Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's 
                             a miracle!

                                     (chuckling)
                             Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's 
                             safe with me. I'll send the shuttle-
                             craft to pick you up.

                                           SULU
                             Uhura, we owe you one. Sulu out.

                   Sulu and Chekov sit down on a boulder to wait.

                                           SULU
                                     (continuing)
                             I should have gone to Yosemite with 
                             the Captain.

                                           CHEKOV
                             What's the difference? If you've 
                             seen one national park, you've seen 
                             them all.

                   Camera tilts up to reveal Mt. Rushmore in the back-
                   ground. We pan the granite faces of Washington, 
                   Jefferson, Roosevelt, Lincoln and -- surprise -- the 
                   face of a fifth president (who happens to be a woman. 
                   A black woman.)

                   McCoy stands over a blazing campfire. A covered pot 
                   simmers on the coals. McCoy picks up a pan and bangs 
                   on it with a spoon. He's slightly tipsy.

                                           McCOY
                                     (calling out)
                             Come and get it.

                   Camera pulls back to reveal Kirk and Spock two feet 
                   away.

                                           KIRK
                             Knock it off, Bones. We're right here 
                             and we're starving.

                   McCoy grins and crouches beside the covered pot. He 
                   revels in their undivided attention.

                                           SPOCK
                             Bi-podal seeds, Doctor?

                                           McCOY
                             Beans, Spock -- but no ordinary beans. 
                             These are from an old Southern recipe 
                             handed down to me by my father. And 
                             if you turn your Vulcan nose at 
                             these, you're not just insulting me, 
                             you're insulting countless gener-
                             ations of McCoys.

                                           SPOCK
                             In that case, I have little choice 
                             but to sample your... beans.

                   McCoy ladles out the beans. Kirk tears into his. Spock 
                   tries a forkful. He finds the taste strangely exciting.

                                           SPOCK
                             Surprisingly good. However, it contains 
                             a flavoring I am not familiar with.

                                           McCOY
                             That's the secret ingredient.

                   Spock eats with enthusiasm.

                                           KIRK
                             Got any more of that secret ingredient, 
                             Bones?

                                           McCOY
                             You bet your buns.

                   McCoy grins and pulls out a bottle of bourbon. Spock 
                   stops in mid-chew and McCoy fills Kirk's cup.

                                           SPOCK
                             Am I to understand that your secret 
                             ingredient is... alcohol?

                             Bourbon, Spock. Kentucky bourbon.

                             Certainly doesn't show.

                   marshmallow which he attaches ot the end of a pointed 
                   stick.

                             I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

                   Marsh melon? Kirk and McCoy hide their smiles as Spock 
                   holds the marshmallow over the fire.

                             Well, I'll be damned. A marsh melon. 
                             Where did you learn that?

                             Before leaving the ship I consulted 
                             the library computer to familiarize 
                             myself with the customs of "camping 
                             out." The evening meal is tradition-
                             ally followed by the toasting of 
                             marsh melons.

                   Spock offers sticks and marshmallows to Kirk and McCoy 
                   who play along, amused by Spock's dead serious approach 
                   to frivolity.

                             Tell me something, Spock. What do we 
                             do after we toast the marsh... er, 
                             melons?

                             in. Doctor if you please...

                   McCoy starts to sing. Kirk joins in. Maybe it's the 
                   bourbon but the two of them sound pretty good.

                   They signal Spock that it's his turn to jump in but 
                   the Vulcan merely regards them quizzically. The

                   A NASA Pioneer probe tumbles through space. Ancient, 
                   forgotten, the device is flotsam. On it's side is a 
                   plaque showing image of two humans and simple mathe-
                   matical and scientific symbols. It comes past camera 
                   and out of this distortion, a Klingon Bird of Prey 
                   materializes.

                   Doors seperate to admit KLAA, the Bird of Prey's 
                   swashbuckling young captain. He is met by VIXIS, his 
                   first officer, a statuesque Klingon female. It's 
                   clear she adores Klaa.

                   Klaa's crew watches with excitement as their captain 
                   straps himself into his command chair which has been 
                   equipped with an elaborate gunner's rig allowing 
                   Klaa to do the shooting himself.

                   A periscope-like device swings into position in front 
                   of Klaa's flashing eyes.

                   The probe is a tiny traveling speck in the distance. 
                   Its course is erratic.

                   The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey 
                   swoops down for the attack. Machine gun-like phasers 
                   are mounted on the Bird's wings. They come to life 
                   and swivel, blasting a flange off the front of the 
                   probe. A second blast destroys a fin on the rear of 
                   the craft. A third shot blows away the antennae. 
                   Klaa is toying with the target.

              48   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE                                  48

                   The crew cheers each hit. They admire their captain 
                   and his deadly skill. But Klaa seems dissatisfied. 
                   He hesitates finishing the probe off.

                              a warrior's mettle. I need a target

                   Klaa unstraps himself from the command chair and joins 
                   Vixis at a monitor screen. The fearsome face of A 
                   KLINGON COMMANDER fills the screen and starts barking 
                   Klingon over shots of Nimbus III and the Paradise 
                   outpost. It's clear the Bird of Prey is being ordered 
                   to Nimbus III. Klaa and Vixis are charged with 
                   excitement.

                   Another blinding light, this one a ball of great int-
                   ensity sets down on the edge of the campsite, rousing 
                   Kirk, Spock and McCoy from sleep.

                   The three men rise and watch as a figure in silhouette 
                   emerges from the light and comes forward. It's Uhura.

                                           UHURA
                             Mister Scott appologizes for having 
                             to send the shuttlecraft but the 
                             transporter beam is not operational. 
                             Captain, we've recieved important 
                             orders from Starfleet.

                             You forgot to take it with you.

                   Uhura hands Kirk his communicator. It's clear he left 
                   it behind on purpose.

                   The bright light leaves the deserted campsite and rises 
                   against the mountain. It turns toward camera and 
                   reveals itself as a sleek shuttlecraft of impressive 
                   design. Aft thrusters fire and it shoots skyward.

                   This is the Galileo 5, capable of transporting two dozen
                   personnel. At the moment its passengers are Kirk, Spock, 
                   McCoy and Uhura who pilots the craft.

                   The ship is seen in her shining glory above Earth, 
                   framed against a full moon. The approaching Galileo is 
                   dwarfed by the magnificent starship.

                   A crewman watches a graphic of the approaching shuttle-
                   craft.

                   Bay doors open to receive Galileo. The tractor beam 
                   locks on to the shuttlecraft and slowly pulls her 
                   inside. It's a delicate maneuver. Even with wings re-
                   tracted, the Galileo clears the door with only a few 
                   feet on either side.

                   The shuttlecraft comes in for a smooth landing. Its 
                   side hatch opens to allow Kirk and company to exit. 
                   There's no one to greet them, just a few crewmen 
                   scurrying around. Scotty appears. He may be exhausted

                   McCoy and Uhura await.

                             have to be solved en route. Since 
                             we're undermanned, I'm counting on

                             this is a terrible idea. We're bound 
                             to bump into the Klingons and they

                   Spock is beside the wheel, staring at the stars, lost

              83   KIRK'S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS                             83

                   A tiny oasis in the near distance.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   A BAND OF RAGTAG SOLDIERS gather around a campfire. 
                   They are six in number, all men, members of Sybok's 
                   force. They are heavily robed to retard the night 
                   chill. They chat and drink. Nearby, their horses 
                   sip from a meager spring.

                   A woman's song floats out of the darkness -- soft 
                   and mysterious, seductive. The soldiers look at each 
                   other in surprise, then rise en masse to seek the 
                   scource of the singing. One of them points O.S. with 
                   excitement.

              85   THEIR POV                                                   85

                   In the distance, atop a dune and silhouetted against 
                   the low hanging twin moons... a female! But not just 
                   any female. This siren undulates as she sings, moving 
                   sensuously.

                   It's Uhura.

                   Drawn like moths to a flame. They stumble over each 
                   other to get a closer look, climbing on hands and 
                   knees up the steep dune were Lorelei Uhura waits at 
                   the top.

                   The slavering soldiers have almost reached the summit 
                   when they hear whinnies from their horses. The soldiers 
                   tear their eyes away from Uhura and look back to camp.

                   They turn back to Uhura who towers above them, a phaser 
                   in each hand.

                   Armed Enterprise crewmen enter shot to back her up.

                   Snarling horses pound over a rise, sending sand in all 
                   directions. Riders hurtle past camera with flowing 
                   capes and cowled faces. Ahead of them, Paradise City. 
                   Behind them, the desert -- a sea of darkness.

                   Kirk rides with determination, his face nearly hidden 
                   behind a burnoose. He looks over at the rider beside 
                   him. It's Spock, bouncing stiffly on the saddle, 
                   doing all he can to hang on.

                   Armed sentries watch from the walls as the scruffy 
                   band of horsemen cross the desert. J'onn, Sybok's 
                   convert appears, looking concerned.

                                           J'ONN

                   They gallop at full tilt, lead by Kirk. He shouts 
                   frantically to the sentries.

                   As Kirk and his party gallop through, the gate is 
                   closed behind them.

                   Kirk and the company rein their horses to a stop. Much 
                   movement and confusion. He shouts to J'onn and the 
                   soldiers on the walls.

                   J'onn and the soldiers turn their attention to the 
                   desert and prepare themselves for the confrontation.

                   As soldiers rush past them to defend the walls, Kirk 
                   and company coax their horses toward the saloon at 
                   the end of the street. They ride slowly, not wanting 
                   to attract any more attention than they have. 
                   Occasionally a crewmember drops away from the group 
                   and dismounts taking a position where he can lay 
                   down cover for the eventual escape.

                   Kirk's eyes sweep around. There are soldiers on most 
                   of the rooftops, heavily armed and dangerous looking.

                   Hiding it from view, Kirk raises a communicator to 
                   his lips.

                   While the others watch the desert, J'onn turns to watch 
                   the horsemen.

                   J'onn rushes to the big spotlight anchored on the wall. 
                   He wings its bright beam in the direction of the

                   Spock and his tri-corder and Kirk and his communicator 
                   are revealed as the light sweeps across him. Kirk and 
                   the others turn and react to the light, realizing that 
                   the jig is up.

                   pebbles fired from the enemy's crude weapons whiz 
                   around them like angry hornets. He gallops toward the 
                   blinding light, raises his phaser and with an expert 
                   shot, blows it to bits. The street goes dark, lit now

                   The soldiers on the walls and rooftops open fire with 
                   their crude weapons. The Enterprise crewmen fight back 
                   from strategic positions along the street, expertly 
                   picking off the enemy and using their transparent

                   He charges his horse in the direction of the saloon, 
                   clenching the reins with one hand and firing his 
                   phaser with the other. Enemy soldiers scatter in his

                   The Vulcan dismounts. As he heads for the saloon AN 
                   ENEMY SOLDIER leaps from a balcony, landing squarely 
                   in the saddle of Spock's horse. Armed with a sword 
                   the Soldier urges the steed forward to trample Spock. 
                   As Spock turns in response, the Soldier rears the 
                   horse up on its hind legs. Hooves threaten to pummel 
                   Spock into hamburger.

                   Spock calmly reaches up and presses his fingers into 
                   the horses's neck, executing a Vulcan nerve pinch. 
                   The horse collapses at Spock's feet. The rider 
                   stumbles off, gapping at disbelief at the Vulcan. 
                   Spock arches an eyebrow at him. The rider turns and

                   Sybok's soldiers set up a multiple pipe weapon cranked 
                   like a Gatling gun. Like the other weapons it uses 
                   pebbles for bullets. One of them catches an Enterprise 
                   crewman in the leg. He goes down.

                   The doctor rushes to the wounded crewman who clutches 
                   his leg. McCoy drags him to safety and digs into his
                   kit.

                   McCoy passes an instrument over the wound that emits a 
                   healing ray and effects the pebble. The crewman flexes
                   his leg. All better. McCoy gives the pebble to the 
                   crewman.

                             Stay off that leg for at least two 
                             minutes.

             109   INT. SALOON                                                109

                   Dark and empty. Phaser drawn, Kirk cautiously makes 
                   his way across the room when, with a sudden hiss, 
                   the Dancing Catwoman leaps over the bar and pounces 
                   on his back. As she claws at him, Kirk twirls her 
                   around in an "airplane spin" and throws her the 
                   length of the room. The Catwoman lands in the "pool" 
                   table, sending up waves of water that soak the walls.

             110   ANGLE                                                      110

                   Spock enters  and reacts  to the unconscious Catwoman 
                   as Kirk blasts open the door to the back room. 
                   Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot look up  in surprise. Kirk  
                   breathes a sigh of relief.

                                           KIRK
                             Thank God.

                   Spock appears at Kirk's side as Kirk signals for the 
                   Hostages to follow them.  But the hostages confound 
                   them by pointing three crude pistols at their heads.

             116   EXT. PARADISE - WIDE SHOT                                  116

                   The shuttlecraft has landed  and been captured. Sybok's
                   soldiers shout their victory from the gates and roof-
                   tops. Others swarm into the street.

             117   STREET                                                     117

                   Kirk and Spock are marched out of the saloon by the 
                   hostages. The rest of the Enterprise crew is herded 
                   together.

             118   ANGLE                                                      118

                   Sybok appears from behind the shuttlecraft to thund-
                   erous cheers. The soldiers shout his name.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (above their cheers)
                             Well done, my friends. Well done.

                   As the cheers begin to die, Spock detaches himself 
                   from Kirk and McCoy. In Vulcan he calls to Sybok 
                   whose back is turned.

                                           SPOCK
                             Qual es tu... Sybok?

                   Silence. Sybok cocks his head to one side. For the 
                   first time we see him vulnerable. He's afraid to 
                   turn and look. The voice... the question... It 
                   couldn't possibly be who he thinks it is. Or could 
                   it?

                                           SPOCK
                             Qual es tu?

                   Now Sybok knows he's not dreaming. He pivots and con-
                   fronts Spock across a distance of several yards. 
                   Soldiers move away, clearing a path between the two 
                   Vulcans.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (a choke of emotion)
                             Spock...

                   J'onn reacts with amazement.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (continuing; as he
                                      rushes forward)
                             Spock!

                   Sybok opens his arms to embrace his fellow Vulcan but 
                   Spock will have none of it. He raises his hand -- a 
                   stop sign. Sybok stops short, hurt and confused.

                   They regard each other. Spock is without emotion, all 
                   business. It dawns on Sybok that this is not out of 
                   character for Spock. Sybok smiles.

                                           SYBOK
                             Still tight-assed...

                   It's clear Sybok is trying to force an emotional reac-
                   tion from Spock. But Spock refuses to fall into his 
                   trap.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (continuing)
                             Spock, it's me. It's Sybok. You've 
                             finally caught up with me. Isn't 
                             there anything you want to say?

                                           SPOCK
                             Yes.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (a beat)
                             Well?

                                           SPOCK
                             You are under arrest for violating 
                             seventeen counts of Neutral Zone 
                             treaty.

                   Sybok is incredulous. There must be a hundred guns 
                   pointed at Spock's heart. Sybok can't help it. He 
                   chucles. The chuckle becomes a full rich laugh. The 
                   soldiers join in and soon their laughter is ringing 
                   through Paradise.

                                           SYBOK
                             Why, Spock, you've developed a 
                             sense of humor after all.

                                           SPOCK
                             It was not my intention to amuse 
                             you. These are serious charges. 
                             If you surrender now --

                                           SYBOK
                             I'm sorry, Spock, but I can't 
                             surrender now. I'm not through 
                             violating Neutral Zone treaty. In 
                             fact, I'm just getting started. 
                             And for my next violation, I 
                             intend to steal something... 
                             something very big.

                   J'onn and several soldiers chuckle knowingly. Spock 
                   seems bewildered.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (continuing)
                             I must have your starship.

                             You started this to get your hands 
                             on my ship?

                   Sybok regards Kirk in his grubby commando outfit.

                                           SYBOK

                             Spock, it would appear you've been 
                             given a second chance to join me.

                   Scotty punches in commands. On his graphics screen a 
                   series of dots wink on around an outline of the ship.

                   The Galileo's back hatch blows open, emitting a cloud

                   Kirk is no match for the Vulcan's superior strength 
                   but he fights with everything he's got. He manages to 
                   knock the weapon from Sybok's hand. It skitters 
                   across the floor and stops at the feet of Spock who 
                   has emerged from the shuttle.

                   Spock looks down at the weapon, then back to Kirk 
                   whom Sybok is rendering helpless with one hand. With 
                   his incredible strength, Sybok forces Kirk to the floor.

                   distastful object. Kirk collapses on the floor, 
                   conscious but no longer able to fight. Sybok faces 
                   Spock.

                                           SPOCK
                             Sybok, you must surrender.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (approaching Spock)
                             Spock, you can't stun me with that 
                             weapon and I've always been 
                             stronger than you. I'm afraid
                             you'll have to kill me.

                   Spock raises the weapon as Sybok advances.

                                           KIRK
                                     (desperate)
                             Spock -- shoot him!

                   But Spock can't shoot. The emotional price is too great. 
                   He lowers the weapon in shame and defeat. Sybok takes 
                   it from him with a smile.

                                           SYBOK
                             For a moment... I thought you might 
                             actually do it.

                   Sybok's soldiers emerge from the wreckage of the 
                   shuttle with McCoy. The doctor hurries to Kirk and 
                   helps him to his feet. Kirk, in pain and betrayed, 
                   glares at Spock who cannot meet his eyes.

                   Sybok turns to J'onn. He indicates Kirk and McCoy.

                                           SYBOK
                             Put these two in the Brig. Spock 
                             will accompany me to the Bridge.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (finding his voice)
                             I will not.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (a long pause)
                             Then you must join them.

                   J'onn and several other soldiers march Kirk, Spock and 
                   McCoy out.

                   Scotty witnesses the action on the deck below. Fortun-
                   ately, no one sees him. He steps back into the shadows.

                   Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot emerge from the shuttle 
                   with Sulu and Uhura in tow.

                             These two will be useful

                   Uhura and Sulu are defiant. Sybok approaches them.

                   Kirk, Spock and McCoy are shoved into a cell by J'onn. 
                   Phaser beam bars materialize to contain them. Kirk is 
                   enraged.

                             pull the trigger.

                             Sybok, too, is a son of Sarek.

                   Kirk and McCoy can't believe it.

                             Technically, you are correct. I 
                             do not have a brother.

                             Let me get this straight. You and 
                             Sybok have the same father but 
                             different mothers.

                                           SPOCK
                             That is correct. Sybok's mother 
                             was a Vulcan princess. After her 
                             death, Sybok and I were raised as 
                             brothers.

                             before?

                             I was not prepared to discuss... 
                             matters of a personal nature. For 
                             that I am sorry.

                                     (still fuming)
                             He's sorry. Well, I guess that makes 
                             everything all right, doesn't it?

                                           McCOY
                             Quit it, Jim. Spock couldn't kill 
                             his brother any more than he 
                             could kill you. If you want to 
                             punish him for what he's done, why 
                             don't you throw him in the Brig?

                   Kirk's anger burns itself out.

                   the command chair, stands to greet them.

                   Sybok enters, followed by the hostages and several 
                   armed soldiers. Chekov looks at Uhura and Sulu in 
                   confusion. They,  like the hostages, are smiling 
                   warmly -- converts to Sybok's cause.

                   Sulu moves past Chekov and takes his seat at the helm. 
                   He punches in commands.

                   Kirk balances on Spock's shoulders, examining the

                   throws it away and investigates a circuitry panel. 
                   Spock once again disaproves.

                   Kirk touches the panel and receives a shock that 
                   causes him to tumble to the floor.

                             emotions. They felt with their hearts
                             ... made love with their hearts...

                             hearts. Above all else, they believed 
                             in a place where these questions of 
                             existence would be answered. Modern 
                             dogma tells us this place is a 
                             myth... a fantasy concocted by pagans.

                             Some of us get off on long and 
                             dangerous climbs.

                             ship, we'll need it.

                             Head down this tunnel and make a 
                             right at the hydro vent, then a 
                             left at the blowscreen. You 
                             canna miss it.

                   Kirk, Spock and McCoy start down the tunnel.

                             Mister Scott, you're amazing.

                   Scotty walks off in the opposite direction.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (a little too prideful)
                             Nothing amazing about it. Why I know 
                             this ship like I know the back of my 
                             hand.

                   Scotty turns the corner and whacks his head on a low 
                   hanging pipe. He collapses to the floor, out cold.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   A warning klaxon sounds. Sybok's soldiers sweep 
                   through the ship.

                   Kirk, Spock and McCoy gaze up at a narrow and seem-
                   ingly endless elevator shaft. An emergency ladder 
                   attached to the wall is the only way up.

                             Or a heart attack.

                   Kirk starts to climb the emergency ladder. McCoy 
                   reluctantly follows. Spock watches. Then, unnoticed, 
                   he slips away.

                   Sulu, leading a team of converts, rounds a corner and 
                   nearly stumbles over Scotty. Scotty groans.

                   Kirk climbs hand over hand, followed by a huffing and 
                   puffing  McCoy.

                                           McCOY

                             Where's Spock?

                   Kirk and McCoy look down. No Spock. Just then, a soft 
                   whooshing sound from above. They look up.

             167   ANGLE                                                      167

                   Spock descends wearing the levitation boots from 
                   Yosemite. He floats alongside Kirk and McCoy, 
                   hovering in mid-air.

                             way.

                   Kirk breaks into a smile of relief. He steps off the 
                   ladder and grabs on to Spock. They dip down a few 
                   feet, then slowly rise to a hovering position beside 
                   McCoy.

                   Grumbling, a little fearful, McCoy steps on board. Their 
                   combined weight causes them to sink steadily downward.

                                           SPOCK
                             It would appear we are too heavy.

                   Sulu and the search party appear at the bottom of the 
                   shaft, armed with phasers.

                             If I activate them, we will be 
                             propelled upward at unpredictable 
                             speed.

                   Spock hits the boosters. With an explosion of power 
                   and noise they shoot skyward like a bullet.

                   Our heroes are an upward blur that shows no sign of 
                   stopping. Spock hits "the brakes" and they stop 
                   barely one floor from the ceiling, bobbing in mid-
                   air. Kirk and McCoy are white as sheets.

                   by a faint, scratchy female voice.

                              Wait outside.

                   J'onn and the soldiers reluctantly withdraw. Sybok 
                   indicates four chairs, arranged in a circle.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (continuing)
                              I'm sure you have many questions. 
                              Here, with the stars of the 
                              galaxy for our backdrop, we
                              shall seek the answers together.

                   The four men take their seats. The lighting becomes 
                   intimate. Sybok weaves his spell.

             176   INT. SICK BAY                                              176

                   Scotty awakens to find Uhura holding him in her arms.

                                           UHURA 
                                     (soothing)
                              Easy, Scotty. Your back with us.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (testing her)
                              Uhura. I had the strangest dream. I 
                              dreamt a madman had taken over the 
                              Enterprise.

                                           UHURA
                              Dear Scotty, he isn't a madman.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (realizing she's a
                                      convert)
                              He's not?

                                           UHURA
                              Sybok's put us in touch with feel-
                              ings we've always been afraid to 
                              express.

                   Uhura gives Scotty a loving look.

                                           SCOTTY
                                     (uncomfortable)
                              I... er... have to get back to the 
                              transporter.

                   Scotty slips out of her arms.

                                           UHURA
                              But there's so much I want to tell 
                              you.

                                           SCOTTY
                              Maybe when I'm a wee bit stronger. 
                              I dinna think I could take it in 
                              my present condition.
                                     (under his breath)
                              Or yours.

                   Scotty heads for the exit.

                                                                          CUT TO:

             177   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM - (1st R.P. DENSITY CHANGE)  177

                   Beyond the windows, the swirling vastness of space. 
                   Kirk, Spock and McCoy and Sybok sits in a circle.

                                           SYBOK
                              Sha Ka Ree. "The Source." Call it 
                              what you will. "Heaven." "Eden." 
                              The Klingons call it "Qui'Tu." To 
                              the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor."
                              The Andorian word is... unpronoun-
                              cable. Every culture shares this 
                              common dream of the place from 
                              which creation sprang. For us, 
                              that place will soon be a reality.

                                           KIRK
                              The only reality I see is that I'm 
                              a prisoner on my own ship. What is 
                              this power you have to control the 
                              minds of my crew?

                                           SYBOK
                              I don't control minds. I free them.

                                           McCOY
                              How?

                                           SYBOK
                              By making you face your pain and 
                              draw strength from it. Once that's 
                              done, fear cannot stop you.

                                           KIRK
                              Spock?

                                           SPOCK
                              It is an ancient Vulcan ritual -- 
                              forbidden in modern times.

                                           McCOY
                              Sounds like brainwashing to me.

                   Sybok closes his eyes and concentrates deeply.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (to McCoy; sensing)
                              Your pain is the deepest of all.

                                           McCOY
                                     (startled)
                              What?

                                           SYBOK
                              I can feel it. Can't you?

                                           MAN'S VOICE
                                     (o.s., a whisper of
                                      pain)
                              Leonard...

                                           McCOY
                              It's some kind of trick.

                                           MAN'S VOICE
                                     (o.s., imploring)
                              Leonard...

                                           McCOY
                                     (as he recognizes
                                      the voice)
                              Father?

                   The surrounding walls come alive with energy. What 
                   follows is theatrical in style as we enter a 
                   subjective world.

                                           McCOY
                                     (continuing; frightened)
                              My god. Don't do this.

             178   ANGLE - McCOY                                              178

                   He turns to find himself on a brilliantly white, sterile 
                   hospital room. A wasted figure reclines on a bed, an 
                   old man connected to a powerful  life support system. 
                   This is McCOY'S FATHER and we are somewhere in the past.

                                           FATHER
                                     (barely audible)
                              Leonard...

                   McCoy rushes to the bedside.

                                           McCOY
                              I'm here, Dad. I'm with you.

                                           FATHER
                              The pain... stop the pain...

                                           McCOY
                              I've done everything I can do, Dad. 
                              You've got to hang on.

                                           FATHER
                              Can't stand the pain. Help me.

                   In the near background, Sybok watches with Kirk and 
                   Spock. They are entranced by what they're seeing.

                                           McCOY
                              All my knowledge and I can't save 
                              him.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (the voice of conscience)
                              You've done all you can. The support 
                              system will keep him alive.

                                           McCOY
                                     (flaring)
                              You call this alive? Suspended be-
                              tween life and death by a bridge of 
                              pain?

                   Father whispers something. McCoy bends down and puts 
                   his ear next to the old man's parched lips.

                                           FATHER
                              Release... me...

                   McCoy looks into his father's eyes. The old man's gaze 
                   travels to the support machinery. He wants McCoy to 
                   shut it off.

                                           McCOY
                                     (recoiling)
                              I can't.
                                     (in agony)
                              But how can I watch him suffer like 
                              this?

                                           SYBOK
                              You're a doctor.

                                           McCOY
                                     (defiant)
                              I'm his son!

                   McCoy reaches his decision. He shuts off the machine. 
                   The father dies in his son's arms. Sybok appears at 
                   McCoy's side.

                                           SYBOK
                             Why did you do it?

                                           McCOY
                             To preserve his dignity.

                                           SYBOK
                             But that wasn't the worst of it was 
                             it?

                                           McCOY
                             No.

                                           SYBOK
                             Share it.

                   McCoy hesitates, trembling. This is his darkest secret.

                                           McCOY
                             Not long after... they found a cure. 
                             A goddamn cure!

                                           SYBOK
                             If you hadn't killed him, he might 
                             have lived.

                                           McCOY
                                     (breaking down)
                             No! I loved him!

                                           SYBOK
                             You did what you thought was right.

                                           McCOY
                             Yes! No!

                                           SYBOK
                             You must release this pain.

                   McCoy weeps for several moments, then wipes the 
                   tears away. He looks up at Sybok's comforting smile 
                   and is filled with a deep sense of relief.

                                           SYBOK
                             This pain has poisoned your soul for 
                             a long time. But now you've taken 
                             the first step. The other steps 
                             we'll take together.

                   McCoy nods. Sybok turns to Spock.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (continuing)
                              Each man's pain is unique.

                   They turn and find themselves beneath the hanging
                   stalagtites of a cave. Torchlight throws weird shadows 
                   on the walls. The shadows depict a woman in labor, 
                   attended by a Vulcan High Priestess. Ceremonial drums
                   pound a throbbing pulse. The woman lets out another
                   scream. It reverberates throughout the cavern.

                              I believe we are witnessing my
                              birth.

                   Sybok appears beside them. He leads Spock and Kirk
                   into the past.

                   Spock's mother, the young earthwoman AMANDA, lies on
                   a rough pallet, her legs spread beneath her robes, 
                   her distended stomach lifting. Her only attendent is
                   THE HIGH PRIESTESS who intones the Vulcan birthrights.

                   Spock watches.

                   A figure steps from the shadow. It is SAREK, Spock's
                   father. He observes his wife with typical detachment.

                   As the drums build in intensity, Amanda begins to 
                   deliver.

                   The birth takes place in shadow. Drums reach a climax
                   and stop. An infant cries. Amanda lifts the mewling
                   baby from between her legs.

                   She takes the baby from Amanda and holds it up. The 
                   tiny infant kicks and cries. Amanda reaches out for 
                   her child but the Priestess turns and presents the
                   crying baby to Sarek instead.

                                           SAREK

                   He takes the infant and lays it on Amanda's belly. 
                   Amanda beholds the child up close. As it thrashes 
                   against her, she see for the first time its tiny 
                   pointed ears.

                   From behind comes a faraway voice. The voice of 
                   young Sybok.

                              Spock...

                   Spock turns, unprepared for this. A figure regards him 
                   from a distance, a hood shadowing his features. It 
                   appears to be Sybok on the day he and Spock parted.

                              You know we'll never make it through 
                              the Barrier.

                                           SYBOK
                              But if we do, will that convince you 
                              that my vision was true?

                                           KIRK
                              What vision?

                                           SYBOK
                              Given to me by God.
                                     (as the others react)
                              He waits for us on the other side.

                                           KIRK
                                     (stunned)
                              You are mad.

                                           SYBOK
                              Am I? We'll see.

                   The fiery look in Sybok's eyes might be confidence, 
                   it might be madness. He turns and exits.

             188   EXT. SPACE - THE GREAT BARRIER                             188

                   Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant starcluster 
                   known as the Great Barrier. It is visibly stunning and 
                   equally dangerous. We see giant regions of star form-
                   ations as well as expanding blast waves from exploding 
                   stars. Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep the tiny 
                   and insignificant ship, bathing her in color.

             189   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN                  189

                   Sybok is on the Bridge, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu are at 
                   their stations. Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot are also 
                   present. They and the rest of the crew are transfixed 
                   by the viewscreen, awed by the vista of a sky filled 
                   with thousands of stars, each a fiery orange.

                   But what really draws their attention is the black 
                   thundercloud looming directly ahead. Here starts the 
                   ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of 
                   the galaxy, hiding it from view. Behind this black 
                   veil lies a region that emits ten times more energy
                   than our sun. Through the chinks in the wall we see 
                   flashes of blue light -- hints of the fires blazing 
                   within.

                   The ship's monitor screens go blank.

                                           SULU
                              They say no ship can survive it.

                                           SYBOK
                              I say they're wrong. I say the danger 
                              is an illusion.

                                           CHEKOV
                              We have no instrument readings. Is 
                              it there or isn't it?

                                           SYBOK

             190   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE                            190

                   And with that, the ship plows into the Barrier, straight 
                   into the dark clouds, disappearing from sight. We hold 
                   for a terrifying moment, wondering if we'll ever see 
                   Enterprise again.

             191   ANGLE - INSIDE THE BARRIER                                 191

                   Surprisingly, there is no turbulence, no buffeting. The
                   Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway of 
                   light and color. Then, quite suddenly, the gas clouds 
                   part and the ship enters a region of incredible calm and 
                   serenity, like the clear space at the eye of a hurricane.

             192   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   192

                   The crew experiences the euphoria of safe passage. A 
                   wave of joy washes over them.

             193   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM                              193

                   Kirk, Spock and McCoy feel the rush of happiness. 
                   They gaze through the window at this incredible 
                   spacescape, unable to deny the sensation stirring 
                   within them. Sybok was right.

             194   EXT. SPACE                                                 194

                   Dead ahead, a single planet. A planet of great beauty 
                   and peace. Our final destination.

             195   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   195

                   A burst of emotion. Crew members rejoice.

             196   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM                              196

                   Kirk, fascinated by the planet, moves to the antique 
                   ship's wheel. He absent-mindedly rests his hand on it. 
                   His eyes are drawn to the plaque attached to the 
                   spokes of the wheel. On it, the charter of the 
                   Enterprise has been set in bronze. Camera moves in on 
                   these words: TO GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

             197   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      197

             198   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN                  198

                   The Bridge buzzes with excitement. Monitor screens come 
                   to life.

                                           CHEKOV
                              Instruments are back on line. Incred-
                              ible. There's a power source emanating 
                              from the planet like nothing I've ever 
                              seen.

                   On the viewscreen, the planet appears up close -- a 
                   celestial orb, cloaked by swirling white clouds. 
                   Quick shots of awed reactions.

                   The bridge doors whoosh open to reveal Kirk, Spock and 
                   McCoy. The others turn, fearful of what he'll say or 
                   do. A tense moment, then:

                                           KIRK
                                     (to Sybok)
                              About the ship...

                              It needs its Captain.

                                           KIRK
                              No special conditions?

                                     (happily)

                              What makes you think I won't turn us 
                              around?

                                           SYBOK
                              Because you too, must know.

                   Kirk looks at the hopeful facts around him. He feels 
                   the excitement of being on the verge of a great 
                   frontier, perhaps the greatest frontier.

                                           KIRK
                              Then if we're going to do it...
                                     (with conviction)
                              ... we'll do it by the book. Chekov 
                              take the conn. Sulu, standard orbit 
                              approach. Uhura, alert the shuttle-
                              craft to stand by. Sybok, Spock and 
                              Doctor McCoy with me. The rest of 
                              you will remain on board until I've
                              determined what we're dealing with.

                   Kirk's eyes flash with excitement. To Sybok:

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing; with 
                                      a smile)
                              Well, don't just stand there. God's 
                              a busy man.

                   Sybok happily joins them in the turbolift.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   Bay doors open. Copernicus, the shuttle backup, 
                   emerges and drops from the mothership. Thrusters fire 
                   as it streaks toward the planet, disappearing into 
                   the swirling white clouds.

                   Spock pilots the craft. He, McCoy and Kirk have changed 
                   into Starfleet uniforms.

                   Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok descend into the bowl of 
                   the crater. They reach the center and stop. They look 
                   at each other wondering. "Is this all there is?" 
                   Sybok tries to hide his disappointment. He looks 
                   around for a sign that isn't there, then, after a 
                   moment of deafening silence, he addresses their bleak 
                   surroundings.

                                           SYBOK

                              We have travelled far by starship...

                   Nothing. It looks like a bust. Sybok's voice chokes 
                   off and he lowers his head. Kirk and McCoy frown at 
                   each other. Kirk whips out his communicator to 
                   address the ship.

                                           KIRK
                              Enterprise, this is Kirk...

                   Spock goes to Sybok and puts a comforting hand on his 
                   brother's shoulder.

                   Spock's words are obscured by a rumble from within 
                   the earth. A shadow engulfs the amphitheater.

                   The ground comes to life beneath the feet of our 
                   heroes. The earth buckles and ripples as if nature 
                   herself were trying to break free. Without warning 
                   a pillar of sheer rock rips up through the surface 
                   and climbs skyward. Then another pillar shoots up, 
                   followed by another and another. They encircle the
                   amphitheater like giant fingers. We intercut Kirk, 
                   Spock, McCoy, and Sybok reacting to this dazzling 
                   display of power

                   Within this primative cathedral Kirk, Spock, McCoy and 
                   Sybok watch as the ground in front of them melts like 
                   molten lava. It swirls, creating a vortex. A rushing 
                   sound comes from the planet's core, growing closer. 
                   Something of incredible power is on its way to the 
                   surface.

             220   ANGLE                                                      220

                   A shaft of energy explodes out of the vortex. It shoots 
                   skyward like an erupting geyser, blinding our heroes 
                   with its beauty and raw power.

             221   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - PLANET AND ENTERPRISE                 221

                   The energy shaft rises from the planet like a beacon 
                   light. Enterprise, just outside the shaft, is bathed 
                   in its reflection.

             222   INT. AMPHITHEATER                                          222

                   Sybok staggers back. Like Kirk, Spock and McCoy, he 
                   must shield his eyes from the intensity of the energy 
                   shaft.

             223   ENERGY SHAFT                                               223

                   It pulsates and throbs with life. A GOD-LIKE VOICE 
                   comes from within.

                                           VOICE
                              Brave souls. Welcome.

                   Startled reactions.

                                           McCOY
                                     (hushed)
                              Is this the voice of God?

                   As if responding to McCoy's question, the energy shaft 
                   throbs. From the swirling dust within it, a living form 
                   begins to take shape. The shape is powerful, beautiful, 
                   enticing.

                   Sybok and the others watch in wonder. The wind it kicks 
                   up causes them to stagger back.

             224   CLOSER ANGLE - ENERGY SHAFT                                224

                   Within this maelstrom of power, the form of humanity 
                   begins to take shape. And it takes on many forms, each 
                   reminding us of the holy paintings that have depicted 
                   the All-Mighty through the ages.

             225   A SERIES OF SHOTS                                          225

                   We intercut between the shifting images of God and the 
                   reactions of the Enterprise crew. One moment the figure 
                   is Ra. The next, Allah. He's black. White. Female. Male. 
                   Andorian. Klingon. Each witnesses a flash of his own 
                   God.

             226   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      226

                   They watch the "God Show" with mounting fascination.

             227   ENERGY SHAFT                                               227

                   The Being synthesizes into the Biblical Heavenly 
                   Father of our imagination. (Note: The Being is con-
                   tained within the perimeters of the energy shaft, 
                   unable to venture out of it.)

                   The Being turns his gaze to Sybok, Kirk, Spock and 
                   McCoy. He beams with pleasure. His eyes twinkle.

                                           BEING
                              Does this better suit your expect-
                              ations?

                   It does indeed. No one knows what to say. Sybok is vind-
                   icated, he can barely contain his ecstasy.

                                           SYBOK
                              Qual se tu?

                                           BEING
                              It is I.
                                     (a pause)
                              The journey you took to reach me 
                              could not have been an easy one.

                                           SYBOK
                              It was not. The Barrier stood between 
                              us -- but we breached it.

                                           BEING
                              Magnificent. You are the first to  
                              find me.

                                           SYBOK
                              We sought only your infinite wisdom.

                                           BEING
                              And how did you breach the Barrier?

                                           SYBOK
                              With a starship!
                         
                                           BEING
                              Ah. This starship... could it carry 
                              my wisdom beyond the Barrier?

                                           SYBOK
                              It could. Yes!

                                           BEING
                              Then I shall make use of this 
                              starship.

                                           SYBOK
                                     (thrilled)
                              It will be your chariot!

                   Kirk politely raises a hand.

                                           KIRK
                              Excuse me.

                                           BEING
                                     (ignoring Kirk)
                              It will carry my power to every 
                              corner of creation...

                                           KIRK
                                     (insistant)
                              Excuse me.

                   The Being regards Kirk like he was a pesky insect.

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                              I just wanted to ask a question.

                   McCoy looks at Kirk like he just farted in church.

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                              What does GOD need with a starship?

                   The Being returns his attention to Sybok.

                                           BEING
                              Bring the ship closer.

                                           KIRK
                              I said... what does God need with a
                              starship?

                                           McCOY
                              Jim, what're you doing?

                                           KIRK
                              I'm asking a question.

                   The Being once again regards Kirk. Kirk stands his 
                   ground.

                                           BEING
                              Who is this creature?

                                           KIRK
                              Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't 
                              you God?

                   The smile leaves The Being's face. Thunder rumbles 
                   faintly in the distance, underscoring his displeasure.

                                           SYBOK
                              He has his doubts...

                                           BEING
                              You doubt me?

                                           KIRK
                              I seek proof.

                                           McCOY
                              Jim, maybe you shouldn't ask him for 
                              his I.D.

                                           BEING
                              Then here is the proof you seek.

                   A bolt of energy shoots from the Being's eye and then
                   strikes Kirk full in the chest, knocking him to the
                   ground. Spock and McCoy look on in shock as Kirk, now
                   injured, tries to rise.

                                           KIRK
                                     (to Sybok)
                              Why... is God... angry?

                   Sybok is confounded. He addresses The Being.

                                           SYBOK
                              I don't understand. Why have you 
                              done this to my friend?

                                            BEING
                              He doubts me.

                   Spock takes it upon himself to step forward.

                                            SPOCK
                              You have not answered his question. 
                              What does God need with a starship?

                   The Being's countenance turns dark. Another bolt shoots 
                   from his eye and heads for Spock. Crash! Spock is
                   knocked to the ground.

             228   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   228

                   The crew can't comprehend this turn of events. Korrd, 
                   Caithlin and Talbot look at each other in horror.

             229   INT. AMPHITHEATER                                          229

                   The Being turns to McCoy.

                                           BEING
                              Do you doubt me?

                   McCoy looks at The Being's handiwork -- his injured 
                   friends.

                                           McCOY
                              I doubt any God who inflicts pain 
                              for his own pleasure.

                   The Being is on the verge of zapping McCoy when Sybok
                   interrupts.

                                           SYBOK
                              Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would 
                              not do this!

                   By way of reply. The Being smiles a truely wicked smile 
                   and Sybok realizes to his horror that he's been tricked.

                                           BEING
                              Sha Ka Ree?
                                     (scornful laughter)
                              An eternity I've been imprisoned in 
                              this place! The ship! I must have 
                              the ship! Now give me what I want!

                   Spock shouts to his brother.

                                           SPOCK
                              Sybok -- this is not the God of Sha 
                              Ka Ree -- or any other God!

                                           SYBOK
                              I don't understand...
                                     (to the Being)
                              Reveal yourself to me!

             230   ANGLE - THE BEING                                          230

                   Before our stunned eyes, the being changes into Sybok 
                   himself -- a dark sinister reflection of Sybok. This 
                   Evil Sybok laughs, enjoying the reaction.

                                           BEING
                              What's wrong? Don't you like this 
                              face? I have many but this one 
                              suits you best.

             231   ANGLE TO INCLUDE SYBOK                                     231

                   His self-realization is painful to behold.

                                           SYBOK
                              No... it's not possible.

                                           BEING
                              Bring me the ship or I will destroy 
                              you!

                                           SYBOK
                                     (realizing the Being's
                                      evil intention)
                              The ship...

                                           BEING
                              Bring it closer so that I might

                              No, Sybok!

                   Sybok raises his hand to Spock in the Vulcan gesture of 
                   farewell.

                              Forgive me.

                   Sybok turns to face the Being, gathering up all his 
                   power. Spock starts forward but Kirk holds him back.

                              Mister Spock, Klingon captain wishes 
                              to name his terms.

                   Klaa appears on the viewscreen arms folded across his 
                   chest, seated triumphantly in his command chair. He 
                   speaks English the first time.

                                           KLAA
                              This is Captain Klaa of the Klingon 
                              Empire.  Attempts to raise shields 
                              or arm weapons and I will destroy 
                              you. You are alive for a single 
                              reason. The renegade James T. Kirk!
                              Hand him over and I will spare your 
                              lives. My transporter stands ready 
                              to beam him aboard.

                              Captain Kirk is not among us.

                              I am a Vulcan. I cannot lie. Captain 
                              Kirk is on the planet below.

                              Then give me his co-ordinates!

                   Spock glimpses a possibility. He turns to Korrd and speaks 
                   with urgency.

                              You are his superior officer.

                                           KORRD
                              I can do nothing! I am a foolish old

                              Damn you, sir, you will try!

                   Korrd sees that  Spock will not take  no for an answer.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   Kirk scrambles from one hiding place to another as the 
                   rock creature pursues him, able to anticipate his every 
                   move.

             262   PINACLE                                                    262

                   With no where to go but up, Kirk scales a steep pinn-
                   acle. He climbs with agility and speed. He'd better. 
                   The pursuing creature is practically breathing fire 
                   up his ass.

             263   WIDE ANGLE SHOT                                            263

                   Kirk clambers to the top of the pinnacle and finds 
                   himself trapped. He always knew he'd die alone. The 
                   rock creature climbs up to get Kirk, an inhuman voice 
                   issuing from its flaming mouth.

                                           CREATURE
                              Give... me... the... ship.

                   A whooshing sound from overhead. Kirk looks up.

             264   ANGLE - SKY ABOVE                                          264

                   The Bird of Prey drops out of the storm clouds. Its 
                   guns come to life and strafe the rock creature, 
                   driving it back, away from Kirk.

             265   KIRK                                                       265

                   Vulnerable atop the pinnacle. The Bird of Prey hov- 
                   vers directly above him, its guns swivelling in his 
                   direction. Kirk is determined to go down fighting.

                                           KIRK
                                     (shouting in defiance)
                              So it's me you want, you Klingon 
                              bastards! Come and get me!

                   The Bird of Prey's transporter beam shimmers down and 
                   engulfs him. Kirk disappears in its sparkling light, 
                   saved from the rock creature who lets out an angry roar 
                   of defeat. The Bird of Prey takes off with its prize.

             266   INT. BIRD OF PREY - TRANSPORTER ROOM                       266

                   Kirk materializes. He's immediately seized by two brutal-
                   looking Klingons. They march him out of the transporter 
                   room.

             267   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE                                 267

                   The bridge doors slide open and Kirk is brought in The 
                   Klingon crew regard him from their stations. Klaa is 
                   off to one side looking petulant. Korrd stands beside  
                   him, chest puffed up with pride, obviously in charge. 
                   Why isn't Klaa in his command chair? Because someone 
                   else is occupying it.

                   The command chair swivels around to reveal its 
                   occupant to be Spock. He unstraps himself from 
                   the gunner's rig, stands up and straightens his 
                   uniform in a dignified manner.

                                           SPOCK
                              Welcome aboard, Captain.

                              Release him.

                   The guards step away from Kirk. Klaa glares at Korrd 
                   but it's clear the older Klingon is now calling the 
                   shots.

                   Kirk regards the stoic Spock with affection and 
                   wonder.

                                           KIRK
                                     (can't believe it)
                              Spock, I thought I was going to die.

                                           SPOCK
                              Not possible. You were never alone.

                   Kirk fights back tears and clasps his friend in a hug. 
                   Spock stiffens with embarassment.

                                           SPOCK
                              Please, Captain. Not in front of 
                              the Klingons.

                   Kirk laughs and hugs him all the harder. Spock tentat-
                   ively hugs him back.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                   A reception is in full swing. Spock and McCoy are dis-
                   covered off by themselves, standing at the observation 
                   window, gazing out at the God planet.

                              to you that the Great Barrier wasn't 
                              placed there to keep us out -- but 
                              to keep that thing in?

                                           SPOCK
                              It has occured to me.

                              Well, doesn't that imply the exist-
                              ence of a greater power?

                                           SPOCK
                              I will say this much Doctor. We have 
                              yet to reach the final frontier.

                   The Klingon polishes off a tumbler of fluid. He frowns. 
                   What he wants is a real drink. Scotty approaches him.

                                           SCOTTY
                              Would you care  for a wee nip of 
                              scotch whisky?

                                           KORRD
                              Umm...

                   Scotty produces a bottle and pours a splash into the 
                   Klingon's tumbler. Korrd downs it with obvious 
                   relish. Scotty smiles.

                                           SCOTTY
                              I never thought I'd be drinking with 
                              a Klingon.

                   Korrd chortles agreeably and moves off. We follow him 
                   over to Talbot and Caithlin.

                   He's been watching with satisfaction. As he turns, he 
                   notices Klaa eyeing him keenly from across the room -- 
                   the young gun locking eyes with the seasoned pro. With 
                   a smile, Kirk gives Klaa the Klingon salute.

                   Kirk notices Spock and McCoy still standing at the 
                   window, still staring out, oblivious to the party 
                   around them. Kirk approaches.

                              We were speculating...

                              ... is God really out there?

                              Maybe He's not out there, Bones. 
                              Maybe He's right here... in 
                              human heart.

                                      expression)
                              Spock?

                              I was thinking of Sybok.

                              I lost a brother once. But I was

                              I thought you said men like us 
                              don't have families.

                   Camera pulls back from a roaring campfire. McCoy pours 
                   two cupsful of bourbon and hands one to Kirk who sets 
                   aside his marshmallow on a stick. Kirk and McCoy clink 
                   cups in a silent toast and drink, distracted by strange 
                   plinking sounds from close by. Spock is revealed, 
                   absently strumming his Vulcan lute in search of a tune.

                                           KIRK
                                     (with a smile)
                              Well, are you just going to sit 
                              there and pick at it or are you 
                              going to play something?

                   The plinks and plunks gradually become a tune. The un-
                   mistakable "Row Your Boat." Kirk and McCoy react with 
                   delight. McCoy takes a hit of bourbon and clears his 
                   throat.

                                           McCOY
                                     (singing)
                              "Row, row, row your boat gently 
                              down the stream..."

                   Kirk jumps in and, when it's his turn, Spock joins 
                   the chorus too. The three shipmates sing loudly 
                   with feeling and gusto. Their voices climb into the 
                   night sky.

                                           VOICES
                              "... merrily, merrily, merrily, 
                              merrily, life is but a dream..."

                   As they continue to sing, we execute the greatest pull
                   back of all time. The campfire becomes a dot of light. 
                   The dot of light joins other dots of light. They become 
                   the stars of the universe.

                   AND THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES
                      
                                           THE END
