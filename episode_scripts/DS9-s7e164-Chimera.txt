1    EXT. SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)

	traveling at impulse.

2    INT. RUNABOUT

	ODO is in the cockpit, studying a small GLASS
	KNICKKNACK. As he holds it up to the light, its
	faceted surface twinkles with color.

	O'BRIEN ENTERS from the back, having just woken from
	a nap. He's wearing his hand phaser.

					O'BRIEN
				(moving to the
				replicator)
			How long was I asleep?

					ODO
			Almost two hours.

	O'Brien's surprised to hear he was asleep that long,
	gets a MUG of coffee from the replicator.

					O'BRIEN
				(noticing)
			You dropped out of warp -- we
			must be getting close to home.

					ODO
				(nods)
			We entered the Bajoran system a
			few minutes ago.

					O'BRIEN
				(taking a seat)
			What's that?

					ODO
			The shopkeeper I bought it from
			called it a knickknack.

					O'BRIEN
			I didn't know you collected
			knickknacks.

          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 TEASER          2.

2    CONTINUED:

					ODO
			It's a present for Kira.

	O'Brien's features falter at hearing this.

					ODO
				(misunderstanding)
			You don't think she'll like it?

					O'BRIEN
			I'm sure she will. It's just...
			I didn't get anything for Keiko.

					ODO
				(trying to make him 
				feel better)
			The conference kept you pretty
			busy...

					O'BRIEN
				(kicking himself)
			You made time to get something.

	O'Brien's eyes fall to a small wooden BOX sitting on
	the console next to Odo, labeled with alien lettering.

					O'BRIEN
			Not chocolates too?

					ODO
			Rigelian chocolates. Her
			favorite.

	O'Brien eyes them for a beat.

					O'BRIEN
			I'll buy them from you.

					ODO
			I beg your pardon?

					O'BRIEN
			I'll buy them from you. Come on,
			Odo, you don't need to give Kira
			two presents. We were only gone
			a day.

					ODO
			I'm sorry, but the answer's no.

	O'Brien is about to protest when a proximity ALARM
	SOUNDS and the ship goes to RED ALERT -- both men
	turn to their consoles to find out what it is.

 DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - TEASER         3.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			There's something behind us.

					ODO
			And it's gaining fast.

3    EXT. SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)

	as a spacefaring LIFEFORM rapidly approaches. Its
	body is smooth and cylindrical, and it propels
	itself with a pulsating motion. As it "swims"
	alongside the Runabout, we see that it's almost as
	big as the ship.

4    INT. RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)

	THROUGH THE WINDOW, Odo and O'Brien see the creature
	swimming in front of the runabout.

					O'BRIEN
			You think it's friendly?

					ODO
			I hope so.

					O'BRIEN
			It certainly seems to have taken
			an interest in us.

	Suddenly the creature DROPS BACK OUT OF THEIR SIGHT.
	A beat, then it SLAMS against the side of the
	runabout, JOSTLING them in their seats.

					O'BRIEN
			Uh-oh.

					ODO
				(off console)
			It's gone.

					O'BRIEN
			What?

					ODO
				(puzzled)
			According to the sensors, there's
			nothing out there.

					O'BRIEN
			Where'd it go?

         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - TEASER         4.

4    CONTINUED:

	A strange SOUND from behind them gets their
	attention. They exchange puzzled looks, move to
	investigate. Suddenly the SOUND again, from a
	different part of the runabout. It's almost like
	something is moving around behind the walls.

	The SOUND again, this time from near a VENT situated
	near the back of the compartment.

	They move to it cautiously. As they lean close to
	listen, a mass of changeling PROTOPLASM suddenly
	SHOOTS from the vent.

5    ODO AND O'BRIEN

	as they jump back, turn to look behind them.

					ODO
			A changeling.

6    THE CHANGELING (OPTICAL)

	as it MORPHS into humanoid form. Although its face
	is similar to Odo's in that its features are smooth
	and somewhat ill-defined, it's modeled on a humanoid
	species we've never seen before.

	It's definitely male, and we get the sense that he's a
	bit more adept at mimicking faces than Odo, as his
	features are more expressive. He wears alien-looking
	CLOTHES that are more practical than decorative.

	O'Brien trains his weapon on him, but the
	changeling's attention is fixed on Odo alone. Off
	this moment, we...

									FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)

7    INT. RUNABOUT - MOMENTS LATER

	O'Brien keeps his weapon trained on the intruder,
	whose eyes are fixed on Odo. The Changeling carries
	himself with a proud bearing, and when he speaks
	it's with a direct, urgent manner.

					O'BRIEN
			Stay where you are, or I'll fire.

	The Changeling ignores him, stares at Odo.

					CHANGELING
			You -- you're a Metamorph?

					ODO
			I'm a changeling, yes.

	The Changeling can't believe he's finally found
	another of his kind.

					CHANGELING
				(to Odo)
			Tell the mono-form to put down
			its weapon.

	Odo isn't about to do any such thing until he gets
	some answers.

					ODO
			Why did you board our ship?

					CHANGELING
			Because I sensed you were here.
			I had to see if it was true -- if
			I'd finally found another
			Metamorph.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE         6.

7    CONTINUED:

					ODO
			You've never met another
			Shape-shifter?

					CHANGELING
				(stepping forward)
			I've been trying to find others
			of my kind for a long time.

					O'BRIEN
				(brandishing his
				phaser)
			I told you to stay where you
			were.

	O'Brien can see that Odo's starting to believe the
	Changeling's story, but he's not so sure.

					O'BRIEN
			How do we know he's not a
			Founder?

	The Changeling doesn't seem to recognize the word.

					ODO
			He isn't.
				(trusting his
				instincts)
			He's one of the hundred.

					CHANGELING
			The hundred?

					ODO
			Over the centuries, our people
			sent a hundred "infant"
			changelings out into the galaxy.
			We were to learn about other
			species, and eventually return
			home to share what we'd
			experienced.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE         7.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

	The Changeling tries to make sense of what he's
	being told.

					CHANGELING
			That would explain why I was
			alone on Varala.
				(to Odo)
			I didn't even know what I was at
			first... or that I could assume
			other forms.

	Odo can't help but be drawn in by someone who shared
	the same experiences he did.

					ODO
			I was the same way.

	O'Brien can see that Odo's buying the Changeling's
	story, but he's not convinced.

					O'BRIEN
			Odo, I hate to interrupt... but
			shouldn't we get him in a
			containment field until we're
			sure he's telling the truth?

	Part of Odo knows he's right, but his instincts are
	telling him it isn't necessary.

					CHANGELING
				(to Odo)
			I'll allow myself to be taken
			prisoner to show my good faith,
			but only if you vouch for my
			safety.
				(eyeing O'Brien)
			I don't trust humanoids.

	Odo nods, sealing the deal. Off this moment...

8    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE         8.

9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Odo has told SISKO about the changeling, and the
	captain is wary about what he's heard.

					SISKO
			Where's is he now?

					ODO
			In a holding cell.

	Odo sees that Sisko is understandably concerned
	about this mysterious changeling, does his best to
	put him at ease.

					ODO
			Captain, he's not a threat to us.
			He's just a changeling who's
			traveled a long way to find out
			where he came from.

					SISKO
			So you believe his story?

					ODO
			Yes, sir.

	But Sisko is unconvinced.

					SISKO
			How can we be sure he's not a
			Founder?

					ODO
			If he were, he'd be infected with
			the same disease that's
			afflicting the entire Link. I
			had Doctor Bashir scan him. His
			morphogenic matrix is as stable
			as mine.

	Sisko considers this for a beat...

					ODO
			Sir, with your permission, I'd
			like to release him.

					SISKO
			Constable, I'm sure you can
			appreciate why I'd have
			reservations about that. We're
			at war with your people. And the
			Founders have deceived us before.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        8A.

9    CONTINUED:

					ODO
			I realize that. But he's not a
			Founder. He's one of the
			hundred, I'm sure of it.
				(beat)
			Sir, I'm asking you to trust me
			on this.

	Sisko studies Odo for a beat; he can see how much
	this means to him. Fighting his reservations, he
	gives in because he feels he owes it to Odo.

					SISKO
			All right, Constable.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE         9.

9    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO (Cont'd)
			I'm releasing him into your
			custody.

	Odo's elated, but as always, he doesn't show it.

					ODO
			Thank you, sir.

	Off Sisko as he watches Odo go, hoping he's doing
	the right thing...

10   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL

	Odo and the Changeling walk and talk.

					ODO
			-- when I found out our people
			were the leaders of the Dominion,
			I realized I had no place with
			them. This war they're fighting
			is wrong.

					CHANGELING
			I can understand their distrust
			of humanoids, but why try to
			conquer them?
				(glancing at the
				passersby)
			Better to avoid them altogether.

					ODO
			You don't much care for
			humanoids.

					CHANGELING
			I know from experience they don't
			much care for changelings.

					ODO
			I think you'll find the people
			here are different.

					CHANGELING
			Oh?

					ODO
			They've accepted me.

	The Changeling looks skeptical.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        10.

10   CONTINUED:

					CHANGELING
			Have they?
				(beat)
			Is that why you've stayed?

	Odo isn't sure what he means.

					ODO
			I told you, I want no part of the
			Founders.

					CHANGELING
			But what about the hundred that
			were sent out -- haven't you ever
			tried to find any of them?

					ODO
			No.

	The Changeling seems surprised to hear this.

					ODO
			It's a big galaxy. They could be
			anywhere.

					CHANGELING
			I found you.

	Odo finds himself feeling a bit defensive.

					ODO
			I have a life here, friends.

	The Changeling begins to realize something...

					CHANGELING
			When did you first take humanoid
			form?

					ODO
			A little over thirty years ago.

					CHANGELING
			So that's it. This is all still
			new to you. I spent the first
			part of my life living among
			humanoids, as well.

					ODO
			How long ago was that?

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        11.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

					CHANGELING
			Over two hundred years.
				(off Odo's surprise)
			I must've been sent out earlier
			than you.

					ODO
				(trying to make
				sense of it)
			Or it could be that I was adrift
			for a long time before I was
			found.

					CHANGELING
			Either way, it explains why
			you've chosen to stay here. I
			was fascinated by humanoid life
			in the beginning, too.

	Being treated like a "youngster" doesn't sit well
	with Odo.

					ODO
			But you... lost interest.

					CHANGELING
			I found it... limiting.
				(besides)
			The Varalans never accepted me as
			one of them. I wasn't able to
			fully mimic their appearance.

					ODO
			Faces aren't easy.

					CHANGELING
			No. And humanoids aren't very
			tolerant of difference.

					ODO
			Some of them are. There are
			dozens of species living on this
			station, and they tolerate each
			other's differences quite well.

					CHANGELING
				(glancing around)
			He has bumps on his forehead and
			she has a wrinkled nose -- but
			they're basically alike. They're
			bipeds that eat, sleep and
			breathe. You and I are nothing
			like them.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        12.

10   CONTINUED:	(3)

	Odo doesn't see the problem --

					ODO
			We're changelings. We can be
			like them when we choose.

					CHANGELING
			I choose to do so as little as
			possible. That's where we differ.

	Odo lets this go because he has no desire to argue
	with him.

					ODO
			Why don't I show you where you'll
			be staying?

	The Changeling nods, and we cut to --

11   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	as Odo and the Changeling ENTER.

					ODO
			You haven't told me your name.

					CHANGELING
			The Varalans called me Laas. In
			their language it means
			"changeable." Not very
			imaginative, is it?

					ODO
			At least it's appropriate. My
			name means "unknown sample." The
			scientist who found me didn't
			know what I was.

11A  INT. ODO'S QUARTERS

	They ENTER.

					ODO
			These are my quarters. I'll be
			staying...
				(with Kira, but he'd
				rather not get into
				it)
			-- somewhere else. Feel free to
			shape-shift as you please.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE       12A.

11A  CONTINUED:

					ODO (cont'd)
			Some of these forms are quite
			interesting.

	The Changeling runs his hand along the jungle-gym,
	detecting a thin layer of dust.

					CHANGELING
			This hasn't been used in some
			time.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        13.

11A  CONTINUED:	(2)

	For some reason Odo finds himself feeling defensive
	around this man, and his simple statement of fact
	feels to him like an accusation.

					ODO
			I've been busy.

	The Changeling notices a PICTURE of Kira sitting on
	Odo's computer console.

					CHANGELING
			Who's this?

					ODO
			Her name's Kira.

	The Changeling studies the picture for a beat
	without comment.

					CHANGELING
			I had a mate once.

					ODO
				(surprised)
			Oh?

					CHANGELING
			On Varala. Not long after I
			assumed humanoid form.

					ODO
			What happened?

					CHANGELING
			We couldn't have children. That
			was important to her.

	This is a touchy subject for Odo, something he's
	wondered about in his relationship with Kira.

					CHANGELING
				(with characteristic bluntness)
			Is it something that matters to
			this Kira?

					ODO
			We've never discussed it.

					CHANGELING
			Neither did we, at first.

	Without his meaning to, the Changeling's words twist
	Odo's heart.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        14.

11A  CONTINUED:	(3)

					CHANGELING
			Do our people reproduce?

					ODO
			It's a little more complicated
			than that. In our natural state,
			we don't exist as separate entities.

					CHANGELING
			I don't understand.

					ODO
			Our people spend most of their
			time in the Link.

					CHANGELING
			The Link?

					ODO
			It involves... a melding into one
			-- the merging of thought and
			form, idea and sensation.

					CHANGELING
			You're speaking in riddles.

					ODO
			It's difficult to explain.

					CHANGELING
			Then don't. Show me.

					ODO
			Of course.

	Odo realizes that the Changeling's right, there's no
	need to use words. But why didn't he think of it
	himself?

	Odo approaches the Changeling and extends his hand
	to him.

					ODO
			Take it.

	Without hesitation, he reaches and clasps Odo's
	hand.

12   CLOSE - THEIR HANDS (OPTICAL)

	Odo's hand begins to MORPH around the Changeling's.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE        15.

13   THE CHANGELING

	reacts to the sensation. Then as if by instinct, he
	allows --

14   HIS HAND (OPTICAL)

	to go to a GELATINOUS state and merge with Odo's.

15   ODO

	His features are calm, almost solemn, as if he
	understands that it's a sacred trust to share the
	Link with a changeling who hasn't experienced it
	before.

16   ODO AND THE CHANGELING (OPTICAL)

	As their bodies start to come together into A SINGLE
	MASS OF ROILING SHAPESHIFTER ENERGY...

									DISSOLVE TO:

16A  INT. ODO'S QUARTERS - LATER (FORMERLY SCENE 17)

	The Changeling is standing at the window staring out
	at the stars. Odo watches from a discreet distance,
	knowing he's gone through a profound experience.

					CHANGELING
			For the first time in my life...
			I understand how I was meant to
			exist...

	The Changeling turns to look at Odo.

					CHANGELING
			You've given up a great deal to
			stay here.

	For the first time ever, Odo's met someone who can
	fully understand that fact.

					ODO
			I have.
				(beat)
			But I won't have anything to do
			with the Founders and their war.

	The Changeling fixes him with a knowing look.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT ONE       15A.

16A  CONTINUED:

					CHANGELING
			Odo, we Linked. I know the
			truth. You've stayed because of
			Kira. If it wasn't for her,
			you'd be with our people. War or
			no war, you'd be a Founder.

	Ode's never had to face this truth about himself,
	never had to hear it put into words. Off his face
	as he struggles with what it means, we...

18   INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	Odo is sitting at his desk, lost in thought, a few
	PADDs all but ignored in front of him. A moment,
	then KIRA ENTERS.

					KIRA
			Hi.

	Odo snaps out of his reverie, offers her a smile.

					ODO
			Hello, Nerys.

					KIRA
				(happy for him)
			I can't believe it. Another
			changeling. What's he like?

					ODO
			He's... complicated.

					KIRA
				(gently teasing)
			Like you.

	She takes his hand, smiles. A beat, then she senses
	something.

					KIRA
			Are you all right?

					ODO
			I'm fine.

					KIRA
			You seem... far away.

	A beat, then Odo tells her why.

					ODO
			We Linked.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO        18.

18   CONTINUED:

	This is the first Kira's heard of it, and she's not
	sure what to make of it.

					KIRA
			I see.

	Odo realizes why she might be worried about it.

					ODO
			There's nothing to worry about.
			He's not a Founder, he's not
			trying to lure me to the
			Dominion.

	She nods, trying to shake off the unease she feels.

					ODO
			The Link is part of what we are.
			It comes as naturally to us as
			talking does to humanoids.

	Kira can't help feeling a little insecure about the
	fact that she's not capable of sharing it with him.

					KIRA
			It's a little more... personal
			than talking, isn't it?

					ODO
			I suppose...

					KIRA
			So. Do I get to meet him?

	Odo has the uneasy feeling that this meeting may not
	go well.

					ODO
			If you like.

					KIRA
			I would.

					ODO
			Then I'll arrange it.

	And off this moment...

19   INT. QUARK'S

	Kira is at the bar with BASHIR, EZRI and O'Brien.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO        19.

19   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			There they are.

	Odo and the Changeling approach from the entrance to
	the Promenade. The Changeling seems less than
	thrilled to be here, but he's going along for Odo's
	sake.

					ODO
			This is Laas.

               KIRA                               BASHIR
     Nerys.                                Julian.

					EZRI
			Ezri.

					O'BRIEN
			Miles.

					CHANGELING
				(even)
			We've met.

	O'Brien tries to put what happened behind them.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, I'm sorry. We didn't know
			who you were at first. You gave
			us a bit of a scare when you
			rammed the runabout.

	The Changeling says nothing to let O'Brien off the
	hook. A beat, then Ezri tries to keep things going.

					EZRI
			I've always wondered how it would
			feel to be able to fly through
			space like that.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO        20.

19   CONTINUED:	(2)

					CHANGELING
				(matter of fact)
			It's a shame you're incapable of
			experiencing it.

					EZRI
				(put off)
			Guess so...

	Odo stares at the Changeling, wishing he'd try a
	little harder to make conversation. Another
	uncomfortable silence, then Kira steps into the
	breach.

					KIRA
			Tell us about Varala.

					BASHIR
			No Federation ship's ever been
			there.

					CHANGELING
			It's just like any other planet
			that's overrun with humanoids.
			Cities and farms everywhere --
			other lifeforms displaced from
			their habitats. I once migrated
			to the southern continent with a
			herd of volg. By the time we
			returned to the breeding grounds
			the next summer, they'd been
			fenced off. The herd died out
			within two generations.

	Our people don't know quite what to say.

					CHANGELING
			It's the same on any planet where
			humanoids thrive. They disrupt
			the natural balance.

	Just then, Quark arrives with a plate.

					QUARK
			Who ordered the vilm-steak?

	An awkward moment...

					BASHIR
			Just... keep it warm for me.

					QUARK
			Whatever you say...

	Quark moves off.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO       20A.

19   CONTINUED:	(3)

					CHANGELING
			The truth is, I prefer the so-
			called primitive lifeforms. They
			exist as they were meant to,
			following their instincts. No
			words to get in the way, no lies
			or deceptions.

					O'BRIEN
			We're not the ones who can
			disguise ourselves as anything we
			want.

	After all the things the Changeling's said to him
	about humanoids, Odo finds that he's not sure how to
	take this.

					ODO
			Meaning?

					CHANGELING
			Meaning Shape-shifters aren't to
			be trusted.

	An uncomfortable moment as O'Brien chafes at having
	his words twisted around.

					O'BRIEN
			I trust Odo.

					CHANGELING
			Of course you trust Odo. Look at
			him. You've convinced him that
			he's as limited as you are.

					ODO
			Laas.

					EZRI
				(playfully)
			He's seen through our evil plan.

					BASHIR
			Foiled again.

					KIRA
			It's not funny.

					CHANGELING
			No, I'm worried for him.

					KIRA
			Odo can take care of himself.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO       20B.

19   CONTINUED:	(4)

	Odo decides to pull the plug on the evening before
	it gets any worse.

					ODO
			Well. Thank you, colonel. It's
			been interesting. We should be
			going now. If you'll excuse us,
			colonel, counselor, chief,
			doctor.
				(standing)
			I'm glad we came by.
				(turning to the
				door)
			Laas...

	With a last look our people's way, the Changeling
	heads for the door. Odo glances at Kira
	apologetically, then follows.

					0'BRIEN
				(can't resist)
			Nice to see you again.

	And off our people as they exchange what-was-that-all-
	about looks...

20   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL

	Odo is confronting the Changeling over what happened
	in Quark's.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO        21.

20   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			Was it really necessary to insult
			my friends?

					CHANGELING
			I was merely speaking my mind.

					ODO
			You could call it that.

					CHANGELING
			Humanoids are tragic creatures.
			They've lost the ability to take
			joy from simply existing... yet
			they haven't evolved to the next
			level -- where consciousness 
			exists independent of form.

					ODO
			You're certainly not afraid to
			make grand generalizations.

					CHANGELING
			I've been many things in my time.
			I speak from experience.

	The Changeling turns to Odo, sees that he's
	unconvinced. He smiles, extends his hand.

					CHANGELING
			Enough talk. Link with me.

					ODO
			Here?

					CHANGELING
			Why not?

					ODO
			I don't think that's a good idea.

	The Changeling sees Odo glance at some passersby,
	realizes the problem.

					CHANGELING
			You're embarrassed.

	It's true, but Odo doesn't want to admit it.

					ODO
			No...

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO        22.

20   CONTINUED:	(2)

					CHANGELING
			You don't want to do anything to
			remind them that you're not truly
			a humanoid.

					ODO
			I don't go out of my way to point
			it out, no.

					CHANGELING
			Why? Are you afraid they'll
			reject you?

					ODO
				(defensive)
			I don't like to confront people
			with something that might make
			them uncomfortable.

					CHANGELING
			So you deny your true nature in
			order to fit in.

					ODO
			You're reading too much into it.

					CHANGELING
			Before I came here, when was the
			last time you assumed another
			form?

	Odo hesitates, and that's answer enough for the
	Changeling.

					CHANGELING
			You can't even remember. You've
			been pretending to be a humanoid
			for so long, it doesn't occur to
			you that you can be anything
			else.

					ODO
			That's not true. I've been
			involved with other things
			lately.

					CHANGELING
			Like what? Courting Kira? She
			can't even Link with you.

					ODO
			Leave her out of this.

					CHANGELING
			It won't last.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT TWO        23.

20   CONTINUED:	(3)

					ODO
			The fact that your relationship
			failed doesn't mean mine will.

					CHANGELING
			True. If you're lucky, you'll
			get to watch her grow old and
			die.

					ODO
			I think you should stay out of my
			affairs.

					CHANGELING
			Odo, I don't want to see you make
			the same mistakes I made. You're
			wasting your time trying to be a
			humanoid. You're limiting
			yourself.

	The Changeling takes him by the shoulder, tries to
	convince him that there's a better way.

					CHANGELING
			Let's leave, Odo. Let's find the
			others. A hundred were sent away
			-- they're out there somewhere,
			and if we can find even a few of
			them, we can form a new Link.
			Think of it. We can exist the
			way we were meant to. As
			Changelings.

	And off Odo's face as he grapples with what he's
	being offered, we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

21   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	Since her promotion to colonel, Kira has taken up
	residence in a larger set of quarters, the three
	window kind. Her belongings from her old quarters
	are in evidence here, as well as some recent
	acquisitions, including the knickknack Odo gave her.

	Odo and Kira are sitting close on the couch, sharing
	an intimate moment.

					KIRA
			I can't believe he actually
			thought you'd drop everything and
			leave with him.

					ODO
			He just can't understand why I'd
			want to stay.

					KIRA
			How'd he take it when you said
			no?
				(off Odo's hesitation)
			You did say no, didn't you?

					ODO
			I told him I'd think about it.
				(quickly pointing out why)
			I didn't want to dismiss it out of
			hand. He would've taken offense.

	Kira studies his face...

					ODO
			Why are you looking at me like
			that?

					KIRA
			It bothers me that he thinks
			you're not happy here.
				(troubled)
			It makes me wonder if he knows
			something I don't.

					ODO
			What makes you say that?

					KIRA
			He Linked with you.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT THREE       25.

21   CONTINUED:

	Odo realizes what she's getting at, and that it
	troubles her deeply.

					KIRA
			Something about it must've given
			him the impression that you might
			want to leave.

					ODO
			It was just wishful thinking on
			his part. The thought of the two
			of us going off together to find
			the others --
				(getting caught up in it)
			-- exploring the galaxy as
			changelings, it's very alluring.
				(catching himself)
			To him.

					KIRA
			Sounds like it's alluring to you,
			too.

					ODO
				(gently reassuring her)
			I'm happy here.

	A moment, then he pulls her close. Kira snuggles
	against his chest for a quiet moment.

					KIRA
			I'm sorry I can't Link with you.

	Even as she says it, she knows the answer -- how
	could he not want that? Odo doesn't see any point
	in saying it out loud and hurting her feelings, and
	so he says the only thing he can say.

					ODO
			It doesn't matter, Nerys... I
			love you...

	And it's answer enough. Off the image of them
	holding each other close, each lost in their own
	thoughts...

	as Odo approaches the door to his quarters.

23   INT. ODO'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	as Odo ENTERS and stops short when he sees a FLAME
	burning in the center of the room, suspended about
	a few feet off the ground.

					ODO
				(instinctively)
			Computer, activate fire
			suppression sys--

	He trails off when the FLAME FLICKERS brightly,
	almost as if in reaction to his words. Then it hits
	him -- fire doesn't float in the air, the flame is
	the Changeling.

					ODO
			Laas... ?

24   CLOSE - THE FLAME (PRACTICAL EFFECT)

	as it FLICKERS again in response.

25   ODO

	stares at it, takes a step closer.

				ODO
			I need to talk to you...

	We hear the SOUND of an off-screen morph, then cut
	to --

26   THE CHANGELING (OPTICAL)

	as he just finishes MORPHING into humanoid form. He
	studies Odo for a beat with a knowing smile.

					CHANGELING
			You didn't realize it was me.
			Did you even know we could exist
			as fire?

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT THREE       27.

26   CONTINUED:

	In truth, Odo didn't.

					CHANGELING
			I didn't think so. No matter.
			Once we're away from here, I'll
			teach you to become things you've
			never even dreamed of.

	He smiles, relishing the thought of the quest
	they're about to embark on.

					ODO
			I'm not leaving. I'm staying
			here.

	The Changeling can't believe Odo would make such a
	mistake.

					CHANGELING
				(anger flaring)
			Why? So you can keep pretending
			to be one of them?

	Odo doesn't rise to the bait, he's not going to
	defend his life here because he doesn't feel he has
	to.

					ODO
			I'm sorry if you're disappointed.

	The Changeling dismisses this with a wave of his
	hand.

					CHANGELING
			I'll survive.
				(beat)
			When I find some of the others,
			I'll send for you.
				(sure of it)
			You'll change your mind and join
			us.

					ODO
			It could be a long time before
			you find another Changeling.

					CHANGELING
			Is that supposed to discourage
			me?

					ODO
			All I'm saying is that you don't
			have to leave right away.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT THREE      27A.

26     CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO (cont'd)
			I wouldn't mind the company of
			another Changeling. I'm sure you
			wouldn't either.

	Odo's right, but the Changeling can't resist
	needling him.

					CHANGELING
			All right, Odo, I won't abandon
			you to these mono-forms.
				(wry smile)
			As a favor to you, I'll stay for
			a while.

					ODO
				(dry)
			You might as well. If you can't
			get along with me, what makes you
			think you'll get along with any
			other Changeling?

	This elicits a rare smile from the Changeling.

					CHANGELING
			True enough.
				(beat)
			Just remember, I have no interest
			in mono-forms, even if they are
			your "friends."

					ODO
			After what happened in Quark's, I
			don't think you have to worry
			about an overcrowded social
			schedule.

					CHANGELING
			Good.

28   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

29   INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	Odo is working at his desk, studying a PADD. A
	beat, then something catches his attention out on
	the Promenade.

30   INT. PROMENADE

	The area is covered with a thick GROUND FOG. TWO
	BAJORAN CHILDREN run and play in it, until their
	MOTHER rushes out and pulls them away. TWO KLINGONS
	can be seen surveying the goings on suspiciously.

31   O'BRIEN AND BASHIR

	stand in the center of the Promenade, puzzled by the
	mist swirling around their feet.

					O'BRIEN
				(annoyed)
			Great. The environmental
			system's out again.

					BASHIR
			There goes our holosuite
			reservation...

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT THREE       29.

31   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			I'm going to find out what the
			problem is.

	Odo steps toward them.

					ODO
			Don't bother, Chief. There's
			nothing wrong with the
			environmental system.

					O'BRIEN
			Then where's this fog coming
			from?

					ODO
			It's not fog. It's Laas.

					O'BRIEN
				(unnerved)
			Laas?

	Bashir and O'Brien exchange an uncomfortable look --
	there's something creepy about knowing there's a
	lifeform swirling at your feet.

					BASHIR
			What's he doing?

	Odo's annoyed with Laas for doing this, but even so,
	he's a little irked by their reactions.

					ODO
			Being fog, what's it look like?

					O'BRIEN
			Can't he be fog somewhere else?

					BASHIR
			Or at night, when no one's
			around?

					ODO
			He's not hurting anyone.

					O'BRIEN
			Still. It's... creepy.

					BASHIR
				(re: the fog)
			Careful, Miles. He might hear
			you.

31     CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			Good.

	With that, they move off. Odo frowns at the fog,
	addresses it.

					ODO
			Laas.

	The fog ignores him.

					ODO
			Laas.

32   THE FOG (PRACTICAL EFFECT)

	as it starts to SWIRL and COALESCE at a single point
	on the Promenade.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "'Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT THREE      30.

33   ODO

33B  ODO

	as he crosses away from the Klingons, toward the
	point where the fog is coming together.

34   THE CHANGELING (OPTICAL)

	as he just finishes MORPHING into humanoid form.
	Odo approaches him with a frown.

					ODO
			Congratulations. You managed to
			disrupt the entire Promenade.

					CHANGELING
			I was just relaxing.

					ODO
			If you want to "relax," do it in
			private.

					CHANGELING
			Did I embarrass you? 

	Suddenly a voice rings out

					KLINGON
			Ka'vek! (You there!)

	Odo and the Changeling turn to see the two Klingons
	standing nearby.

					KLINGON
			What is that Founder doing here?

					ODO
			He's not a Founder. Now move
			along.

	The Klingon knows better than to tangle with Odo,
	but he can't resist a parting shot the Changeling's
	way.

       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT THREE       31.

34   CONTINUED:

					KLINGON
			Don't change form in my presence
			again.

					CHANGELING
			I change form where I please.

	The Klingon bristles, glaring at the Changeling.

					CHANGELING
				(to Odo)
			Look at him. Look at the hate in
			his eyes.

					ODO
			Laas.

					KLINGON
			Your hands are stained with the
			blood of Klingon warriors.

					CHANGELING
				(raising his hands
				palm up)
			But then, the stench would still
			be on them.

					KLINGON
			P'tak!

	The Klingon unsheathes the KNIFE hanging from his
	belt, brandishes it threateningly. The moment hangs
	in the air for a beat, then the Changeling holds up
	his hand and --

34A  A KNIFE MORPHS (OPTICAL)

	into his grip.

					CHANGELING
			Mine's bigger.

					KLINGON
				(defend yourself!)
			Ke'chaw!

	Odo lunges forward, disarming the Klingon.

35   THE SECOND KLINGON

	goes for his belt -- from which hang both a KNIFE
	and a DISRUPTOR.

36   THE CHANGELING

	reacts instinctively, snaps his arm toward the
	second Klingon. We hear a sharp metallic SOUND and
	cut to --

37   THE SECOND KLINGON

	impaled on the BLADE of the Changeling's knife,
	which he's extended by a few feet.

38   ODO

	reacting to this deadly turn of events.

41   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Sisko, Odo and WORF are discussing what happened.

					SISKO
				(grim)
			Doctor Bashir wasn't able to save
			the Klingon's life. General
			Martok has asked that Laas be
			detained until the magistrate has
			determined jurisdiction.

					ODO
			Jurisdiction?

					SISKO
			The Klingons want to extradite
			him.

					ODO
			That's ridiculous. He killed
			that Klingon in self-defense.

					WORF
			That is in dispute.

					ODO
			He was about to draw his
			disruptor.

					WORF
			According to the other Klingon,
			he was reaching for his dagger.

					SISKO
				(to Odo)
			Are you saying that's not true?

					ODO
			It happened too fast. But their
			intentions were obvious. One of
			them put a knife in his chest.

					SISKO
			The Klingons are arguing that
			since Laas knew he couldn't be
			harmed by a knife, he wasn't
			justified in responding with
			deadly force.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       34.

41   CONTINUED:

	Odo's heard enough -- it's clear to him what's
	really going on.

					ODO
			Since when do Klingons resort to
			legal quibbling? They get
			involved in fights all the time
			and never file charges. It isn't
			"honorable."

	Odo's right, but neither Sisko nor Worf seem too
	interested in questioning their motives.

					SISKO
			In this case, they're choosing to
			exercise their rights under the
			law.

					ODO
			Sir, they're only doing this
			because they distrust
			changelings.

					WORF
			He should not have provoked them.

					ODO
			Provoked them? They attacked
			Laas.

					SISKO
				(off a PADD)
			They're claiming that he
			"surrounded them menacingly."

	It takes Odo a moment to realize what they mean.

					ODO
			They felt menaced? By fog?

	But Sisko doesn't dismiss it that easily.

					SISKO
			They weren't the only ones.
			Twelve other people filed
			complaints.

					ODO
			Is it a crime to shape-shift on
			the Promenade?

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       35.

41   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			It may not be a crime, but
			obviously it's not a good idea.

	Odo stares at Sisko in disbelief. All the things
	Laas has said to him about how humanoids hate
	changelings are echoing in his head.

					ODO
			You're going to allow the
			Klingons extradite him... knowing
			they won't give him a fair
			trial...

					SISKO
			It's not my decision. It's up to
			the magistrate.

					ODO
			But you'd just as soon be rid of
			him. You didn't want him on the
			station in the first place. I
			practically had to beg you to let
			him out of that holding cell.

					SISKO
				(sharp)
			That's enough, Constable.

	Odo stiffens, holds his tongue.

					SISKO
			Now. General Martok has
			expressed concerns about our
			security arrangements.

					ODO
			Meaning?

					SISKO
			He doesn't feel it's appropriate
			that you be in charge of the
			prisoner.

	Odo bristles at hearing this.

					ODO
			May I ask why?

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       36.

41   CONTINUED:	(3)

	They both know why, because Odo's a changeling. But
	the official legal reason is this:

					SISKO
			Because you're a witness to the
			alleged crime.

					ODO
				(sardonic)
			That's a relief. For a moment I
			thought you were going to say
			it's because I'm a changeling.

	And with that, he turns and EXITS. Off Sisko and
	Worf as they watch him go...

41A  INT. PROMENADE/SECURITY OFFICE

	Odo is heading for his office when Quark calls out
	to him.

					QUARK
			Odo.
				(approaching)
			I heard about your friend. Rumor
			has it the Klingons want to put
			him on trial.

					ODO
				(heading inside)
			They're the ones who should be on
			trial. If they'd attacked anyone
			other than a changeling, they
			would be.

	Odo is expecting Quark to disagree with him, but
	instead --

					QUARK
			You're probably right.

	Odo looks at him with surprise.

					QUARK
			That fog episode certainly didn't
			help matters.

					ODO
			He was only doing what comes
			naturally to us.

					QUARK
			You've never pulled a stunt like
			that.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR      36A.

41A  CONTINUED:
					QUARK (Cont'd)
			You're smart enough to know
			people don't want to be reminded
			that you're different.
				(with a shiver)
			Who wants to see someone turn
			into goo? I hope you don't do
			that around Kira.

					ODO
			Why shouldn't I?

					QUARK
			If she's anything like me. She'd
			rather you didn't. We humanoids
			are the product of millions of
			years of evolution. Our
			ancestors learned the hard way
			that what you don't know might
			kill you. They wouldn't have
			survived if they hadn't jumped
			back when they encountered a
			snake coiled in the muck. And
			now millions of years later, that
			instinct is still there.

	Quark has an agenda here -- he's worried for Odo,
	but he's not about to come out and say so.

					QUARK
			It's genetic. Our tolerance for
			other lifeforms doesn't extend
			beyond the two arm, two leg
			variety. I hate to break it to
			you, but when you're in your
			natural state, you're more than
			our poor old genes can handle.

					ODO
				(dismissive)
			What are you saying, Quark? That
			the Klingons couldn't help what
			they did because of their genes?

					QUARK
			I'm not trying to excuse what
			they did. I'm only telling you
			why it happened.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR      36B.

41A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK (Cont'd)
				(concerned for his
				friend)
			Watch your step, Odo. We're at
			war with your people. This is no
			time for a changeling pride
			demonstration on the Promenade.

	And with that, Quark turns and EXITS. Off Odo's
	face as he watches him go...

42   INT. HOLDING CELLS

	A BAJORAN DEPUTY mans the security console. Odo
	ENTERS and approaches him, chafing at having to ask
	one of his own people for permission to see a
	prisoner.

					DEPUTY
			Constable.

					ODO
			I'd like to have a few minutes
			alone with the prisoner.

	The Deputy is loyal to his commanding officer, and
	embarrassed about having to do this.

					DEPUTY
			Sorry, sir. I have my orders.

	Odo nods, moves to the Holding Cell.

43   THE CHANGELING

	is sitting on the back bench. He looks up at him as
	he approaches, regards him with a resigned air.

					ODO
			I don't know what to say...

					CHANGELING
			You could say that you were
			wrong. That the people here are
			no different from any other
			humanoids.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       37.

43   CONTINUED:

	Odo doesn't have the heart to defend them anymore.

					ODO
			Hopefully this will all get
			straightened out at your hearing.

					CHANGELING
				(dry)
			I'm sure it will be fair and
			impartial.

					ODO
			Just tell them exactly what
			happened.

					CHANGELING
			My word against a humanoid's?
			Who do you think this magistrate
			is going to believe?

	Considering what happened, Odo's afraid the answer
	is all too clear.

					ODO
			I shouldn't have convinced you to
			stay here. If I'd let you go,
			none of this would've happened.

					CHANGELING
			My only consolation is that this
			may finally make you understand
			you don't belong here. You saw
			the hatred in that Klingon's
			eyes. Maybe now you'll recognize
			it when you see it hiding in the
			faces of your so-called friends.

	He moves close to the plain of the forcefield,
	trying to drive home his point.

					CHANGELING
			They tolerate you because you
			emulate them. What higher
			flattery is there? "I, who can
			be anything, choose to be like
			you."
				(beat)
			But even when you make yourself
			in their image, they know that
			you aren't truly one of them.
			What you appear to be doesn't
			reflect what you really are.
			It's only a mask.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       38.

43   CONTINUED:	(2)

					CHANGELING (Cont'd)
			What lies underneath is alien to
			them. So they fear it... and
			their fear can turn to hate in
			the blink of an eye...

	And off Odo's face as he ponders his words...

44   INT. ODO'S QUARTERS

	Kira is trying to calm an agitated Odo.

					ODO
			They're going to extradite him.

					KIRA
			You don't know that.

					ODO
			Yes, I do. And no one's going to
			do anything to stop it.

					KIRA
			There's not much anyone can do.

					ODO
			If he weren't a changeling, the
			captain would find a way to
			intervene.

					KIRA
			That's not fair.

					ODO
			Isn't it?

					KIRA
			You're starting to sound like
			Laas.

					ODO
			Maybe that's because I'm starting
			to see things more clearly now.

					KIRA
			What does that mean?

					ODO
				(taking her by the
				shoulders)
			Look at me, Nerys. What do you
			see?

	Kira's not sure what he's getting at.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       39.

44   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			I see you.

					ODO
			No. This is just a form I've
			borrowed. I could just as easily
			be someone else or something
			else.

					KIRA
			I know that. But...
				(taking his
				shoulders)
			... this is what you've chosen to
			be. A man whose good and
			honorable. And who I fell in
			love with.
				(pained)
			Are you telling me that man never
			really existed?

					ODO
				(anguished)
			I don't know...

	He turns away, trying to sort out what he's feeling.

					ODO
			I care about you more than anyone
			I've ever known... these last few
			months have been the happiest of
			my life.
				(a difficult
				admission)
			But even so, a part of me wishes
			that Laas and I were out there
			right now -- searching for the
			others, existing as changelings.
			Because that's what I am. Not a
			humanoid, a changeling.

	He turns away from her, not knowing how to deal with
	the turmoil inside him. After a long moment...

					KIRA
				(softly)
			You're right. Maybe you should
			be out there...

	And with that, she turns and EXITS.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       40.

	Off Odo as he gazes out at the stars...

46   INT. HOLDING CELLS (OPTICAL)

	Kira ENTERS and approaches the Guard at his console.

					DEPUTY
			Can I help you, colonel?

					KIRA
			I need to talk to the prisoner.
				(beat)
			Alone.

					DEPUTY
			Aye, sir.

	He heads for the door and EXITS. Kira moves to the
	Holding Cell, looks in on the Changeling.

	They regard each other for a long beat, then Kira
	reaches and works the control PANEL on the wall and
	the forcefield FRITZES OFF. He looks at her with
	surprise.

					KIRA
			Go to the third planet in the
			Koralis System. There's an
			orbital tether running down to an
			abandoned mining complex. I'll
			tell Odo to meet you there.

	He stares at her suspiciously.

					CHANGELING
			Is this some kind of trick?

	Kira shakes her head in disbelief.

					KIRA
			Do you want to get out of here or
			not?

	He decides she's telling the truth, steps toward the
	entrance to the holding cell.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FOUR       41.

46   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(pointing it out)
			That vent. It'll lead you
			through some conduits to an
			airlock.

	Before going, he studies her face for a beat, trying
	to make sense of her unexpected gesture.

					CHANGELING
			Why?

	A beat.

					KIRA
			Because I love him.

	He stares at her as if she's belying everything he's
	ever thought about humanoids. And off the moment
	between them we...

									FADE OUT.

47   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Sisko, Odo, and Worf are reacting to Kira's news.

					SISKO
			Escaped? How did he get through
			the containment field?

					KIRA
			I can't explain it, all I can
			tell you is what I saw. He
			turned himself into some kind
			of... plasma energy and forced
			his way through.
				("kicking herself")
			Before I could stop him, he
			disappeared into an air vent.

	Odo has to fight to keep from showing that he's
	privately pleased about the changeling's escape.

					WORF
			According to the operations log,
			one of the airlocks was activated
			shortly after that.

					SISKO
			If he left the station, why
			didn't our sensors detect him?

					WORF
			A Corvallen Freighter was leaving
			at about the same time. He must
			have shadowed it to keep from
			being spotted.

					KIRA
			He could be anywhere by now.

	Sisko takes this in with a grim nod.

					SISKO
			General Martok's not going to be
			happy about this...

					WORF
			By fleeing, the changeling has
			demonstrated his guilt.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FIVE       43.

47   CONTINUED:

					ODO
				(sardonic)
			Either that, or his lack of faith
			in our justice system.

	Worf stiffens, but ignores Odo's remark --

					WORF
			He must be apprehended and
			brought to trial.

					SISKO
				(to Worf)
			Have all available runabouts
			begin a sector-wide search.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

					ODO
				(under his breath)
			Good luck...

	Sisko shoots Odo a pointed look.

					SISKO
			It may be a long shot, but I'm
			sure you agree that we should do
			everything we can to find him.

					ODO
			Of course.

					SISKO
			Dismissed.

	Off Sisko as he watches the others file out...

48   INT. OPS

	Odo and Kira are stepping into the turbolift as Worf
	returns to his console.

49   INT. TURBOLIFT

					ODO
			Level Nine.

	As the Turbolift starts to descend, Kira turns to
	study Odo's face.

49   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			You didn't hide it very well.
				(off his look)
			That you're glad he got away.

	Odo feels he can be honest with her now that they're
	alone. He allows himself a small smile, almost
	proud of what the changeling did.

					ODO
			I should've known he'd be able to
			escape. What's a forcefield to a
			changeling with his abilities?

	Kira takes a beat, decides it's time to tell him the
	truth.

					KIRA
			You said you wish you were out
			there with him. It's not too
			late.

        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chimera" - REV. 12/16/98 - ACT FIVE       45.

49   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			I don't understand...

					KIRA
			He's waiting for you. At an
			abandoned mine on Koralis Three.

	Odo stares at her, realizing there's only one way
	she could know this.

					ODO
			You helped him escape...

	Kira doesn't deny it. Odo stares at her, trying to
	understand what she did.

					KIRA
			I don't want you to stay here out
			of some sense of obligation.
				(beat)
			Good luck. I hope you find what
			you're looking for.

	The lift slows to a STOP, and with a last look Odo's

					ODO
			Laas... ?

	The Changeling steps out from the shadows, breaks

	The Changeling sees something in Odo's face.

					CHANGELING
			What's wrong?

					ODO
			I'm not going with you.

					CHANGELING
				(anger flaring)
			Then why are you here?

					ODO
			I came to say good-bye.

					CHANGELING
			Don't be a fool. What are you
			holding on to? Kira? Even she
			knows this is what's best for
			you. Why else would she have
			helped me escape?

					ODO
			You really don't know, do you?
			You don't have any idea of what
			it means to love someone enough
			to let them go.

					CHANGELING
			She let you go so you could find
			out where you belong.

					ODO
			I know where I belong.
				(beat)
			Humanoids aren't the petty,

					ODO
			I'm sorry you don't understand.
			You've done many things, been
			many things -- but you've never
			known love.

					CHANGELING
			Compared to the Link, it's a pale
			shadow -- a feeble attempt to
			compensate for the isolation 
			mono-forms feel because they're
			trapped inside themselves.

					ODO
			Maybe the fact that it's not easy
			is what makes it worthwhile.

					CHANGELING
			Odo, the Founders are dying.
			This could be your last chance to
			exist as you were meant to.
			Don't throw it away.

	But Odo's made his decision.

					ODO
			You'd better go. They're looking
			for you.

	The Changeling searches Odo's face, sees that
	there's nothing more he can say.

					ODO
			Good luck...

	Odo extends his hand to him, offering one final
	Link. But the Changeling will have none of it.

					CHANGELING
			And to you, Odo. You'll need it

	Kira is standing before the Bajoran Altar in her

	crying -- the resolve with which she said good-bye to
	Odo gave way to tears in the privacy of her
	quarters.

					KIRA
			Watch over him... help him find

	A moment, then the door CHIMES.

					KIRA
			Yes.

	The door OPENS, revealing Odo. Their eyes lock

					KIRA
			I didn't think I'd see you
			again...

					ODO
			I couldn't go...

	A long beat, then they move into each other's arms,
	hold each other close...

					KIRA
				(softly)
			Odo, if I've ever made you feel
			that you can't be yourself when
			you're with me, I'm sorry. I
			want to know you -- the way you
			really are.

	A moment as they look into each other's eyes. Odo
	looks at her questioningly, and she nods as if to
	say go ahead. A beat, then...

	INTERACTIVE LIGHT plays on her face.

56   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	revealing that Odo has become a gossamer cloud of
	plasma-like ENERGY, an aurora borealis of golden
	color and light. She watches in wonder, then the

	She reacts to the sensation... her eyes close, and
	we get the sense that she and Odo are communing on a

	in hue and tone as if in response. Off this image,
