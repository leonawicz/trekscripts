	FADE IN:

1    INT. QUARK'S

	SISKO and O'BRIEN are in the middle of a dart game.  Sisko 
	concentrates... takes careful aim and then throws a dart.  
	Sisko smiles after seeing the result.

					SISKO
			Got you this time, Chief.

	Sisko steps aside and O'Brien steps up to the foul line... 
	he considers the board for a moment... and then makes a quick 
	throw based more on instinct than on careful aim.

2    ANGLE ON BOARD

	The dart goes right in the bullseye.

3    RESUME SISKO & O'BRIEN

	As they react.

					O'BRIEN
			Sorry, Commander.

					SISKO
			Don't apologize, that just makes it 
			worse.

					O'BRIEN
			I guess I'm in the zone today.

					SISKO
			The zone?

	They start taking the darts out of the board.

					O'BRIEN
			That feeling that I can't lose... 
			that I can put the dart exactly where 
			I want it.  You know the feeling.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - TEASER            2.

3    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Not today.

	They step back to the foul line and O'Brien throws another 
	dart -- right in the bullseye again.  Sisko can't believe 
	it, but then they're interrupted.

					DAX'S COM VOICE
			Dax to Sisko.

					SISKO
				(to com)
			Go ahead.

					DAX'S COM VOICE
			Benjamin, there's a priority message 
			for you from the Bajoran Provisional 
			Government.

					SISKO
			On my way.
				(to O'Brien)
			Fortunately, duty calls.  You'll 
			have to find another victim.

	O'Brien smiles and Sisko heads for the door.  As he reaches 
	the door to the Promenade, he passes BASHIR, who is just 
	ENTERING.

					SISKO
			Doctor.

					BASHIR
			Commander.  Is the chief here?

					SISKO
			He's back there... in the zone.

	Sisko EXITS.

4    INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	KIRA is dressed in casual clothes and is softly praying before 
	the Bajoran shrine in her quarters.  There is a large and 
	ornate OIL LAMP on the shrine, which is LIT.

					KIRA
				(quiet)
			... raka-ja ut shala morala... ema bo 
			roo kana... uranak...

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - TEASER            3.

4    CONTINUED:

					KIRA (Cont'd)
			... ralanon Bareil... propeh va nara 
			ehsuk shala-kan vunek ... (do not 
			let him walk alone... guide him on 
			his journey... protect... the one 
			named Bareil... take him into the 
			gates of heaven... )

	The door CHIMES.

					KIRA
			Enter.

	Sisko ENTERS and sees that Kira was in prayer.

					SISKO
			I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to 
			interrupt.

					KIRA
			It's all right.

	There's a quiet beat and Sisko can't help glancing at the 
	prayer lamp in curiosity.  Kira follows his gaze.

					KIRA
			It's called a duranja -- a lamp for 
			the dead.  I've been... praying for 
			Bareil.

	Sisko nods in understanding.

					KIRA
			What can I do for you?

					SISKO
			This may come as something of a shock 
			and I wanted you to hear it from me.
				(beat)
			The First Minister of the Provisional 
			Government has died.

					KIRA
			Kalem Apren?  How?

					SISKO
			Heart failure... he died in his sleep.

	Kira looks sad but not devastated.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - TEASER            4.

4    CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA
			I only met him once, but he seemed 
			like a good man.
				(beat)
			How soon will they appoint someone 
			to replace him?

	Sisko takes a long beat... knows this is not going to sit 
	well.

					SISKO
			They've already appointed someone.
				(beat)
			The new head of the Provisional 
			Government... is Kai Winn.

	Off Kira's stunned reaction...

									FADE OUT.

	Establishing the station.

6    INT. WARDROOM

	Kira and ODO are going over some reports on PADDS.  Kira 
	seems preoccupied.

					ODO
			... so as a result, I've transferred 
			Ensign Palmers back to the night 
			watch and reassigned Crewman Donark 
			to the Defiant as a member of the 
			security detachment.

	Kira nods with little interest.  Odo notices, but tries to 
	continue.

					ODO
				(continuing)
			Starfleet is sending a series of 
			upgrades for our tactical computer 
			modules next week.  I've drawn up a 
			plan to phase in the upgrades over 
			the course of three days.

	He hands Kira a PADD and she eyes it with little interest.  
	Odo studies her for a moment.

					ODO
			Major.
				(Kira looks up)
			Is something wrong?

					KIRA
			No.
				(beat)
			Yes.

	She gets up and moves around, struggling to put her feelings 
	and fears into words.

					KIRA
			It's this... whole thing with Kai 
			Winn.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE           6.

6    CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			I was just getting used to thinking 
			of her as the spiritual leader of 
			Bajor.  But now she's running the 
			entire government, Odo.

					ODO
			Not an ideal situation.

					KIRA
			I'm beginning to think that you and 
			I are the only ones who feel that 
			way.  No one's even going to oppose 
			her in next month's elections.  She's 
			going to be elected First Minister 
			for the next six years and no one 
			seems to care.

					ODO
			You and I have a different perspective 
			than most Bajorans, Major.  There's 
			a... personal element to our feelings 
			about her.
				(beat)
			I know you still blame Winn for 
			Bareil's death.

					KIRA
			That's part of it.  But this is about 
			the future of Bajor.  I can't shake 
			the feeling that giving Winn control 
			of the government is a mistake... 
			She has to be stopped...

					ODO
			Stopped from doing what?

					KIRA
			I don't know.  Maybe I'm afraid that 
			once she's in power... she's never 
			going to let go.

					ODO
			Unfortunately, that suspicion is not 
			shared by the people of Bajor.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE         7-8.

6    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO (Cont'd)
			They still admire her as... the woman 
			who made peace with Cardassia.

					KIRA
			Bareil made peace with Cardassia.

					ODO
			I know that, Major.  But to the rest 
			of Bajor, Winn is the real hero... 
			in their eyes, it took courage for 
			her to conclude a treaty with a race 
			that she herself had so bitterly 
			condemned and fought against.

					KIRA
			I don't care about her... popular 
			image, she's no hero.  She only cares 
			about one thing... her own power.  
			Why can't people see that?

	Kira takes a moment and looks out at the stars as a deep 
	depression begins to overwhelm her.

					KIRA
			We spent all those years fighting 
			against the Cardassians... all that 
			time spent hoping and praying for a 
			Bajor that was free... now, after 
			we've won, how can people hand their 
			freedom over to someone like Winn?

					ODO
			It has been my observation that one 
			of the prices of giving people freedom 
			of choice... is that sometimes they 
			make the wrong choice.

	Off Kira's face as she considers that disturbing thought.

7    INT. QUARK'S

	A small CROWD has gathered around to watch as O'Brien and 
	DAX finish the last couple of throws in a dart match.  QUARK 
	is standing nearby, watching with intense interest.  Dax 
	takes careful aim... and then throws.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE          8A.

7    CONTINUED:

	The Crowd reacts with a little excitement -- it's a tight 
	game.  Dax steps back and picks up her drink.  O'Brien steps 
	up to the line and quickly throws his last dart --  
	bullseye.  The crowd goes wild -- some cheering, some 
	disappointed, but everyone excited about the game.  Quark 
	steps into the middle of things.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE           9.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX
			I think I'll stick to Tongo from 
			now on.

					O'BRIEN
			Sorry, Lieutenant.

					QUARK
			Thank you, thank you all for your 
			gaming business.  The House will 
			start taking bets on the next 
			challenger at ten to one.  That's 
			ten to one, without even knowing who 
			the next challenger will be.

					O'BRIEN
			Quark, I have to go.

					QUARK
			No problem.
				(to crowd)
			Ladies and gentlemen, Chief of 
			Operations Miles Edward O'Brien now 
			has to leave to resume his duties 
			aboard the station.

	Quark begins applauding and the crowd joins in.

					QUARK
			Now, everyone, give him room... make 
			way, make way...

	Quark carefully shepherds O'Brien through the bar and out 
	the front door.

8    INT. PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS

	As Quark and O'Brien ENTER from Quark's.  Quark is treating 
	O'Brien like a very valuable commodity -- which he is at the 
	moment.

					QUARK
			I trust that we'll be seeing you 
			again tomorrow, for your... forty-
			seventh straight victory, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			I don't know... I was actually 
			thinking about getting some time in 
			the holosuites tomorrow.

	Quark suddenly looks horrified.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE          10.

8    CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			The holosuites?  You weren't thinking 
			of... going kayaking by any chance?

					O'BRIEN
			As a matter of fact...

					QUARK
				(quickly)
			Oh... didn't I tell you?  I misplaced 
			the kayaking program -- haven't seen 
			it in days.

	O'Brien stops and gives him a "who are you kidding?" look.  
	Quark instantly changes tacks and speaks with the passion 
	and conviction of a minister addressing his flock.

					QUARK
				(continuing)
			All right, look -- you're on a streak -- 
			an epic streak.  If you go kayaking 
			tomorrow... and something happens... 
			and you damage that... golden 
			shoulder... this streak will be over.  
			And you'll never know just how far 
			it might have taken you.
				(beat)
			Could you really live with that?

	O'Brien looks at him for a long moment... seems to give this 
	real thought.

					O'BRIEN
			You're offering ten to one tomorrow 
			to anyone betting against me?

					QUARK
			That's right.

					O'BRIEN
			I'd make it fifteen.

	O'Brien turns and walks away.  Quark can't believe it... he 
	looks as happy as we've ever seen him as he suddenly sees 
	visions of latinum dancing before him.

10   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	Kira is again in front of the shrine, the lamp is lit and 
	she's saying prayers.

					KIRA
			... bo roo kana... uranak... ralanon 
			Bareil... propeh va nara ehsuk shala-
			kan ...

	The door CHIMES.  Kira lets out a deep sigh... tries not to 
	sound too irritated.

					KIRA
			Yes?

	The door OPENS revealing KAI WINN standing in the doorway.  
	Kira is too stunned to say anything right away.

					WINN
			Hello, child.

					KIRA
			Eminence...

	There's a long beat.

					WINN
			May I come in?

					KIRA
				(getting it together)
			Of course.

	Winn ENTERS and looks around the room for a moment.

					WINN
			I hope you'll forgive the intrusion 
			child, I know the hour is late...

					KIRA
			Does Commander Sisko know that you're 
			aboard the station?

					WINN
			I'm not here to see the Emissary.  
			I'm here to see you.

					KIRA
			Me?

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE          12.

10   CONTINUED:

					WINN
			Yes, Child.

	Winn notices the lit prayer lamp.

					WINN
				(re: lamp)
			Have you suffered a recent loss?  Or 
			are you still mourning the death of 
			Minister Kalem?

					KIRA
			It's for Vedek Bareil, actually.

					WINN
			It's been three months since Bareil 
			left us to walk with the Prophets... 
			you must have cared for him deeply.

					KIRA
			I... loved him.

					WINN
			As did I.

					KIRA
				(icy)
			Is that why you never mention Bareil's 
			name when you talk about your peace 
			treaty with Cardassia?  As I recall, 
			he was the one who negotiated it.

					WINN
			Bareil saw himself as simply carrying 
			out the will of the Prophets.  To 
			him, achieving peace with Cardassia 
			was its own reward.  He never wanted 
			fame or glory for what he did.
				(beat)
			As someone who loved him, I'm 
			surprised you didn't know that.

	Kira's emotions threaten to bubble to the surface, but Winn 
	has boxed her into a tight corner and Kira realizes the 
	futility of trying to fight her way out.  She turns away 
	from Winn and tries to steady herself.

					KIRA
			What is it you want, Eminence?

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE          13.

10   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WINN
			Are you familiar with Rakantha 
			Province?

	Kira's caught offstride by the abrupt change of subject.

					KIRA
			It's... a farming community.

					WINN
			And it used to be one of the most 
			productive agricultural regions on 
			Bajor.  But as you know, the 
			Cardassians poisoned much of our 
			farmlands before they left, and 
			Rakantha has been mostly barren 
			wasteland ever since.
				(beat)
			After years of research, the 
			agricultural ministry has finally 
			developed reclamators which can 
			detoxify the soil and make it fertile 
			again.

					KIRA
			This is all very interesting, but 
			what does this have to do with me?

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT ONE          14.

10   CONTINUED:	(3)

					WINN
			Patience, Child.
				(beat)
			In six months, it will be the planting 
			season in Rakantha.  By this time 
			next year, we can be producing boton, 
			moreka, salam grass -- all of them 
			valuable commodities for export.  If 
			we can attract interstellar commerce 
			to Bajor, it will only enhance our 
			application for membership in the 
			Federation.

					KIRA
				(nods)
			I understand...

					WINN
			Unfortunately, a group of farmers 
			who were allowed to use the 
			reclamators in another province are 
			now refusing to return them.
				(beat)
			That's why I've come to you, Kira.  
			You see, the farmers who've seized 
			the equipment are in Dahkur Province -- 
			your home.  And they're led by a man 
			you're acquainted with... his name 
			is Shakaar.

					KIRA
				(surprised)

			If I'm not mistaken, he was the leader

	Kira looks at Winn like she's out of her mind.

					KIRA
			You're asking me to go  against a

			hundred occasions... for you?

	Winn refuses to rise to the bait.  She's completely 
	reasonable.

					WINN
			Not for me, child.  For Bajor.
				(beat)
			I know that we've had our differences 
			in the past... but I'm asking you to 
			put those feelings aside and think 
			about what is best for our people.

	Kira has trouble fighting against that argument and Winn 
	knows it.  Winn presses her.

					WINN
				(continuing)
			We are on the verge of a new era... 
			the Occupation is over, we've achieved 
			peace with Cardassia, Federation 
			membership is only a few years away... 
			this is an exciting time to be a 
			Bajoran.  But our future depends on 
			each of us acting for the common 
			good of all Bajor.
				(beat)
			Shakaar has lost sight of that.  By 
			stealing the reclamators, he's acting 
			in his own self-interest at the 
			expense of the rest of our people.

					KIRA
			I know Shakaar... and he's one of 
			the most... selfless people I ever 
			met.  He must have a good reason for 
			what he's done.

					WINN
			Perhaps.  Perhaps he is only... 
			misguided.  That's why I've come to 
			you, Kira.  You know him... you can 
			talk to him.  I don't want this to 
			become a... scandal.  I want this to 
			be settled quietly, peacefully.
				(beat)
			Surely we can both agree that that's 
			a worthy goal...

	Kira is caught here... she's can't really disagree with 
	anything Winn is saying.

					KIRA
			I can... talk to him.  But I can't 
			guarantee he'll listen to me.

	Winn glances over at the lamp.

					WINN
			Vedek Bareil used to tell me that 
			you can be quite persuasive when you 
			put your mind to it, child.
				(beat)
			I hope that he wasn't mistaken.  
			Walk with the Prophets.

	Winn EXITS, leaving Kira with a lot to think about...

	FADE IN:

11   EXT. SHAKAAR'S FARM - DAY (OPTICAL)

	Kira MATERIALIZES on a vast desolate plain.  Although there 
	are no crops visible, the presence of fences, and abandoned 
	equipment identify this as farmland.  Kira bends down and 
	picks up a handful of the dry soil... she rubs it between 
	her fingers... sniffs it... crumbles it in her hands.  The 
	soil is sandy... it's doubtful that anything will grow here.  
	Kira looks around and sees a lone BAJORAN FARMHOUSE standing 
	nearby.  The house has seen better days and it looks shabby.

	Kira takes a deep breath and then walks up onto the front 
	porch.  She presses a door panel... no response.  After a 
	beat, she pounds on the door... but still nothing.  She moves 
	over to a window and tries to peer through it when she is 
	suddenly GRABBED from behind and whirled around.  Kira's 
	combat instincts flare and she cocks back an arm for a killing 
	blow, but then freezes as she sees that the man holding her 
	is SHAKAAR.  Shakaar is a handsome, solidly built man in his 
	late thirties to early forties.  He has a piercing, 
	intelligent gaze and always seems to be thinking.  His face 
	has a prematurely aged look to it -- the look of a man who's 
	been through a lot at an early age.  His hair is long and 
	falls to his shoulders.

					KIRA
			Shakaar.

	They both stare at each other for a long moment... neither 
	one sure what to feel or say.

					SHAKAAR
			You cut your hair.

					KIRA
			You let yours grow.

					SHAKAAR
			I liked you better the old way.

					KIRA
			I was just thinking the same thing... 
			about you.

	A quick beat and then Shakaar smiles and takes her in his 
	arms and gives her a warm hug.  Kira returns it.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          17.

11   CONTINUED:

					SHAKAAR
			It's good to see you, Nerys.

					KIRA
			It's good to see you too.

	Shakaar lets her go and looks at her with obvious affection 
	and warmth.

					SHAKAAR
			Come in, come in...

	They both EXIT to...

12   INT. SHAKAAR'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

	The interior of the house is in only slightly better shape 
	than the exterior.  The furnishings all look second rate and 
	there is a definite feeling that what little decoration there 
	is was thrown together from what was available rather than 
	through any eye for design.  Shakaar and Kira ENTER.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          18.

12   CONTINUED:

					SHAKAAR
			So.  Major Kira Nerys.  Deep Space 
			Nine's first officer.  You've made 
			quite a name for yourself.

					KIRA
			Not really.

					SHAKAAR
			You've accomplished a great deal.  
			You should be proud.

	Kira looks a little embarrassed, but Shakaar is one of the 
	few people whose praise actually means something to her and 
	it shows.

					SHAKAAR
				(continuing)
			Furel and Lupaza are so proud of you 
			they actually stand a little taller 
			when your name comes up.

	Kira's head snaps up at the names.

					KIRA
			Furel and Lupaza?  You still see 
			them?

					SHAKAAR
			Of course.  They both have farms 
			less than ten kilometers from here.

					KIRA
			Those two are farmers?  You, yes -- 
			it was all you talked about -- but 
			Lupaza?  How'd that happen?

					SHAKAAR
			You can ask her yourself.  They'll 
			be here in a couple of hours.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          19.

12   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SHAKAAR (Cont'd)
				(smiles)
			I can't wait to see their faces when 
			they come through that door and find 
			you standing here.

	Shakaar chuckles to himself and begins moving to the tiny 
	kitchen area of the house.  Kira looks a little troubled and 
	she moves after him.

					KIRA
			Shakaar... before they get here, we 
			should talk.  I'm... here on business.

					SHAKAAR
				(quiet)
			Nerys... I know why you're here.  
			And I need time to think about it.  
			All right?

	Kira looks at him and smiles after a long beat.

					KIRA
			All right.

	Shakaar smiles back and then moves to a different part of 
	the house.

									CUT TO:

13   EXT. SHAKAAR'S FARM - NIGHT

	Darkness has fallen.  The lights in the house are ON and we 
	can hear voices and laughter coming from inside the house.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          20.

14   INT. SHAKAAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kira, Shakaar, FUREL, and LUPAZA are sitting in the living 
	area with the remains of food and drink scattered around.  
	Furel is older than the others, in his late fifties with a 
	cautious, thoughtful attitude.  He's also missing his left 
	ARM.  Lupaza is a woman in her early forties and is more 
	highly strung.

	The mood is warm and convivial, but underlying everything is 
	the fact that these people shared a grim and arduous 
	experience.  The fight against the Cardassians shaped and 
	molded each of them and that shared background serves to 
	temper their gaiety even in the best of times.

					LUPAZA
				(to Furel)
			You never would've found your way 
			out of there if I hadn't left that 
			marker on the rock.

					FUREL
			I have a fine sense of direction.  I 
			knew exactly where I was the whole 
			night.

					KIRA
			I found your tracks the next day.  
			You were walking in circles.

					FUREL
				(with dignity)
			I was throwing the Cardassians off 
			my trail.

	This is met with outright laughter, but it's all in fun and 
	even Furel smiles, showing he has a sense of humor about 
	himself.  The laughter settles down after a moment and more 
	drinks are poured.  Lupaza suddenly remembers something.

					LUPAZA
			Nerys?  Guess who I saw last week?  
			Mobara.

					KIRA
			Really?

					LUPAZA
			He's in school now... studying 
			engineering.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          21.

14   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			That's perfect.  Now he can build 
			bridges and then blow them up.

	Furel holds out an empty glass.

					FUREL
			Again, please.

	Kira picks up the pitcher and starts to fill the glass.

					KIRA
			Furel... if you don't mind my 
			asking... why haven't you--

					FUREL
			Why haven't I had my arm replaced?  
			Well... I thought about it.  Even 
			saw a Federation doctor about it... 
			she said, "No problem, Furel.  You 
			can have a new arm in less than a 
			week... you'll have full range of 
			motion and it'll feel just like your 
			own."

					KIRA
			So why didn't you do it?

	Furel shrugs... to him losing the arm and his reasons for 
	doing so are a badge of honor.  He's proud of it.

					FUREL
			Before I went into that interrogation 
			center, I asked the Prophets to give 
			me the strength to get the rest of 
			you out of there.  And in return... 
			I said I'd give up my life.  As it 
			turned out, I not only rescued you 
			and Shakaar and Lupaza... it only 
			cost me an arm.
				(beat)
			I felt like the Prophets were 
			generous.  Somehow replacing the arm 
			seems... ungrateful.

	A quiet beat as they all reflect on this.  After a beat, 
	Lupaza breaks the moment.

					LUPAZA
				(dry)
			I think you're just afraid that with 
			two arms, you'd actually have to do 
			some real work for a change.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          22.

14   CONTINUED:	(2)

	The mood lightens a bit as the familiar jousting between 
	the two of them continues.

					FUREL
			I've done more work on my farm in 
			the last three months than you've 
			done in three years.  I've seen weeds 
			that look better than the crops you're 
			growing.

					LUPAZA
			You know good and well that my soil's 
			more toxic than any farm tract within 
			a hundred kilometers.
				(Furel rolls his eyes)
			It's true.  Once I get a chance to 
			use one of the reclamators things'll 
			change, I can promise you that.

	Kira shifts uneasily at the mention of this topic.  Shakaar 
	glances at her and then calmly puts it all on the table.

					SHAKAAR
				(quiet)
			You may not get that chance, Lupaza.
				(beat)
			Nerys was sent here by the Kai with 
			orders to convince us to return the 
			reclamators to the government.

	Kira looks at Furel and Lupaza, not sure what to expect from 
	them.  They both look at her pleasantly, not at all put off 
	by this news.

					FUREL
				(to Shakaar)
			And you said no...

					SHAKAAR
			I said I'd have to think about it.

					LUPAZA
			There's not much to think about 
			Shakaar... you know that.
				(pleasant, to Kira)
			Tell the Kai or the First Minister 
			or whatever she wants to be called 
			these days that the answer's no.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          23.

14   CONTINUED:	(3)

					LUPAZA (Cont'd)
			We need the reclamators and that's 
			the end of it.
				(beat)
			Now, who wants tuwaly pie?

	Lupaza gets up and moves to a sideboard where there's a pie.  
	She seems to have effectively ended the conversation about 
	the reclamators and moved on.

					FUREL
			I hope you didn't put too much rekja 
			in it this time.

					LUPAZA
			I'm not going to start taking cooking 
			lessons from a man who can't even 
			boil carnat legs without turning 
			them into glue...

					FUREL
			Now don't start that again... that 
			happened one time...

	During the above dialog, we PUSH IN on Kira's face and we 
	can see that Kira is still disturbed.  OFF Kira's expression 
	we...

								DISSOLVE TO:

15   EXT. SHAKAAR'S FARM - NIGHT

	Shakaar and Kira are standing on the front porch, looking 
	out over the landscape.  Furel and Lupaza have just left.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          24.

15   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			You know... this business with the 
			reclamators isn't going to just go 
			away, Shakaar.

					SHAKAAR
				(unruffled)
			Maybe not.

					KIRA
			Definitely not.
				(beat)
			I think you should reconsider.

	Shakaar turns and looks at her and while his expression is 
	still friendly, we can see the steely determination in his 
	face.  Kira pushes on.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			I know what you're trying to do 
			here... and I know how difficult 
			it's been.  But we need to think 
			about what's best for Bajor.

					SHAKAAR
			If you think giving the reclamators 
			back to the government is what's 
			best for Bajor, then you've been on 
			that space station for too long.
				(beat)
			We waited three years to get the 
			reclamators.  Two months ago, we 
			finally got them and we were told 
			that they were ours for at least a 
			year.  The Provisional Government 
			actually did something right for a 
			change.
				(beat)
			Then Minister Kalem died... and the 
			next thing we knew, we get an order 
			to return the reclamators immediately 
			to...
				(derisive)
			... the Rakantha farming project.

					KIRA
			The Rakantha project is important.  
			If they can get it underway, Bajor 
			could begin exporting goods again.  
			It'll start to change how the rest 
			of the galaxy looks at us.  They'll 
			stop seeing us as poor refugees and 
			start seeing us as equals.

15   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SHAKAAR
				(harsh)
			I don't give a damn about how the 
			rest of the galaxy looks at us.  
			We're trying to feed our own people 
			and you're talking about exports!

	There's a beat as Shakaar lets his temper subside for a 
	moment.

					SHAKAAR
				(continuing)
			Rakantha may be an important project, 
			Kira, but they have everything: 
			agrobiologists, chemists, and fifty 
			reclamators.  What do we have?  
			Nothing but toxic soil and obsolete 
			farming equipment.

	Kira thinks for a moment...

					KIRA
			There has to be a way to reach some 
			kind of compromise here...

					SHAKAAR
			How?

					KIRA
			I don't know... but maybe if you and 
			the Kai sat down together, you could 
			reach some kind of arrangement... 
			some way to share the equipment more 
			fairly.  If I could arrange a meeting 
			between you and her, would you be 
			willing to at least talk with her 
			about it?

					SHAKAAR
			I don't know if it'll accomplish 
			anything.

					KIRA
			It might not... but at least it's a 
			place to start.

	Shakaar takes a beat... then regards Kira with a softer 
	expression.  He moves closer to her and lowers his voice.

           DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT TWO          26.

15   CONTINUED:	(3)

					SHAKAAR
			All right.  For you... I'll meet 
			with her.


	He's about to go back inside, then he gives her a kiss on 
	the cheek and a warm hug.

					SHAKAAR
			It's good to have you home, Nerys.  
			You should come back more often.

					KIRA
			Maybe I will.

					SHAKAAR
			Good.  Because we've all missed you.
				(beat)
			Especially me.

	Shakaar smiles, then EXITS to the house, leaving Kira alone 
	on the porch.

16   EXT. BAJOR - STOCK MATTE SHOT (OPTICAL)

	Establishing the Bajoran capital city.

17   INT. FIRST MINISTER'S OFFICE

	The office of the head of the Bajoran secular government, a 
	relatively small room sparsely decorated.  Kai Winn's only 
	had it for three weeks and has only begun to introduce any 
	personal effects.

	An N.D. Bajoran Government official is awaiting instructions 
	from the Kai.

					WINN
			These are the codes you'll need to 
			access my personal files in the Vedek 
			Assembly Records.  Have them 
			transferred to this office as soon 
			as possible.

	During the above, Kira ENTERS.  The Bajoran official nods 
	his acknowledgement and EXITS.

					KIRA
			Making yourself at home, I see.

					WINN
			Providing the Bajoran people with 
			both spiritual and secular leadership 
			is a grave responsibility.  If I 
			must abandon my offices in the Vedek 
			Assembly to prove worthy of the task 
			the Prophets have set before me, 
			then so be it.

					KIRA
			I'm sure the Bajoran people will 
			appreciate your sacrifice.

	The Kai pretends to have missed the sarcasm in Kira's voice.

					WINN
			Am I to assume, my child, that you 
			have met with Shakaar?

					KIRA
			We've talked.

					KIRA
			He's not ready to return them... 
			yet.

					WINN
				(still calm)
			I see.  And when can we expect the 
			return of the equipment?

					KIRA
			As soon as the topsoil in Dahkur 
			Province has been restored and readied 
			for planting.  Another six months.

					WINN
			In six months, the planting season 
			in Rakantha will be over.

					KIRA
			I realize that... and I know how 
			important the Rakantha project is... 
			which is why I've arranged a meeting 
			between the two of you.

					WINN
			A meeting?

					KIRA
			Yes.  To work out a compromise.  If 
			you'll just hear him out and look at 
			the work they've been able to 
			accomplish in Dahkur in only two 
			months, you'll see why this is so 
			important to them.  There must be 
			some way to resolve this situation 
			so that both Rakantha and Dahkur can 
			benefit.

	Winn looks at Kira for a long moment... her face unreadable, 
	but clearly thinking about something.

					WINN
			Did you explain to Shakaar that you 
			were there on the direct authority 
			of the First Minister?

					KIRA
			Yes.  But it wouldn't have mattered 
			if I were there on behalf of the 
			Prophets themselves.

			He wasn't going to just give up the

					WINN
			A pity.  Shakaar sounds like a 
			prideful, arrogant man.  It also 
			seems like there's no reasoning with 
			him.

					KIRA
			Shakaar is not an unreasonable man.  
			He's desperate.  They all are -- you 
			should see what they're up against... 
			the condition of the land... the 
			harsh weather.  But if you would 
			just talk to him, I'm sure you'll be

	Winn thinks about this for a beat, and then seems to reach a 
	conclusion.

					WINN
			Well.  It would seem that I have 
			little choice.

					KIRA
			So I can tell him that you'll discuss 
			this with him?

					WINN
			Yes.  You can tell him that.  And 
			then you can return to Deep Space 
			Nine.

					KIRA
			I can still serve as an intermediary 
			between you and Shakaar...

					WINN
			That won't be necessary.  You've

	Close on O'Brien, who is half buried in an open panel, busy

					SYVAR (O.S.)
			Excuse me.

	O'Brien, startled by the voice, bangs his head on the

			My apologies.  I did not intend to

			It's all right.  I'm Chief Miles

					SYVAR
			I understand you are quite proficient

					O'BRIEN
			I'm afraid I don't know what you're

					SYVAR
			You are not aware of our upcoming

					SYVAR
			I see.  In that case, there will be 
			no dishonor when you decline the

					O'BRIEN
			I... didn't say I wanted to decline.

					SYVAR
			It would be most advisable for you 
			to do so.

					O'BRIEN
			Oh?  And why is that?

					SYVAR
			As a Vulcan, I am better suited to 
			this game than a human.  My hand-eye 
			coordination is superb, I am able to 
			mentally calculate the precise 
			trajectory necessary for each throw, 
			and my lack of emotional attachment 
			to the game makes me a superior dart

	Re-establishing.

22   INT. SHAKAAR'S HOUSE - DAY

	Shakaar and Kira are in mid-conversation.  Shakaar's attitude 
	toward Kira is one of a big brother talking to his younger 
	sister.  He listens to what she has to say, but to him, Kira 
	will always be one of his followers in the resistance cell.

					SHAKAAR
			Well, I'll be interested to hear 
			what she has to say, but she's not 
			getting those reclamators back until 
			we're finished with them.

					KIRA
			Shakaar... you have to be flexible.  
			I'm not sure this is a fight you can 
			win.

					SHAKAAR
				(smiles)
			That's what the Cardassians used to 
			say.

	Just then, someone KNOCKS on Shakaar's door.

					SHAKAAR
			Come in.

23   NEW ANGLE

	Two BAJORAN SECURITY OFFICERS (dressed in the same type of 
	uniform Odo wears), ENTER.

					SECURITY OFFICER #1
			Are you Shakaar?

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT THREE         33.

23   CONTINUED:

					SHAKAAR
			Yes.

					SECURITY OFFICER #1
			You're under arrest.

					KIRA
			What?  Who authorized this?

					SECURITY OFFICER #1
			Our orders came directly from the 
			office of the First Minister.

	Kira flushes with anger.

					KIRA
			She lied to me.

					SHAKAAR
			She's good at it, Nerys.  Don't feel 
			bad.

					SECURITY OFFICER #1
			If you'll come with us...

					SHAKAAR
			All right, but I want to make one 
			thing clear...

	Without warning, Shakaar lashes out and punches the first 
	Security Officer.  The second Security Officer tries to draw 
	his sidearm, but Kira instinctively hits him, knocking him 
	to the ground.  By the time she's retrieved the unconscious 
	officer's weapon, Shakaar has knocked his own opponent to 
	the ground and taken his weapon.

					SHAKAAR
				(to Kira)
			I'm glad to see living on that space 
			station hasn't slowed you down.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT THREE         34.

23   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA
			We'd better get out of here.

	Kira starts to head for the door, but Shakaar stops her.

					SHAKAAR
				(re: Security Officers)
			This can still be explained away.  
			It was a tense situation and you 
			acted on instinct.  They'll understand 
			that... but they won't understand 
			you coming with me.
				(beat)
			This isn't your fight, Nerys.  Go 
			home.

	Kira looks at him for a long moment.

					KIRA
			I am home, Shakaar.  And I've been 
			lied to by Kai Winn for the last 
			time.  She wants a fight... I'll 
			give her one.

	Shakaar looks at her... sees the determination in her 
	expression... then finally nods and heads out of the cave.  
	Kira waits a beat, then follows him.

									FADE OUT.

24   INT. CAVES

	A short time later.  Shakaar, and Furel are talking in hushed, 
	urgent tones while Kira breaks out weapons and equipment 
	from storage containers.  The equipment is old and obviously 
	well used.  There's a sense of urgency in the air.

					FUREL
			... the civil police have issued a 
			province-wide alert for you and Kira.  
			They've requested that the surrounding 
			towns send more men and equipment to 
			help in the search for the 
			"fugitives."

					SHAKAAR
			There's a familiar word.  I haven't 
			been called that in a while... I 
			kinda missed it.

	Furel grins tightly as Lupaza hurries in.

					LUPAZA
				(to Shakaar)
			The authorities have seized your 
			farm and they've brought in a scanning 
			team to hunt for the reclamators.

					SHAKAAR
			Let'em scan.  There's nothing there 
			for them to find.

					LUPAZA
			They've also detained some of the 
			other members of our resistance cell 
			for "questioning."

					KIRA
			Who?

					LUPAZA
			Mobara, Klin and Ornak were taken 
			away before I could warn them.  The 
			others are heading for the Kola 
			Mountain stronghold.  I said we'd 
			meet them there and go over our plan.

					FUREL
				(to Shakaar)
			What is our plan?

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FOUR          36.

24   CONTINUED:

	Shakaar glances over at Kira, who is listening, but clearly 
	deep in thought and trying to reach some kind of decision.

					SHAKAAR
			For now... the plan is to keep moving.  
			We'll let the civil police run 
			themselves ragged chasing us through 
			the mountains.

					FUREL
				(grins)
			Just like old times...

					SHAKAAR
			That's the general idea.  The 
			Cardassians spent ten years searching 
			for us in these mountains... the 
			civil police will probably give up 
			in ten days.

					KIRA
			I'm not so sure about that... some 
			of them used to be in the Resistance 
			too... they might not give up so 
			easily.

					SHAKAAR
			Maybe.  But I don't think they really 
			want to hunt down a group of fellow 
			Bajorans who are just trying to defend 
			their homes.
				(beat)
			We'll head for Kola Mountain, pick 
			up anyone who's there and then go 
			further up into the hill country.  
			Let's go.

	They all head out of the cave.

	Re-establishing.  The Garuda is still in port.

26   INT. QUARK'S

	A large crowd is watching silently as a dart comes streaking 
	across the screen and imbeds itself in the dart board.  It's 
	a great shot (triple twenty or something like that) and the 
	crowd gasps audibly in admiration.  The other dart in the 
	board is also in a great spot (either a double or triple).

	The camera pans over to where O'Brien stands at the throw 
	line, looking very confident and unable to ignore the crowd's 
	acclaim.

	Syvar can't help but stoically raise a single eyebrow in 
	Vulcan annoyance.

					BASHIR
			Yes!

					SYVAR
			A most auspicious shot.

					BASHIR
				(excited)
			You've got him, Chief.  One in the

			Don't worry "coach," I won't let you

			I see no need for delay.  Throw the 
			dart.

					O'BRIEN
			I'll throw it when I'm ready.

	Quark comes up from behind him with a tray of drinks.

					QUARK
			Did I miss anything?

					DAX
			Shhh.

					O'BRIEN
				(still eyeing Syvar)
			Is that my synthale?

					QUARK
			Extra-stout, just the way you like 
			it.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Syvar)
			Excuse me.

	Without looking, O'Brien reaches back with his right arm for 
	the beer, and there's a familiar "pop."

					O'BRIEN
				(hunching in pain)
			Ahhh.

	O'Brien grabs his right shoulder.

					QUARK
				(worried)
			What is it?

	Bashir makes a quick examination.

					BASHIR
			It's his shoulder.  It's popped out 
			of the socket.  Again.
				(to Waiter)
			Get me a medkit.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FOUR          39.

26   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
			What did I do?  I just handed him a 
			drink.

	Bashir is handed a medkit by the waiter and he pulls out a 
	tricorder.

					O'BRIEN
			Julian... just pop it back in... 
			I'll be fine.

	But Bashir has begun to frown at what he sees on the tricorder 
	and begins to scan O'Brien's shoulder.

					BASHIR
			I'm afraid it's not that simple this 
			time, Chief.  You have a rotator 
			cuff tear with severe degenerative 
			damage.  We'd better get you to the 
			Infirmary.

					SYVAR
			If he leaves the line, he has 
			forfeited the game.

					QUARK
				(panicked)
			Forfeit?

					BASHIR
			Look, this man needs surgery.

					O'BRIEN
			Surgery?

					BASHIR
			That's right, Chief.  I may have to 
			replace the entire humoral socket.
				(to the Vulcan)
			It's a simple procedure.  We can 
			postpone the conclusion of the match 
			until tomorrow... by then his shoulder 
			will be good as new.

					SYVAR
			I do not make the rules.  I merely 
			follow them.  In any case, the Garuda 
			is departing this evening.

	O'Brien makes an incautious move and nearly passes out from 
	the pain.

					O'BRIEN
				(agonized)
			I need... surgery.

	Bashir guides O'Brien toward the door and Syvar cocks an 
	eyebrow at Quark.

					SYVAR
			I believe the House was paying... 
			fifteen to one.

28   INT. FIRST MINISTER'S OFFICE

					(FORMERLY SCENE 35)
			Sisko is seated watching Kai Winn 
			pace around the room.  She's extremely 
			agitated.

					WINN
			Emissary, I am so glad you came to 
			consult with me.

					SISKO
			Frankly, I was surprised you wanted 
			my advice.

					WINN
			The advice of the Emissary is always 
			welcome.  But what I really need is 
			your help.

					SISKO
			What kind of help?

					WINN
			It's been two weeks since I was forced 
			to send the militia into Dahkur 
			Province.

					SISKO
			And?

					WINN
			And they have yet to catch sight of 
			Shakaar or any of his followers, let 
			alone take them into custody.

					SISKO
			I guess now you know how the 
			Cardassians must've felt.

	The Kai looks at Sisko to see if he is deliberately insulting 
	her, but Sisko's face remains neutral.

					WINN
			The point is, I can't let this go on 
			much longer.  It embarrasses me to 
			say this, but Shakaar's defiance 
			seems to be catching on in some of 
			the other Provinces.  I've had to 
			take certain... unfortunate actions 
			to maintain order.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FOUR         41A.

					SISKO
			You mean declaring martial law and

					WINN
			I wasn't aware that you kept such... 
			close watch on the Bajoran political 
			situation.

					SISKO
			I try to stay informed.
				(beat)
			From what I understand, Shakaar is 
			starting to gain support all over 
			Bajor.

					WINN
			Is that what Major Kira's been telling 
			you?

					SISKO
			I haven't spoken to the Major in 
			quite some time.

					WINN
			Emissary, I don't want this issue to 
			divide my people.

					SISKO
			Then I'd advise withdrawing your 
			troops from Dahkur.

					WINN
			I'm more than willing to do that.
				(a beat)
			On one condition.

					SISKO
			And what would that be?

					WINN
			I'd like you to provide a Federation 
			security force to take their place.

					SISKO
			You want me to bring in Shakaar for 
			you.

					WINN
			Such an act would do much to solidify 
			relations between the Federation and 
			Bajor.

28   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			I wasn't aware our relationship needed 
			solidifying.

					WINN
			Nevertheless, this is an opportunity 
			for the Federation to once again 
			show it's friendship to Bajor.

	Sisko thinks about if for a beat, then...

					SISKO
			I'm sorry, but I'm afraid Federation 
			law prevents me from interfering in 
			Bajoran internal affairs.

					WINN
				(doesn't like it)
			So you're refusing my request for 
			aid?

					SISKO
			I suppose I am.

					WINN
			If Bajor cannot depend on the 
			Federation, we'll withdraw our 
			application for membership.

					SISKO
			That would be an unfortunate 
			overreaction on your part.  And if I 
			may say so, your entire response to 
			this crisis has been an overreaction.  
			By using militia troops against your 
			own people, you're risking civil war 
			over a handful of soil reclamators.

					WINN
			I'm afraid you can't see what's really 
			going on here.  This is not about 
			soil reclamators.  This is about the 
			future of our society.  If someone 
			like Shakaar can defy the law and 
			escape punishment, then we risk 
			descending into anarchy and chaos.

29   EXT. HILLS - DAY

	Kira, Shakaar, Furel, Lupaza and ELEVEN N.D. BAJORAN CIVILIANS 
	are scrambling down a hillside at a breakneck pace.  They're 
	armed now with an assortment of Bajoran and Cardassian weapons 
	and they also have a motley batch of tricorders and other

					SHAKAAR
				(urgent)
			Move, move, move!

	They scramble down the hill, duck down into a dry river

	DEVICE and begins frantically working the controls.  Furel 
	holds a tricorder.

					FUREL
				(off tricorder)
			They're closing.  Seventy-five meters.

			Come on, Kira.

			I've almost got it...

	She keeps working... then Lupaza hisses a warning.

			They're on the ridge.

	Everyone hunkers down and looks back up the way they came.

30   ANGLE ON RIDGE

	At the top of the hill that Kira and the others just came 
	down, there is now an ARMED PATROL of NINETEEN N.D. BAJORAN 
	TROOPS.  The leader holds up a hand and they stop as he pulls 
	out a tricorder and starts scanning the area.

	as he watches the troops.  He slowly moves his weapon up to 
	the ready.

					SHAKAAR
				(low)
			Kira if you can't do it... tell me

	She finishes working on the device and hits a final control.  
	A light on the device begins FLASHING.

					KIRA
			I got it...

	She looks up at the troops.

	As the leader scans the area... he suddenly sees something 
	on the tricorder... motions for his men to follow... and 
	they head off in the wrong direction.

33   RESUME KIRA & SHAKAAR

	As they breathe a sigh of relief.  Everyone looks exhausted.

					SHAKAAR
			How long do we have?

					KIRA
			I've projected the false life signs 
			about seven hundred meters past that 
			ravine.  It'll probably take them... 
			an hour to cover that distance... 
			maybe another fifteen minutes to 
			realize what's happened.

	Furel tries to catch his breath... he rubs a leg in obvious 
	pain.

					FUREL
			Either I'm getting older... or these 
			mountains are getting higher.

					LUPAZA
			The next time I start getting 
			nostalgic for the old days... shoot 
			me.

					FUREL
			If you insist.

	Shakaar carefully peers at the troops heading off in the 
	wrong direction.  Kira sets the flashing device on the ground.

					SHAKAAR
				(re: troops)
			They're good.

					KIRA
			Half of them are from Dahkur 
			Province... they know the terrain 
			almost as well as we do.

					SHAKAAR
			I think you're right... we need to 
			leave Dahkur... they'll box us in if

	Shakaar is about to agree when Furel steps forward.

					FUREL
			Yes, we do.  We can turn and fight.

					LUPAZA
			He's right, Shakaar.  It's just like 
			in the old days... every once in a 
			while the Cardassians would get too 
			close... and we'd turn around and 
			give them a bloody nose.

					SHAKAAR
				(quiet)
			Sometimes it was our nose that got

					FUREL
			We've always been willing to take

			I'll follow whatever order you give... 
			but I'm tired of running.

	Shakaar looks around and sees that they all agree with Furel.

					SHAKAAR
			Kira?

	Kira thinks for a long beat, then has to admit the painful 
	truth.

					KIRA
			I don't think we can keep up this 
			pace.

	Shakaar turns and faces his troops.

					SHAKAAR
				(to all)
			All right.  Then we'll head for Tanis 
			Canyon.  Kira's on point... column 
			of twos after her... Lupaza take the

36   EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY

	Kira and Shakaar are hunkered down behind some rocks on the 
	top of a ridgeline, looking down into a box canyon.  They 
	both have their weapons out and are intently watching 
	something o.s.

37   KIRA'S POV

	From her perspective, we can see a LARGE NUMBER of BAJORAN 
	TROOPS (around 20 men and women) moving cautiously across 
	the canyon floor.  They are led by a Bajoran Colonel who we 
	will learn is named LENARIS.  The troops carry phaser rifles 
	and they are moving professionally through the canyon.  
	Several of them have tricorders out and are sweeping the 
	area.

38   RESUME KIRA & SHAKAAR

	Still watching the troops.

					SHAKAAR
				(quiet)
			I don't think they've picked us up 
			on their tricorders.

					KIRA
				(quiet)
			They won't, either.  Not with that 
			dampening field in place.

	Shakaar looks to his left.

39   SHAKAAR'S POV

	To his left, we can see Lupaza and two Bajoran N.D.s hunkered 
	down at a different location on the ridgeline.  They have 
	their weapons out and pointed at the oncoming troops.  Lupaza 
	sees Shakaar and signals that they're ready.

40   SHAKAAR

	glances to his right.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE          48.

41   SHAKAAR'S POV

	To his right, at yet another location on the ridge, we can 
	see Furel and another Bajoran N.D.  They also are well-
	concealed from the troops and have them covered with their 
	weapons.  Furel signals his readiness.

42   RESUME SHAKAAR & KIRA

	As they look down at the troopers approaching the ambush.  
	Kira suddenly reacts.

					KIRA
			I think I recognize that man...

					SHAKAAR
			Which one?

					KIRA
			The colonel.
				(beat)
			That's Lenaris Holem.

					SHAKAAR
			Lenaris?  From the Ornathia resistance 
			cell?

					KIRA
			I met him a year ago at a reception 
			in the Capital.

	There's a beat as they think about that.

					SHAKAAR
			He's good.  No wonder we haven't 
			lost them.
				(beat)
			We have to get him with the first 
			volley.  You take the Lieutenant on 
			the right.  I'll take Lenaris.

	Kira and Shakaar share a look -- they know this is a decisive 
	moment.  Then they both sight their weapons on the troops 
	below.

43   KIRA

	Settles her disruptor on one of the troopers... she closes 
	her eyes briefly... struggles to put her feelings aside... 
	but she's definitely having problems.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE         48A.

43A  POV SHAKAAR'S SCOPE (OPTICAL)

	Shakaar zero's the weapon directly on Lenaris.

44   ON SHAKAAR

	Shakaar's finger tenses on the trigger... then relaxes... 
	he's having trouble with this too.  He looks over at Kira 
	and the two of them share a look of mutual dread.  There's a 
	long beat as they both consider what they're about to do.  
	Then finally...

					KIRA
			I'm sorry.

					SHAKAAR
			Don't be.  I can't either.

	There's a beat, then Shakaar makes a decision.  He stands up 
	in full view of the troops below.  Kira stands up with him, 
	and they both drop their weapons as they calmly walk down 
	toward the troops.

45   ON LUPAZA

	Who's shocked at this sudden move.  She holds up a hand to 
	the other resistance fighters hidden along the ridgeline, 
	silently telling them to stay in place and wait to see what 
	happens.

46   ON LENARIS

	Who suddenly sees Kira and Shakaar walking down the hillside.  
	Lenaris stays calm... he's been in too many combat situations 
	to be taken aback by anything.  He gives low, quiet orders 
	without ever taking his eyes off Shakaar and Kira.

					LENARIS
				(to troops)
			Hold.  Set a perimeter and watch the 
			hills.  No one fires until I give 
			the order.

	The troopers obey instantly, spreading out and forming a 
	rough defensive circle.  The troopers eye the hills warily -- 
	they're professionals.  Lenaris walks outside the circle of 
	his men and approaches Shakaar and Kira.  Lenaris stops about 
	ten feet away from them.

					LENARIS
				(to Shakaar)
			That's far enough.

	They stop.

					LENARIS
				(continuing)
			Shakaar?

	Shakaar nods.  Lenaris looks questioningly at Kira.

					KIRA
			Kira Nerys.

	Lenaris frowns at her slightly.

					LENARIS
			We've met.

	Kira nods and Lenaris is satisfied with leaving it at that.  
	He turns his attention back to Shakaar.

					LENARIS
			I've wanted to thank you for a long 
			time.
				(off his look)
			I had a brother at Gallitep when you 
			liberated the camp.

					SHAKAAR
			A lot of people did.  I just wish 
			we'd gotten there sooner.

	Lenaris glances around up at the hills.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE         49A.

46   CONTINUED:

					LENARIS
			Well.  I take it from your... calm 
			demeanor that I've walked into an 
			ambush.
				(beat)
			I should've stayed up on the 
			ridgeline... never come down into 
			the valley.

					SHAKAAR
			It's an easy mistake to make... you 
			thought we were another two kilometers 
			ahead and you were trying to make up 
			time.  I might've done the same thing.

					LENARIS
			I think I should tell you that I've 
			been in worse situations.

					SHAKAAR
			The Pullock Five raid.

					LENARIS
			You know about that?

					SHAKAAR
			The first offworld raid against the 
			Cardassians?  Of course.  It was a 
			bold move.

					LENARIS
			If you know about Pullock Five, then 
			you should also know I won't give up 
			without a fight.  So if you're here 
			to ask me to surrender, you're wasting 
			your time.

	Shakaar nods... despite their situation, Shakaar already 
	likes Lenaris... respects him as a commander.

					SHAKAAR
			That's not why I'm here.
				(beat)
			I want to take my people... and walk 
			out of here.  I want to take them 
			home.

46A  NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Now it's Lenaris's turn to be mildly surprised, but before he 
	can say anything, a PHASER SHOT is FIRED by one of his men 
	up into the Hills.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE         49B.

46A  CONTINUED:

	Lenaris whirls around as the Troopers all tense and point 
	their weapons up at the hills -- everyone is about to let 
	loose.

					LENARIS
			Cease fire!  Cease fire!

47   ON FUREL

	As he prepares to fire back.  The other resistance fighters 
	prepare to open fire as well.

48   ON SHAKAAR

	As he turns and holds up a hand at his people up in the hills.

					SHAKAAR
				(shouts)
			Wait!

					KIRA
				(shouts)
			Stop!  No one fire!

	There's an extremely tense beat, with everyone looking and 
	waiting to see if anyone will continue the shooting... then 
	finally Lenaris strides over to the TROOPER who fired the 
	shot.

					TROOPER
			Sir, I... I saw someone... I thought 
			they were going to open fire...

	The Trooper trails off under Lenaris's glare.

					LENARIS
			Lieutenant.

	A Bajoran Lieutenant steps forward.

					LENARIS
				(cold, to Lieutenant)
			Take this man's weapon and get him 
			off the perimeter.

	The Lieutenant nods and quickly moves to disarm the Trooper 
	and get him out of the way.  Lenaris turns back to Kira and 
	Shakaar.

DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE          50.

48   CONTINUED:

					LENARIS
			Now.  I believe you were saying 
			something about wanting to walk out 
			of here... ?

					SHAKAAR
			That's right.

					LENARIS
			You know that's impossible.

					KIRA
			Then we better find a way to make it 
			possible or the next time someone 
			starts shooting, we won't be able to 
			stop it.  And I'm not just talking 
			about today... I'm talking about 
			tomorrow and the next day and the 
			next... I'm talking about the 
			beginning of a civil war.

	There's a beat as they all grapple with that frightening 
	possibility.

					SHAKAAR
			I didn't fight the Cardassians for 
			twenty-five years so that I could 
			start shooting other Bajorans.

	Beat.

					LENARIS
			Neither did I.
				(beat)
			So what do we do about it?

	They look at each other, desperately hoping to find an 
	answer...

49   EXT. BAJOR - STOCK MATTE SHOT (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

50   INT. FIRST MINISTER'S OFFICE

	The Kai is looking out the window, deep in thought.  There's 
	a CHIME.

					WINN
			What is it?

					ASSISTANT'S VOICE
			Colonel Lenaris is here to see you.

					WINN
			Send him in.

	Lenaris ENTERS, accompanied by Kira and Shakaar.  Winn is 
	surprised to see that the colonel is not alone.

					WINN
				(to Lenaris)
			I see you've brought me a pair of 
			gifts.  How thoughtful of you.

					LENARIS
			They're not my prisoners.

					WINN
				(annoyed)
			What do you mean they're not your 
			prisoners?  What's going on?

					SHAKAAR
			I'm here to enter the election... as 
			a candidate for the office of First 
			Minister.

					WINN
			You have an interesting sense of 
			humor.

					KIRA
			It's no joke.  Shakaar's going to 
			run in the election... and you're 
			going to lose.

					LENARIS
			I've consulted with the other army 
			commands and he has their full 
			support.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE          52.

50   CONTINUED:

					WINN
			So this is a coup.

					KIRA
			No.  It'll be a free election... if 
			you want to run, go ahead.  But if 
			you do, this entire incident will be 
			made public.  And when the people 
			know the real facts -- when they 
			know that you risked a civil war 
			over a couple of pieces of farm 
			equipment... they'll never trust you 
			again.
				(beat)
			You're still the Kai... the "spiritual 
			leader of Bajor."  But your days in 
			this office are numbered... so if I 
			were you, I'd start packing.

	OFF Winn's face as she realizes that Kira is right.

52   INT. QUARK'S

	Quark's is almost empty as O'Brien and Bashir are standing 
	in front of the dartboard.  O'Brien is flexing his shoulder 
	experimentally with a dart in his hand.  Quark is watching 
	nearby.

					BASHIR
			How's it feel?

					O'BRIEN
			Good so far... let's see...

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE          53.

52   CONTINUED:

	He throws the dart.

53   NEW ANGLE

	Close on the dart board as the dart buries itself on the far 
	edge of the board. (But still on the board.)

54   RESUME O'BRIEN

	As he reacts.

					BASHIR
			Try again, Chief.

					O'BRIEN
			No.  I can feel it... I'm out of the 
			zone.
				(beat)
			You know... I've played sports all 
			my life... and I've never been in 
			the zone like that.  And I probably 
			never will again... but it felt good 
			while it lasted.

	A somber beat, then Bashir tries to make him feel better.

					BASHIR
			Well, there is a bright side to all 
			this.  With that new shoulder, you 
			might finally finish that kayaking 
			program.

	O'Brien seems to brighten.

					O'BRIEN
			Hey.  You might be right.
				(to Quark)
			Quark, I need a holosuite.

	Quark waves his agreement and O'Brien EXITS with a happy 
	look on his face.  Bashir smiles and then casually tosses a 
	dart at the board.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE         53A.


55   ON THE BOARD

	The dart hits the bullseye.

56   ON BASHIR AND QUARK

	As they react.

					QUARK
			Doctor... welcome to the zone.

	Off Bashir's surprised reaction...

									CUT TO:

57   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS

	Kira and Sisko ENTER.  Kira is carrying a suitcase.

          DEEP SPACE: "Shakaar" - REV. 04/04/95 - ACT FIVE          54.

57   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Have any other candidates entered 
			the election?

					KIRA
			One or two... but Shakaar's popularity 
			is growing so fast that I don't think 
			anyone can catch him at this point.

					SISKO
			And what about the Kai?

					KIRA
			She's trying to make the best of 
			it... she even put out a statement 
			of support for Shakaar.

	Kira sits down and puts a hand to her back in pain.

					KIRA
			Oooh.  You know... I used to enjoy 
			sleeping on the ground.

	Sisko smiles a little.

					SISKO
			It's good to have you back, Major.

					KIRA
			It's good to be back, sir.

					SISKO
			I'll see you in Ops.

	Sisko nods and EXITS.  After he's gone, Kira puts down her 
	suitcase and walks over to Bareil's memorial lamp.  She looks 
	at it for a beat, then smiles fondly.

					KIRA
			Sleep well, Bareil.

	She blows out the lamp and we...

									FADE OUT.
