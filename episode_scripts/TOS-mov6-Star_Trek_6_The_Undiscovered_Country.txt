             It has come to my attention that unauthorized copies of the
             STAR TREK VI script have been made and distributed.

             Requests for copies of the script should only be made through
             my office (956-5797)

             Each script has been assigned both a number and an
             internal code, which allows us to trace the script even if
             the red number written on each page is somehow removed.

             A wide distribution of the script weakens the impact that
             STAR TREK can have at the box office.

             Please return your script to my office if it is not essential to 
             the making of this film. Please understand that this is necessary
             to help us deliver a fresh movie to our dedicated audience.

             Please help us maintain the secrecy of our project.
             Thank you for your help and cooperation.

                   The polyglot CREW is busy.

                   Seated in the CAPTAIN'S CHAIR, a familiar face: SULU.
                   He has his own command and is drinking a CUP of tea.

                   The SCIENCE OFFICER stands next to him, conferring,
                   handing him a datacount. Sulu muses over the contents.

                                           SULU
                             According to this we've completed
                             our exploration of the entire
                             sector.

                             home. Three years is...

                   The ship starts to TREMBLE.

                   shaking in its saucer... Sulu and the CREW look at
                   each other as the SHAKING increases. The TEACUP
                   SMASHES.

                   Kirk walks into shot.

              23   INT. STARFLEET BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                          23

                   The room fills with BEMEDALED BRASS, Kirk's CREW among
                   them - the only starship complement in the room. They
                   can't help looking at each other, questioning. They
                   are in uniforms.

                             Search me. Anybody know how come
                             we made the A list?

                             My shore leave was just cancelled.

                             Isn't this just for top brass?

                             Where is Mr. Sulu?

                             Captain Sulu... on assignment...
                             anyone seen Spock?

                   A door opens and STARFLEET ADMIRAL DONALD, austere and
                   impressive, enters and gavels the meeting to order.

                                           ADMIRAL DONALD
                             This briefing is classified. There
                             will be no recording devices.
                             Ladies and Gentlemen, the C-in-C.

                   All rise as the STARFLEET COMMANDER IN CHIEF enters
                   with a briefcase and pulls materials from it.

                                           CinC
                             As you were. I'll make this as
                             simple as I possibly can. The
                             Klingon empire has roughly 50 
                             years of life left to it.

                   They look at each other in disbelief.

                                           CinC
                                     (continuing)
                             For full details, I am turning this
                             briefing over to our Special
                             Federation Envoy.

                   He makes a sign and another door opens. Spock walks to
                   the podium. Kirk and company are astounded.

                                           SPOCK
                             Good morning.

             VFX   OMITTED                                                    VFX

                                           SPOCK
                                     (continuing)
                             Two months ago a Federation
                             Starship monitored an explosion on
                             the Klingon moon Praxis. We
                             believe it was caused by over mining
                             and insufficient safety precautions.
                             The moon's decimation means an
                             almost eighty percent loss of
                             available energy and a deadly
                             pollution of their ozone. Due to
                             their large military expenditures,
                             the Klingon economy is in a very
                             weakened condition. They do not
                             have sufficient resources to
                             manufacture air shelters in large
                             enough quantities to sustain
                             anything like their current
                             population. Last month - at the
                             behest of the, uh, Vulcan
                             Ambassador - I opened a dialogue
                             with Gorkon, Chancellor of the
                             Klingon High Council. He proposes
                             to commence negotiations at once.

                                           ADMIRAL DONALD
                             Negotiations for what?

                                           SPOCK
                             The dismantling of our space
                             stations and star bases along the
                             Neutral Zone, an end to seventy
                             years of unremitting hostility - a
                             hostility the Klingons can no
                             longer afford.

                   Audible mutterings. PAN the crew. Is the war over?

                                           SPOCK
                                     (continuing)
                             If the Klingons sue for peace, we
                             could accumulate savings in defense
                             expenditures, leaving the
                             Federation economy free to grapple
                             with urgent social problems...

                                           A MILITARY MAN
                             Bill, are we talking about
                             mothballing the Starfleet?

                                           CinC
                             I'm sure our exploration and
                             science programs would not be
                             affected, but the facts speak for
                             themselves, Captain.

                                           ADMIRAL DONALD
                             I must protest. To offer the
                             Klingons a safe haven within
                             Federation space is suicide.
                             Klingons would become the alien
                             trash of the galaxy. And if we
                             dismantle the fleet, we'd be
                             defenseless before a bellicose
                             people with a foothold on our
                             territory. The opportunity which
                             presents itself here is to embargo
                             trading, force them to run through
                             their own resources faster, and
                             bring them to their knees. Then
                             we'll be in a far better position
                             to dictate terms.

                   A vocal minority of the briefing supports this, but not
                   all. Kirk simply stares at Spock.

                                           CinC
                             Starfleet is under civilian
                             control, Admiral. The decision is
                             a political not a military one -
                             and it's been made.

                                           KIRK
                             Sir -

                             Captain Kirk?

                                     (eyes Spock briefly)
                             Sir, I'm no diplomat, but the
                             Klingons have never been 
                             trustworthy. I'm forced to agree
                             with Admiral Donald. This is - 
                                     (he gropes for tact)
                             - a terrible, a terrifying idea...

                                           CinC
                             Your son was killed by a Klingon,
                             wasn't he, Captain?

                                           KIRK
                             Yes, sir.

                                           CinC
                             I'm sorry. But Commander Spock has
                             persuaded the Federation that this
                             situation is too promising to
                             ignore.

                                           SPOCK
                             It is imperative that we act NOW to
                             support the Gorkon initiative, lest
                             more conservative elements persuade
                             his empire that it would be better
                             to attempt a military solution and
                             die fighting.

                                           CinC
                             Captain Kirk, you are to be our
                             first olive branch.

                                           KIRK
                             Me?

                                           SPOCK
                             We have volunteered to rendezvous
                             with the Klingon ship that's
                             bringing Chancellor Gorkon here,
                             and escort him safely through
                             Federation space.

                   Kirk is too startled to speak.

                                           CinC
                             As it happens, Kirk, the Chancellor
                             specifically requested you and your
                             officers.

                                           KIRK
                             Why, in God's name?

                                           CinC
                             There are some Klingons who feel
                             the same about the peace treaty as
                             yourself and Admiral Donald.
                             They'll think twice about attacking
                             the Enterprise under your command.

                             I have personally vouched for you
                             in this matter, Captain.

                   He moves off before Kirk can reply. The room is
                   empty...

                   except for Spock, still at the podium and Kirk sitting
                   alone in the auditorium. He is furious, betrayed.
                   Spock knows it.

                   He doesn't stop her.

                             I gather you are not enthusiastic
                             about the assignment... I don't
                             think many on board are.

                             mouth.

                   And leaves her with that.

                   Saavik approaches; this time she's smart enough to
                   KNOCK.

                   In contrast with his Spartan personality, the room is a
                   voluptuous incense-laden lair, filled with curtains and
                   smoke. Spock lights a votive candle; surveys her. He
                   is out of uniform.

                                           SPOCK

                             intellect. Do you not recognize
                             that a turning point has been
                             reached in the affairs of the

                   He starts to get into uniform.

                   The cruise is proceeding evenly as Kirk arrives out of
                   one turbo-lift. Spock and Lt. Saavik emerge from
                   another.

                   Spock looks at Kirk: trust me. Kirk scowls at him and
                   stares at the screen. They all follow his gaze.

                   He disappears. Kirk turns to Spock.

                   A WINDOW IRISES OPEN REVEALING the stars gliding by.

                   A HAND POURS DEEP BLUE ROMULAN ALE into Gorkon's
                   crystal goblet. Dinner well underway. Principles from

                             the future.

                   All drink ROMULAN ALE, echoing "the undiscovered
                   country." The KLINGONS eat with their fingers,
                   scorning utensils.

                             was illegal.

                   It takes Kirk a moment to regain his composure.

                             evening has been most... edifying.

                   Gorkon stares at him, smiles slightly.

                                           GORKON
                             You don't trust me.

                   Kirk can't look at him.

                             I don't blame you. If there IS to
                             be a Brave New World, we old people
                             will have the hardest time living

                   Kirk is ready to slug him but turns his fist into a

                   Chang speaks into his communicator, nods to Kirk.

              58   INT. GORKON'S STATEROOM, FLAGSHIP                           58

                   Chang and his ASSISTANTS are trying to sort things out
                   without gravity. Chang shouts efficient orders in
                   Klingon as he finds and tries to help Gorkon...

                   Chang keeps himself upright by grabbing a handhold, but
                   the stricken are still floating...

                   A few more orders from Chang, then the lights flicker,
                   then all the bodies and BLOOD slam to the ground as the
                   gravitational source is restored. Lighting is "NORMAL."

                   Kirk and Bones materialize. They are quickly
                   surrounded by ARMED SOLDIERS. Kirk puts his hands out
                   to indicate they are not carrying weapons. They are
                   searched as Kerla enters.

                   same path - a scene of destruction - which the hit men
                   took, right into

              61   INT. GORKON'S STATEROOM, FLAGSHIP                           61

                   where dead and wounded are being separated.

                   Kerla hurries over to Gorkon, askew on a rug, blood
                   running everywhere. Azetbur is holding him, now bloody
                   herself (she wasn't in the room during the
                   assassination).

                   Gorkon.

                   KLINGONS lift Gorkon onto his table; someone produces
                   LIGHT. Bones whips out his medical scanner. His hands
                   are SHAKING. A spage-age REMBRANDT painting.

                   Bones furiously goes over Gorkon with his anabolic
                   photoplaser. Shakes his head.

                   He tries a medical tricorder.

                   Frantically, he WHUMPS Gorkon's chest...

                   as Kirk et al, look, Gorkon feebly opens his eyes, sees
                   Kirk...

                             Are you all right?

                   HE FREEZES; Bones looks at the scanner. It burns
                   bright red. Gorkon is dead. Kirk is in shock: he was
                   for real.

                   Azetbur sits holding Gorkon, dry-eyed.

                   Kirk has to pull the stunned Bones away.

                                           UHURA
                             They've been arrested.

                   All eyes go to Spock. We can guess how he feels.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Mr. Spock, we've got to do
                             something!

                   The others crowd in, waiting for orders. Depending on
                   him.

                                     (finally)
                             I assume command of this ship as of
                                     (he checks)
                             0130 hours. Uhura, send to
                             Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely
                             what has taken place, and request
                             instructions.

                                           UHURA
                             Yes, sir.

                                           LT. SAAVIK
                             But we can't allow them to be taken
                             back to Kronos as prisoners.

                                           SPOCK
                             What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
                             Opening fire won't retrieve the
                             Captain; and an armed engagement
                             was precisely what he wished to
                             avoid.

                                           SCOTTY
                             At least we must keep track of
                             where they are taken, sir. I -

                                           SPOCK
                             I've already addressed that
                             question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able
                             to follow the Captain's movements.

                                           LT. SAAVIK
                             How did you - ?

                                           SPOCK
                             In the meantime we must endeavor to
                             piece together what happened here
                             tonight. According to our data
                             banks, this ship fired those
                             torpedoes.

                                           SCOTTY
                             NO WAY!

                                           SPOCK
                             Mr. Scott, you forget yourself.
                             Please accompany me.

                   He starts out -

                                           CHEKOV
                             And if we can't piece together what
                             happened? What then? Sir.

                   Spock turns unhappily.

                                           SPOCK
                             Then Mr. Chekov, it resides in the
                             hands of the diplomats.

              63   INT. OFFICE OF THE FEDERATION PRESIDENT - DAY               63

                   The FEDERATION PRESIDENT and the KLINGON AMBASSADOR.
                   With them is the VULCAN AMBASSADOR, SAREK - Spock's
                   father - and NANCLUS, the ROMULAN AMBASSADOR.

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             The Chancellor of the High Council
                             is dead - the result of an
                             unprovoked attack while he
                             traveled to see YOU under a flag
                             of truce on a mission of peace.
                             Captain Kirk was legally arrested
                             for the crime. May I remind you
                             that he and Doctor McCoy boarded
                             KRONOS ONE of their own free will.
                             None of these facts are in dispute,
                             Mr. President.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             I will demand a full investigation.
                             You can be assured we will
                             cooperate with all our power to get
                             to the bottom of the matter. In
                             the meantime --

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             In the meantime we expect the
                             Federation to abide by the articles
                             of Interstellar Law you claim to
                             cherish. Kirk and Doctor McCoy
                             WILL stand trial for the
                             assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Out of the question. Ambassador
                             Sarek, there must be some way to
                             extradite these men - 

                                           AMBASSADOR SAREK
                                     (heavily)
                             Mr. President, I share a measure of
                             personal responsibility in this
                             matter, but I am obliged to confirm
                             my esteemed colleagues legal
                             interpretation: Kirk and Dr. McCoy
                             were properly arrested, and the
                             Klingons are within their rights to
                             try them.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             And what is the position of the
                             Romulan government, Ambassador
                             Nanclus?

                                           AMBASSADORT NANCLUS
                                     (wily)
                             In the absence of specific
                             instructions from my government, I
                             must concur with my colleagues.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             But surely you cannot believe that
                             James Kirk assassinated the
                             Chancellor of the High Council.

                                           AMBASSADOR NANCLUS
                                     ("reluctant")
                             Mr. President, I don't know what to
                             believe.

                                           KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                             I am waiting for your answer, Mr.
                             President.

                   Long pause.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             This President is not above the
                             law.

                   The Klingon Ambassador bows and takes his leave.

                   The President is left with the two Ambassadors.

                                           SEC'Y VOICE
                             Mr. President, Starfleet Command is
                             here from San Francisco.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Send them in.

                   Three OFFICERS from Starfleet - including Admiral
                   Donald and the CinC - enter from a DIFFERENT DOOR.

                                           ADMIRAL DONALD
                             Mr. President.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Admiral Donald...Bill...

                                           ADMIRAL DONALD
                             Mr. President we cannot allow
                             Federation citizens to be abducted.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             At present I'm awaiting a full
                             report from Enterprise. Pending
                             that I am constrained to observe
                             Interstellar Law.

                   A stand off. Donald nods to another OFFICER.

                                           OFFICER
                             I've prepared Operation Retrieve
                             based on the rising danger of
                             terrorism and hostility between the
                             Klingon empire and the Federation.
                                     (hands the President a CD)
                             Put simply, we can go in and rescue
                             the Starfleet hostages and be out
                             in 24 hours with an acceptable rate
                             of loss in manpower and equipment.
                             We have the technology --

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Suppose you precipitate a full
                             scale war?

                                           OFFICER
                             Then, quite frankly, Mr. President
                             we can clean their chronometers.

                                           AMBASSADOR NANCLUS
                             Mr. President, they ARE vulnerable.
                             There'll never be a better time...

                   Pause as the President considers.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             I'd prefer not to be the President
                             to push the button if I can avoid
                             it.

                                           ADMIRAL DONALD
                             The longer we wait, the less
                             accessible the hostages will be,
                             Mr. President.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I
                             think that's all.

                                           CinC
                             Sir.

                   The President looks at him.

                                           CinC
                                     (continuing)
                             Those men have literally saved this
                             planet - and you know it.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             I do know it. And I'm afraid
                             they're going to save it again. By
                             standing trial.

                   They're dismissed. The President puts his head in his
                   hands...finally looks up at Sarek.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Do you know I agree with everything
                             they said?

                                           AMBASSADOR SAREK
                             I'm sorry, Mr. President. And I
                             know my son must feel equally
                             responsible. It was at my request
                             that he persuaded Kirk to undertake
                             this mission.

                   The President looks at him.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             I want the crew of Enterprise in my
                             office tomorrow morning.

                                           AMBASSADOR SAREK
                             They're still in space, Mr.
                             President - adjacent to the Neutral
                             Zone.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Then tell your son to get the hell
                             back here before the end of the
                             week.

                   He swallows some pills.

                   shoulder. In Uhura's EARPIECE we can HEAR filtered
                   SCREAMING! She can hardly stand the volume.

                             We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and

                             We've been ordered to -

                                           LT. SAAVIK
                             In nineteenth century France,
                             workers who felt their livelihood
                             threatened by machines, flung their
                             wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into
                             the gears to stop them. Hence the
                             word SABOTAGE.

                                           UHURA
                             We are experiencing a technical
                             malfunction. All backup systems
                             inoperative.

                             Excellent. I mean too bad.

                             I will inform Captain Spock.

              65   OFFICE OF THE FEDERATION PRESIDENT - DAY                    65

                   The President is meeting with SIX civilian ADVISERS.

                                           MUNITIONS BUSINESSMAN
                             You have our total support, Mister
                             President. My factories are
                             standing by. We can gear up to
                             full weapons production in less
                             than a week.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Thank you, Henry. Right now we're
                             pursuing diplomatic channels...

                                           MUNITIONS BUSINESSMAN
                             Of course. No one wants a war...

                                           AMBASSADOR SAREK
                             If I may, Mr. President. The
                             important thing is to keep the
                             peace process alive. If the new
                             Chancellor is so disposed, perhaps
                             we can attach a rider, get some
                             assurance that these men won't be
                             executed. Then, in a year -

                                           SEC'Y VOICE
                             Mr. President, you have the new
                             Chancellor of the High Council
                             calling.

                   They all swing to look at the far wall, which

              65   lights up as a visual display. After a snowy                65
             VFX   beginning, Azetbur appears.                                VFX

                                           AZETBUR
                             Mr. President, I've been named
                             Chancellor of the High Council in
                             my father's place.

                   Reactions in the room.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             Madam Chancellor, you have my
                             sincerest condolences on your
                             recent loss. I want to assure you
                             that this shameful deed --

                                           AZETBUR
                             Mr. President, let us come to the
                             point: you want the conference to
                             go forward and so did my father. I
                             will attend in one week - after
                             I've had the opportunity to master
                             the details of this position - on
                             one condition: we will not
                             extradite the prisoners and you
                             will not attempt to rescue them in
                             a military operation. We would
                             consider any such attempt an act 
                             of war.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             We look forward to meeting with you
                             next week, Madam Chancellor. I hope
                             you will be our guest here on --

                                           AZETBUR
                             After recent events you will
                             understand I prefer a neutral site.
                             And in the interests of security,
                             let us keep the location secret.

                                           PRESIDENT
                             As you wish, Madam Chancellor.

                   She clicks off. The President and his advisers are a
                   little speechless at her strength and brusqueness.

                             Attack them now, Madam Chancellor -
                             while we still can...!

                   He unfurls battle plans...

                                           FIRST GENERAL
                             Attack or be slaves in their world!

                                           SECOND GENERAL
                             We can take whole by force what
                             they propose to divide...!

                                           AZETBUR
                                     (weary)
                             You don't seem to understand our
                             situation, General. War is...
                             obsolete. As we are in danger of
                             becoming.

                                           KERLA
                             Better to die on our feet than live
                             on our knees...

                                           AZETBUR
                                     (quickly)
                             That wasn't what my father wanted -

                                           CHANG
                                     (bitter)
                             He was killed for what he wanted.

                   That sinks in. Azetbur hardens. Faces Chang.

                                           AZETBUR
                             Kirk must have a fair trial.

                                           CHANG
                             Of course.

                                           AZETBUR
                                     (stony)
                             But I want a conviction. You will
                             represent the State, General Chang.

                                           CHANG
                             With the greatest pleasure, Madam
                             Chancellor.

              69   INT. TORPEDO BAY, USS ENTERPRISE                            69

                   Spock and Scotty hover over the torpedo console,
                   looking at numbers and lights. Spock thinks hard.
                   EIGHT BELLS SOUND. It is perfectly clear: according to
                   the "INVENTORY" program ALL TORPEDOES ARE STILLL ABOARD.

                                           SCOTTY
                             It's as I said, Mr. Spock:
                             Inventory still registers every
                             torpedo.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (musing)
                             Yet the data banks insist we fired:
                             twice. One computer is lying.

                                           SCOTTY
                             A computer canna lie, sir.

                                           SPOCK
                             I think  not.

                                           SCOTTY
                             You can check the torpedoes
                             visually, if you like -

                                           SPOCK
                             We'll have to check every one of
                             them, Mr. Scott.

                                           SCOTTY
                             That could take hours!

                                           SPOCK
                             Nevertheless.

                                           SCOTTY
                             And if they're still in place?

                                           SPOCK
                             Then someone forged a data bank
                             entry.

                   Lieutenant Saavik descends into the bay.

                                           LT. SAAVIK
                             They've named Gorkon's daughter
                             Chancellor - it was on the news.

                                           SCOTTY
                             I'll bet that Klingon bitch killed
                             her father...

                                           SPOCK
                             Her own father...?

                                           LT. SAAVIK
                             Such things have happened before,
                             sir.

                                           SCOTTY
                             They don't place the same value on
                             life that we do, Spock - you know
                             that... take my word: she didn't
                             shed one bloody tear...

                                           SPOCK
                             That's hardly conclusive, Mr.
                             Scott, as Klingons have no tear
                             ducts.

                   Before he can react.

                   THE KLINGON EMPIRE IN ALL ITS BARBARIC SPLENDOR

                   A cavernous stadium arranged in circular tiers cut from
                   jagged stone. A place from a bygone age, of savage and
                   awesome beauty. Something between a CIRCUS and a
                   CATHEDRAL.

                   ... turned for the occasion into a gigantic COURTROOM
                   with thousands of spectators... SCREAMING: "KIRK! KIRK!
                   KIRK!

                   Many in the AUDIENCE hold SPEARS with lighted HEADS.

                   Kirk and Bones in the dock, stand in the bottom at the
                   very center of the circle, surrounded by a Klingon
                   AUDIENCE in rising tiers, while HOODED KLINGON JUDGES
                   sit invisible in a darkened dugout. (One Judge is an
                   ALBINO.)

                   CHANG wears the prosecutor's mantle.

                   In the audience is President Azetbur and her ADVISORS.
                   The trial is being BROADCAST and special CAMERAS
                   abound.

                   Near Kirk and Bones sit their young, eager Klingon
                   DEFENSE ATTORNEY. Kirk keeps his cool throughout,
                   though Bones tends to steam.

                   The rules are different. Attorneys are empowered to
                   ask anyone present a question at any time. And to mix
                   this up with statements and charges.

                   The proceedings BEGIN in subtitled KLINGON. Kirk and
                   Bones wear HEADPHONES. When they speak a TRANSLATOR
                   converts to Klingon...

                   As Chang gets going, we ZOOM into his MOUTH and he
                   converts to ENGLISH... the JUDGES' GAVEL IS A GROTESQUE

                             provocation, the Chancellor and his
                             advisers having been lulled into a
                             false sense of security with an
                             invitation to a state dinner aboard
                             Captain Kirk's vessel at 1930 hours
                             that same evening.
                             Do you deny all this?

                   The mob howls "Kirk!" as the Judge gavels.

                                           JUDGE
                             It is the judgment of this court
                             that the defendants are guilty as
                             charged.

                   Sensation in court. A BOOMING CHANT "KOOM! KOOM!" as
                   all the LIGHT SPEARS are pointed at Kirk and Bones.
                   Chang is stone-faced. AGAIN THE HORRIBLE GAUNTLET.

                             Have either of you anything to say
                             before this court passes sentence?

                             We were framed.

                             I wish to note for the record that
                             the evidence against my clients is
                             entirely circumstantial. I beg the
                             court to consider this when framing
                             its sentence.

                             So noted. In view of Colonel
                             Worf's plea, the sentence of death
                             is commuted. It is the judgment
                             of this court that without
                             possibility of reprieve or parole,
                             you be taken from this place to the

                             to say, but has it occurred to... to
                             any of us... that the Captain is...
                             that is, we know his feelings about

                             There was an enormous neutron

                   A small moving DARK MASS as we push in, REVEALS

                   FIFTEEN PRISONERS in leg irons and FIVE KLINGON GUARDS
                   with JACKAL-MASTIFFS moving slowly across the frigid
                   plain.

                   Kirk and Bones, likewise shackled, are among them.
                   GUARDS and PRISONERS alike wear ragged furs.

                   They reach a lone TOTEM and a GUARD holds up his hand
                   for a halt. He presses an instrument emitting a high-
                   pitched WHINE.

                   In response, A HUGE TRAP DOOR, buried in the snow,
                   yawns open. A KLINGON GUARD emerges from steps below
                   and places a BOX before the gaping DOOR.

                   As Kirk and Bones watch, the COMMANDANT of RURA PENTHE
                   and his JACKAL MASTIFF emerge. He mounts the box.

                             This is Rura Penthe. Observe:
                             there is no stockade, no guard
                             tower, no electrified frontier.
                             They are not needed. Only a

                   He blows a mechanical WHISTLE: in response, TWO GUARDS
                   emerge from below with a SCREAMING KLINGON CONVICT.

                                           PRISONER
                             NO! NOOOOO!

                                           COMMANDANT
                             Punishment means EXILE from prison
                             to the surface - on the surface
                             nothing can survive.

                   The GUARDS dump the screaming CONVICT on the ice - 
                   without furs. The weather immobilizes him at once -
                   his cries become fainter.

                                           COMMANDANT
                                    (continuing)
                             Below no one can escape. Work well
                             and you will be treated well. Work
                             badly and you will die.

                   He leaves; the box is removed by a guard and proceeds
                   him through the huge door and down the steps.

             91A   LONG SHOT                                                  91A

                   as the prisoners are herded after him and the door
                   shuts, leaving the frozen vista as it was; snow
                   flurries obscure the trap door almost instantly. Only
                   the frozen corpse of the CONVICT is left - until it too
                   is covered.

                   START LOOKING UP AT THE CLOSING TRAP DOOR - outside we
                   can see SNOW flurries as the panel shuts with a CLANG.

                   PAN DOWN TO REVEAL

                   A huge underground labyrinth with an enormous courtyard
                   surrounded by prisoner huts open to the center.
                   PRISONERS wander freely within. The scum of the
                   universe.

                   Everyone wears furs, LEG IRONS and is FREEZING.

                   On endless scaffolding above, the GUARDS.

                   Many of the PRISONERS look like they could snap Kirk
                   and Bones in two with one hand.

                   Kirk and Bones step gingerly around the outside wall,
                   watching the yard. A shadow falls across them.

                   Under Lt. Saavik's watchful eye, CREWMEN are taking the
                   kitchen apart. All sorts of dishes and cutlery litter
                   the place. Spock, Scotty, and Chekov enter.

                             them. Surely they've disposed of
                             these boots by now. Wouldn't it
                             have been logical to leave them on

                             restored by the time they escaped.
                             Without their boots they would not
                             have stayed on the Klingon

                             boots will cling to the killers'
                             necks like Tiberian bats. They
                             couldn't make their escape without
                             them; nor can they simply throw
                             them out a window for all to see;
                             no - they're here. Somewhere.

              93   INT. RURA PENTHE PENAL COLONY                               93

                   Kirk gets hit in the face. It's already BLOODY. It's
                   a prison fight. Kirk and an ALIEN are surrounded by
                   PRISONERS & GUARDS cheering and jeering.

                   Kirk and Bones are distinctly grubbier.

                   Kirk scrambles to his feet and circles. The Alien
                   swings a large paw but Kirk ducks, comes in with an
                   uppercut. He connects, but does little damage. They
                   circle some more. The Alien dives legs first and
                   scissors Kirk, who goes down roughly. Wrestling, Kirk
                   slips free.

                   Bones and Martia watch... the leg irons make it
                   complicated - they can also wrap around someone's
                   neck...

                   The Alien moves in closely, hits Kirk again. Kirk
                   fights back with a kick to the chest, which doubles
                   over the Alien.

              93   Then Kirk slams the ALIEN on the neck and he goes down.     93
                   Kirk starts to walk away.

                   But a paw reaches out and grabs him by the ankle. Kirk
                   looks back and the Alien is grinning, drags him in.
                   Stands and grips Kirk's chest to back in a giant bear
                   hug. Surely he will crush the life out of Kirk.

                   He lifts Kirk right off the ground. Kirk, almost gone,
                   lifts his legs up high and swings down hard, smashing
                   the Alien in the knee. That does it. The Alien falls
                   to the ground, screaming and holding his knee.

                             holding a grudge.

                             Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?

                   Bones tentatively goes forward and examines the knee.
                   He is without any medical tools of any kind.

                   The Alien yells but let's him look. He manipulates the
                   leg, then ties a kind of splint with an old rag...

                   Kirk looks at Martia. She shakes her head.

                   under the watchful eye of fur-clad KLINGON GUARDS.

                   An ALIEN next to Kirk sneaks several of the crystals

                   depths of the mine. They follow, looking back to make
                   sure the Guards aren't watching.

                   The girl quickly scrambles through the small hole, turns
                   and waves them on. They have to get down on their
                   stomachs and crawl through. Kirk goes first, turns,

                   Grimly, under funded and undermanned. God knows what
                   forsaken place this is. Rocks are lit by SCOPES...

                   A SLEEPY KLINGON dozes before his scanners. A bottle
                   in front of him tells the story. SUDDENLY A BLIP. HE
                   forces himself into alert attention.

                   to the first. What's going on?

                   in half. It glows brightly like a neon FLARE. He tosses
                   it in the middle of the area and it forms a kind of

                   Deserted. Scotty, exhausted, is quietly having a cup 
                   of coffee and checking off places searched on a table 
                   map.

                   He runs a finger around his collar. It's warm in
                   here...

                   Perplexed, he puts his hand over the vent. Nothing
                   coming out. Something blocking it?

                   Scotty commences removing the vent cover. Not easy.

                   As he continues his efforts, he is unaware of the TWO
                   CREWMEN we met the night of the banquet, watching.
                   They remain concealed, pull knives... one wants to go
                   for Scotty. The other holds him back.

                   Scotty removes the vent cover and pulls out what's been
                   blocking the air circulation: two violet-stained
                   Starfleet uniforms, with names on them...

                   Excited by his discovery, Scotty looks around, replaces
                   the vent cover and hurries out with the uniforms.

                             assassination.

                             The Conference is at Camp Khitomer,
                             near the Romulan border. I'm
                             sending the exact coordinates on a
                             coded frequency.

                             I'm afraid we may need more than
                             that. There's a Bird of Prey on
                             the lookout for us. And she can
                             fire while she's cloaked.

                   He hangs up. Finds himself facing his 1st OFFICER.

                             betraying my country or betraying
                             my friend, I'd have the guts to
                             betray my country. Warp nine,

                   The lights are dim as Kirk knocks. He has shaved,
                   showered and put on a fresh uniform.

                                           KIRK
                             Spock?

                   No answer. Kirk makes to hit the switch.

                             I'd prefer it dark.

                   Fair enough. Kirk enters.

                             You were right: it was arrogant
                             presumption that got us into this
                             situation. You might have died.

                             The night is young. Anyway, it was
                             logical.
                                     (he realizes he must
                                      feel his way)
                             You know, you're a great one for
                             logic. I'm a great one for

                             tread. We're both extremists.
                             Reality is probably somewhere in
                             between us.

                   Spock says nothing. Kirk runs a finger over dust.

                             HER - and I did nothing. I trusted
                             too much.

                             entry into my log. You were proud
                             of her achievements as a Vulcan.

                             I was PREJUDUCED by those
                             achievements.

                   Spock looks at him for the first time.

                             Can we two have grown so old and
                             inflexible that we have outlived
                             our usefulness?

                             not responsible just because she is

                             Spock, you want to know something?

                   Spock looks at him. Kirk kneels next to him.

                   He holds out his hand; after hesitating, Spock takes
                   it, presses it to his forehead. Hard. HARDER.

                                           UFP PRESIDENT
                             We are gathered here today in high
                             hopes, believing that differing
                             civilizations of good will can work
                             together to overcome intolerance.
                             We believe that with understanding
                             and patience it will be possible to
                             resolve what separates us. Let us
                             redefine progress to mean that just
                             because we CAN do a thing it does
                             not necessarily follow that we MUST
                             do that thing.

                   APPLAUSE.

                                           UFP PRESIDENT

                             We believe that the responsibility
                             for destiny rests squarely on our
                             own shoulders...

                             Captain, perhaps we're going about
                             this the wrong way; our job is to
                             get to the conference; HER job will
                             be to stop us.

                             ... many people speculated about my
                             father's motives. There were those
                             who said he was an idealist, driven
                             by visionary notions; others said
                             he had no choice, that he was a
                             pragmatic technocrat, making the
                             best of a devastating situation.
                             Great men are seldom good men. The
                             truth is my father was both: a
                             pragmatist and an idealist. If
                             Praxis hadn't exploded, then quite
                             possibly his idealism would not
                             have found expression. Nor would
                             mine. We are a proud race. We are
                             here because we want to go on being

                   Kelley's, James Doohan's, George Takei's, Walter
                   Koenig's, Nichelle Nichols'... one by one...

                   races by, and they disappear into the distance.
