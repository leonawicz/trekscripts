Title: Survival Instinct
Stardate: 53049.2
Original Airdate: September 25, 1999


[Planet surface - swamp]

TWO OF NINE: Input failure.
FOUR OF NINE: Input failure.
THREE OF NINE: Input failure.
SEVEN: Our link to the Collective has been severed. Initiate secondary
protocols. The vessel's transwarp chamber is approaching critical
pressure. We must evacuate this area.
ALL: Agreed.
TWO OF NINE: No directional co-ordinates available.
SEVEN: That way. Bearing three zero one.
ALL: Agreed:
SEVEN: Bring that drone.

Captain's Log: Stardate 53049.2. We've docked at the Markonian outpost
and agreed to mutual visits, so I'm allowing shore leave to anyone who
wants it. Commander Tuvok has objected to taking on too many visitors,
but security issues aside, I'm looking forward to a cultural exchange,
and making some new friends.

[Ready room]

CHAKOTAY: Captain!
JANEWAY: I'll be right with you. The station manager didn't tell me the
vines were prehensile. I went to put some water in the pot and it grabbed
me.
CHAKOTAY: This is a gift from the Kinbori delegation. I don't know its
name, only that it's used in one of their sacred games and it's very
heavy.
JANEWAY: Put it down anywhere. Thank the Kinbori for me and give them a
token of our esteem.
CHAKOTAY: I already gave them a Voyager medallion. They seemed
appreciative.
JANEWAY: Come in. Doesn't it look like Christmas morning in here,
Commander?
CHAKOTAY: You have to admit the generosity of our guests is very
impressive.
TUVOK: As is their proclivity for criminal behaviour. This morning's
security report.
JANEWAY: A broken ODN line, some missing personal items, a damaged
scanner relay. All in all, not that bad.
TUVOK: There is a second page to the report.
JANEWAY: Some of these incidents are a little more serious but, on
balance, I still think we did the right thing.
TUVOK: There is a third page.
CHAKOTAY: Come on, Tuvok. After all the xenophobic races we've run into,
don't you find it just a little refreshing to meet some people who value
openness and freedom?
JANEWAY: Well as far as I'm concerned, opening the ship has been a
fascinating experience and an unqualified success. I'm very pleased.
CHAKOTAY: Me too.
TUVOK: I am pleased that you are pleased. If you'll excuse me.
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok. Please accept this token of our esteem.
JANEWAY: Ooh, ow! It's got me by the hair!

[Astrometrics lab]

NAOMI: Now it's twelve forty five.
SEVEN: If you're hungry you may eat without me.
NAOMI: You said we'd have lunch together.
SEVEN: I haven't completed my analysis of the station's power conversion
matrix.
NAOMI: How long is it going to take?
SEVEN: Several hours.
NAOMI: Seven, you promised.
SEVEN: Very well.

[Corridor]

NAOMI: I think it's even more crowded than this morning.
SEVEN: Yes.
NAOMI: Excuse us. Excuse us. Please, we're trying to get through to the
turbolift. Excuse us.
SEVEN: Stand aside!
NAOMI: Thank you.

[Mess hall]

NEELIX: I'm sorry, but there's no more marsupial surprise. We only had
two kilos of pouches to begin with, and it's all gone. Now how about some
pizza, huh?
NAOMI: She's a Shivolian, right?
SEVEN: Correct.
NAOMI: Species five two one?
SEVEN: Your mother would not approve of you memorising Borg designations.
I don't approve either. We've discussed the impropriety of you emulating
the Borg.
NAOMI: Sorry.
SEVEN: I'm finished.
NAOMI: We just sat down.
SEVEN: I do not enjoy crowds.
NAOMI: But you were in the Collective. Wasn't that like a big crowd?
SEVEN: Which is why I do not enjoy them now.
NAOMI: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise that. Let's go.
TWO OF NINE: Excuse me. Are you Seven of Nine?
SEVEN: Yes.
NAOMI: You okay?
SEVEN: These are Borg synaptic relays from my original unimatrix.
NAOMI: These are yours?
SEVEN: Where did you acquire them?
TWO OF NINE: A trader from Orendal Five. I was told you are a former Borg
drone and might be interested in acquiring these pieces.
SEVEN: I'll take them. Captain Janeway will provide you with whatever
monetary reimbursement you require.
TWO OF NINE: Agreed.
SEVEN: I must examine these items more closely.
NAOMI: Okay. What's your name? That was rude.
TWO OF NINE [OC]: Stage two is complete. She has the relays.

[Engineering]

TWO OF NINE [OC}: She's going to study them.
THREE OF NINE [OC]: Her regeneration alcove is in Cargo Bay Two.

[Corridor]

FOUR OF NINE [OC]: That's where she'll go. We should prepare for stage
three.

[Engineering]

THREE OF NINE[OC]: Agreed.

[Mess hall]

TWO OF NINE [OC]: There's consensus. Rendezvous at my co-ordinates and
stand by to penetrate their security.

[Planet surface]

FOUR OF NINE: Error.
SEVEN: Explain.
FOUR OF NINE: We shouldn't be desecrating the body of this drone. It is
against the will of Brothara.
THREE OF NINE: Who is Brothara?
TWO OF NINE: Brothara. supernatural deity worshipped by species five
seven one.
FOUR OF NINE: I am a member of species five seven one.
SEVEN: You're being confused by irrelevant data. Ignore it.
THREE OF NINE: You said I am a member of species five seven one. Do you
consider yourself an individual?
SEVEN: There are no individuals here. We are Borg.
ALL: Agreed.
SEVEN: Resume constructing the communications beacon.

[Cargo Bay two]

TORRES: It looks like a standard Borg synaptic relay.
SEVEN: There must be something more. When I first came into contact with
it I was overwhelmed with images. Memories. Sounds.
TORRES: Sounds like a perfectly natural reaction to me. That was part
your old unimatrix, right? Well, isn't it at least possible that what you
experienced was simply nostalgia? You know, sentimental feelings about
the past.
SEVEN: I know what nostalgia is, but I have no feelings about the past.
TORRES: Okay. I think I've done all I can here.
SEVEN: Lieutenant. You were trying to help. I appreciate that.
TORRES: Anytime. Oh, and, er, you may not be nostalgic about the past,
but I'd say you definitely have feelings about it. Strong ones.

[Mess hall]

TWO OF NINE [OC]: Their security protocols are formidable. We may not
have enough time.
FOUR OF NINE [OC]: I'm worried about Seven of Nine. We should re-examine
the question of simply asking.
THREE OF NINE [OC]: You know what her reactions will be. She won't help
us because she.
TWO OF NINE [OC]: We've been through all that.
FOUR OF NINE [OC] She could be permanently injured. I don't want to harm
her.
TWO OF NINE: Enough!
THREE OF NINE: We need consensus.
TWO OF NINE: We can't act without it.
FOUR OF NINE: I know.
TWO OF NINE: So then it's up to you. Do we proceed or not?
FOUR OF NINE: Yes. We, I apologise for my indecision.
THREE OF NINE: Apologies are irrelevant.

[Cargo Bay two]

SEVEN: Computer, begin multi-polar analysis.
COMPUTER: Analysis underway.
SEVEN: Time to completion?
COMPUTER: Five hours, seventeen minutes.

[Mess hall]

TWO OF NINE: She's regenerating.
THREE OF NINE: Begin rerouting their internal sensors.
FOUR OF NINE [OC]: Rerouting sensor input to secondary processors.

[Turbolift]

THREE OF NINE: Hold.

[Bridge]

CHAKOTAY: What have you got?
TUVOK: There's a power fluctuation in the security grid.

CHAKOTAY: All we know is that we've got a security breach. We don't know
where.

[Cargo Bay two]

TWO OF NINE: Ready. Insert the interlink module.
THREE OF NINE: Ready.
TWO OF NINE: He's still worried about injuring her.
THREE OF NINE: If we fail, we'll never become individuals. We have to
remember that.
TWO OF NINE: There is consensus. I've found her memory files.
THREE OF NINE: She's aware of our presence.
TWO OF NINE: She's trying to regain consciousness.
FOUR OF NINE: We must abort.
THREE OF NINE: No! We're too close.
SEVEN: I will not comply.

[Planet surface - campfire]

SEVEN: I have performed this action before. I was with my father. He was
a tall man.
TWO OF NINE: I have a similar memory but, I was in a house and the fire
was in the hearth.
FOUR OF NINE: The biomatter is ready.
THREE OF NINE: It tastes similar to a bird I once ate.
FOUR OF NINE: I used to prepare food for my parents. They lived in a
small building by a river.
SEVEN: I used to be afraid of the dark.
TWO OF NINE: Just before I was assimilated, I was eating with a group of
men. We worked in numbers. Mathematics. I calculated equations for
another man.
THREE OF NINE: I have a name. It's Marika. Marika Willkarah. Willkarah.
TWO OF NINE: Hello, Marika Willkarah.
SEVEN: Her designation is Three of Nine.
FOUR OF NINE: I have a name. P'Chan, son of Dornar and Ansha. My primary
function was to care for them.
THREE OF NINE: I was married. We were on a starship, the Excalibur. I
worked in Engineering.
TWO OF NINE: This is not my hand.
FOUR OF NINE: My parents are dead. The Borg killed them. I hate the Borg.
SEVEN: This is counterproductive. We must delete all irrelevant data.
TWO OF NINE: I want my hand back.
THREE OF NINE: I was on duty, the night watch, when the Borg came. Oh, my
God, look at what they've done to me. These, these things they put in my
body. What have they done?
SEVEN: Command override. Cease this interaction. Comply! We will not
access these memory files again. Initiate the prescribed maintenance and
survival protocols only. No further communication is required until we
are re-assimilated into the Collective.
TWO OF NINE: Agreed.
THREE OF NINE: Agreed.
FOUR OF NINE: Agreed.

[Sickbay]

EMH: But whoever removed their implants was a poor surgeon. Their
internal organs were damaged during the procedure and their bodies are
covered with scars.
JANEWAY: You said you recognised them.
SEVEN: Not at first, but when they attempted to access my memory files I
was momentarily linked with them. Two of Nine. Three of Nine. Four of
Nine. We were all members of the same Unimatrix.
JANEWAY: Do you know why they were trying to access your memories?
SEVEN: No.
JANEWAY: How long have they been disconnected from the Collective?
EMH: Three or four months. However, they are still connected to each
other. Somehow, the left parietal lobes of their brains have been
transformed into organic interlink nodes. They've become linked together
into a sort of collective triad.
JANEWAY: Revive them. I'm Captain Janeway. We know who you are and we
know what you were trying to do. What we don't know is why.
TWO OF NINE: She has information we need.
JANEWAY: What kind of information?
TWO OF NINE: We want to become
THREE OF NINE: Individuals.
JANEWAY: You want to break the neural link between the three of you?
THREE OF NINE: Wouldn't you? None of us is alone with our own thoughts,
our own feelings.
TWO OF NINE: Every day of my life is spent hearing their two voices in my
head.
FOUR OF NINE: When we're asleep we experience each other's dreams.
EMH: How's that different from life in the Collective?
SEVEN: In the Collective there are billions of voices. They become white
noise.
TWO OF NINE: But with only three
THREE OF NINE: Each voice comes through clearly.
FOUR OF NINE: It has to stop. We must break the neural link.
JANEWAY: Doctor, is there anything you can do?
EMH: The modifications are too extensive. Their neuronal pathways have
been fundamentally altered.
TWO OF NINE: You hold the key.
SEVEN: Why?
THREE OF NINE: You were there with us.
FOUR OF NINE: Planet one eight six five alpha. You must remember.
SEVEN: Eight years ago our vessel crashed. The four of us were the only
survivors.
TWO OF NINE: When we were re-assimilated
THREE OF NINE: We found we'd been linked together somehow
FOUR OF NINE: We were a subset within the Collective
TWO OF NINE: It's like having three voices whispering in one ear
THREE OF NINE: And a crowd screaming in the other
FOUR OF NINE: We had to break free, so we worked together. We finally
escaped.
TWO OF NINE: We had our implants removed on Inavar Prime.
THREE OF NINE: But they couldn't break the neural link.
FOUR OF NINE: We need to find out what happened eight years ago, after
the crash.
TWO OF NINE: The night we were re-assimilated into the Collective. We
need to know how the link was created but our memories are
THREE OF NINE: Fragmented, disorganised. We hoped that you would know.
SEVEN: I don't. However, I am willing to attempt to retrieve the data.
Come with me.

[Cargo Bay Two]

SEVEN: Are you ready?
FOUR OF NINE: Yes.
SEVEN: Data search complete. Do you remember anything further?
FOUR OF NINE: No. My last memory
THREE OF NINE: Is of us standing
ALL: Around the campfire
SEVEN: And yet the data files in your cortical processor appear to be
intact. I see no evidence that would explain your lapse in memory.
TWO OF NINE: What about you? Why don't you remember what happened?
SEVEN: I don't know. I've found no evidence of damage to my memory files
either. I remember the campfire and then waking up in the Collective.
There is an obvious gap, but no indication of why.
TWO OF NINE: Why do they still call you Seven? You should have a name.
SEVEN: It is my name.
FOUR OF NINE: No. It's a designation. You're an individual now.
SEVEN: I decided that my former name was no longer appropriate. Prepare
to reinitialise the memory cascade.
THREE OF NINE: I can't wait to use my real name again.
SEVEN: There is nothing preventing you from doing so.
TWO OF NINE: Except that most of the time I don't know whether my name is
Marika, P'Chan or Lansor. The names, the memories
FOUR OF NINE: the memories, even the thoughts flow from one to the other.
THREE OF NINE: I can't love or hate or laugh.
ALL: Or cry without sharing it with them.
TWO OF NINE: How can any of us take a name for
ALL: For ourselves?
FOUR OF NINE: We're not individuals.
THREE OF NINE: We're not Borg.
TWO OF NINE: We're nothing.
SEVEN: Begin the memory cascade.

[Ready room]

JANEWAY: A friendly game.
PARIS: Well That's how it started.
JANEWAY: I see. Perhaps you could explain to me how this friendly game
turned into a street brawl?
PARIS: Well, Harry and I wanted to explore the station. Er, we wanted to
broaden our understanding of alien cultures and, er
JANEWAY: Skip the recruiting speech. You were looking for a bar. Then
what?
KIM: Well, we found one, and we met a pair of Kinbori who told us about
this game they play with these big, odd-looking rackets.
JANEWAY: You mean one of those?
BOTH: Yeah!
PARIS: In any case, they challenged us to a game and we accepted but I
guess we weren't quite aware of all the rules.
JANEWAY: Because you'd been drinking.
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. You see, we thought it was a version of tennis, but as
soon as we hit the first volley this Kinbori jumps over the net and
starts attacking us with his racket.
KIM: So we figured we were supposed to fight back.
PARIS: Yeah.
KIM: And then, er, well, things got a little out of hand.
JANEWAY: A little out of hand. Seven Voyager crewmen, including two
bridge officers, along with thirteen Kinbori and one Morphinian cafe
owner, all arrested. The charges range from disorderly conduct to assault
on a security officer.
KIM: Yeah, but that last one's not true.
JANEWAY: Thank you, mister Kim. I'll note that exception in my log.
You're both confined to quarters until further notice, after you report
to Sickbay. That's all. Well, did you win?
PARIS: Oh, yes, Ma'am!
KIM: We kicked their rackets.
JANEWAY: Good. Dismissed. Any progress?
SEVEN: I've determined that we all have exactly the same gap in our
memories. It seems unlikely that it would be a coincidence.
JANEWAY: So you believe the Collective deliberately wiped your
recollections of the re-assimilation process?
SEVEN: It is the most likely explanation.
JANEWAY: But?
SEVEN: The Collective would not care that four drones remember being
re-assimilated.
JANEWAY: Something must have happened during the process. Something they
wanted to hide from you. Let's look at this from a different perspective.
Why would the Collective lock them into a neural triad in the first place?
SEVEN: I don't know. There is no advantage to having three drones linked
together in this manner.
JANEWAY: They obviously did it for some reason, and I get the feeling
that if we can answer that question, the rest should fall into place. But
I wish we could find a way to close the gaps in your memories.
SEVEN: There is a way.
JANEWAY: I assume there's a reason you didn't mention it before now.
SEVEN: It would involve linking my neural interface to theirs. Together,
we may be able to restore the missing data. However, I would again be
part of a group mind.
JANEWAY: You're not eager to revisit that experience, huh?
SEVEN: There's also the possibility that I could become trapped in the
neural link.
JANEWAY: Turning the triad into a quartet. I won't ask you to take that
kind of risk.
SEVEN: I do feel compelled to help them, but I am uncertain as to the
correct course of action.
JANEWAY: Let me ask you something. Do you think of these people as family?
SEVEN: Is it relevant?
JANEWAY: There's an old saying. Blood is thicker than water. It means
that the ties of family run deeper than any other kind of relationship.
We'll often do things for members of our family we'd never dream of doing
for anyone else.

[Corridor]

NAOMI: Seven. Seven!
SEVEN: Naomi Wildman.
NAOMI: I heard about the drones. Did they hurt you?
SEVEN: I am not damaged.
NAOMI: What do they want?
SEVEN: They are seeking information from me but I'm uncertain whether I
can help them.
NAOMI: Oh. Be careful.
SEVEN: Naomi Wildman, do you consider me to be family?
NAOMI: I, I don't, I mean, yes. Is that okay?
SEVEN: I have no objection.
NAOMI: Do you think of me as family?
SEVEN: Yes.

Captain's Log, supplemental. Seven of Nine has decided to undergo the
procedure that will link her mind with the other drones. Despite the risk
involved she feels an obligation to help these distant cousins.

[Cargo Bay two]

EMH: I'll be monitoring your neural readings while you're in the link,
but I'm not certain I'll be able to counter the effects if you become
trapped.
SEVEN: I know you'll do your best.
EMH: It's never a good sign when the patient feels the need to comfort
the Doctor. Good luck.
SEVEN: Ready?
TWO OF NINE: Ready.
FOUR OF NINE: Ready.
THREE OF NINE: Ready.

[Planet surface - swamp]

SEVEN: You are damaged. I will assist you. Don't worry. Everything will
be all right.

[Planet surface - campfire]

FOUR OF NINE: The Collective has located us. A Borg vessel is on its way.
SEVEN: We'll be one with the Borg again.
TWO OF NINE: No! I do not want to rejoin the Collective.
FOUR OF NINE: Agreed.
SEVEN: That is in violation of all established protocols.
THREE OF NINE: Forget the protocols. You're not a drone, you're a person
like us.
FOUR OF NINE: You have a name, a life. All you have to do is embrace who
you really are.
SEVEN: No. I do not exist. I am only part of the greater whole.
TWO OF NINE: That's what they want you to believe. That's what they want
us all to believe.
SEVEN: We are Borg. Our primary function is to serve the Collective.
TWO OF NINE: Not anymore.
SEVEN: Error. Input failure!
TWO OF NINE: They know what planet we're on, but without the beacon it'll
be far more difficult to locate us.
THREE OF NINE: If we can remodulate our cortical implants we might be
able to elude their sensors.
TWO OF NINE: We must leave this place.
SEVEN: This discussion is in violation of all established protocols.
THREE OF NINE: You stay here and be reassimilated if you want to. I won't.

[Planet surface - swamp]

FOUR OF NINE: What are you doing?
SEVEN: The nanoprobes will create new interlink nodes in your left
hemisphere. Resistance is futile.

THREE OF NINE: I will not comply. I will not comply.
SEVEN: State your designations.
TWO OF NINE: Two of Nine. Primary adjunct of unimatrix zero one.
THREE OF NINE: Three of Nine. Auxiliary processor of unimatrix zero one.
FOUR OF NINE: Four of Nine. Secondary adjunct of unimatrix zero one.
SEVEN: What is your primary function?
ALL: To serve the Collective.
SEVEN: You will repair the communications beacon.

[Cargo Bay two]

TWO OF NINE: It was you. You were responsible. What have you done to us?
THREE OF NINE: You linked us together.
FOUR OF NINE: You're responsible for our suffering.
THREE OF NINE: How could you do it?
TWO OF NINE: If you didn't want to return to the Collective.
THREE OF NINE: You didn't have to.
SEVEN: You don't understand what happened. Somebody help me!
TUVOK: What's happening?
EMH: Somehow they broke their link with Seven. They're malfunctioning.
Help me get them to Sickbay.

[Sickbay]

EMH: When they broke their connection with you, it must have overloaded
their cortical implants. They went into neural shock.
SEVEN: And yet I was undamaged.
EMH: I think I know why. You said you remembered injecting them with
nanoprobes eight years ago.
SEVEN: Yes. It created an interlink between them. It was the only way to
prevent them from escaping the Collective.
EMH: Well, it seems to have had an unfortunate side effect. Their higher
brain functions were somehow tied into the interlink. When they broke
their connection with you in the Cargo Bay, the shock to their cognitive
systems was too great.
SEVEN: Can you revive them?
EMH: I could remove the microcortical implants. That would break the link
binding them together, but it would also kill them. They'd only live a
matter of weeks. A month at the most.
SEVEN: What are the other options?
EMH: They could be returned to the Borg. If they were re-assimilated into
the Collective they would regain consciousness, and then live out a
normal life span.
SEVEN: As drones.
EMH: As drones. But they'd be alive, Seven.

[Astrometrics lab]

SEVEN: They have no hope of surviving unless they return to the
Collective.
CHAKOTAY: Not exactly a happy ending, is it.
SEVEN: No.
CHAKOTAY: Back on that planet, why do you think you reacted so
differently from the rest of them? Why were you so afraid of becoming an
individual?
SEVEN: When I was first assimilated into the Collective I was a child.
They were assimilated as adults. When our individual memories began to
resurface.
CHAKOTAY: Yours were of being a little girl. A scared little girl.
SEVEN: I let that fear control me. After I saw the drone die in the swamp
I panicked. I began to envision my own death. Alone, without even the
sound of another drone to comfort me. So I forced them to return. I
infiltrated their left cerebral hemispheres with nanoprobes and created a
new interlink network. One that they couldn't resist. Then I eliminated
the evidence of what I'd done.
CHAKOTAY: You were overwhelmed by feelings you couldn't begin to
understand. You're not responsible for that.
SEVEN: Because of what I did, they'll be forced to live the rest of their
lives in the Collective. For that, I am responsible.
CHAKOTAY: There's a difference between surviving and living. They'll
survive in the Collective, but they won't really be alive. You know that
better than any of us.
SEVEN: There is no alternative.
CHAKOTAY: How long would they survive if the Doctor deactivated this
interlink network you created?
SEVEN: A month at most.
CHAKOTAY: A month as an individual or a lifetime as a drone. Which option
would you choose?

[Sickbay]

SEVEN: Survival is insufficient.
EMH: I beg your pardon?
SEVEN: Eight years ago, I forced them to return to the Collective. I
won't make the same mistake again. They deserve to exist as individuals.
We must terminate the link between them.
EMH: I understand that you feel a certain responsibility for these
patients, but as their physician, so do I. It's my duty to preserve their
lives for as long as possible, even if that means
SEVEN: I will not return them to the Borg.
EMH: Are you thinking of what's best for them, or for you?
SEVEN: Clarify.
EMH: You said it yourself. You made a mistake, and Seven of Nine doesn't
like to make mistakes. She strives for perfection. I want you to think
about the motivation behind your decision. Are you doing what's right for
those three people, or are you trying to alleviate the guilt you feel
over what happened eight years ago.
SEVEN: The damage I did can never be repaired, and my guilt is
irrelevant. I simply want them to experience individuality. As I have. As
you have. At one time, you were confined to this Sickbay. Your programme
was limited to emergency medical protocols. In some ways, you were not
unlike a drone. But you were granted the opportunity to explore your
individuality. You were allowed to expand your programme. Your mobile
emitter gives you freedom of movement. Your thoughts are your own. If you
were told you had to become a drone again, I believe you would resist.
EMH: Yes, I suppose I would.
SEVEN: They would resist as well. They would choose freedom, no matter
how fleeting. Only you and I can truly understand that.
EMH: Survival is insufficient.

[Mess hall]

THREE OF NINE: It's so quiet.
FOUR OF NINE: I had no idea you were going to say that. I don't know what
either of you is thinking.
TWO OF NINE: I'd forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own
thoughts. I'm leaving.
THREE OF NINE: Where will you go?
TWO OF NINE: I want to see the space station, to meet new people. To fill
my life with life again, in the time I have left.
FOUR OF NINE: I'm leaving as well. There's an uninhabited planet only a
few light-years from here. I'd like to spend my final days in the open
air.
FOUR OF NINE: I'm leaving as well. There's an uninhabited planet a few
light years from here. I'd like to spend my final days in the open air.
My people don't believe in holding grudges. I wish you well, Seven of
Nine.
SEVEN: Thank you.
THREE OF NINE: It's nice to be on a Federation Starship again. I'd like
to stay aboard Voyager.
SEVEN: The Captain said you may stay as long as you wish.
THREE OF NINE: You mean as long as I have. I can't forgive you for what
you did to us, but I do understand why you did it.

[Astrometrics lab]

SEVEN: Naomi Wildman.
NAOMI: I thought you might like some company.
SEVEN: Why?
NAOMI: Because of what happened with the drones.
SEVEN: I see that word travels quickly.
NAOMI: It's a small ship. I thought maybe you might want to spend some
time with family.
