	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	moving toward a brilliant sun. Even from here the
	TURBULENCE on the surface of the sun is evident.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			All hands, this is the captain.
			The sun in the Delos system is
			undergoing large-scale magnetic
			field changes, producing violent,
			gigantic flares.

2    INT. ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS SHOTS

	in corridors, Engineering, and so on as the ship's
	company listens to their captain.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
				(continuing)
			We will be studying this star
			at close range. Even though we
			will be running with full
			deflectors, the closeness of the
			event and its severity are going
			to create problems.

3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	The bridge is manned as usual. WESLEY is at the Aft
	Science Station.

					PICARD
			Intense magnetic fields have a
			disruptive effect on electrical
			systems. We can therefore expect
			an interruption of communications,
			and potential temporary loss of
			other systems. As a precaution,
			we are now going to Yellow
			Alert...

	He signals Tasha with a nod of his head and she
	ACTIVATES the system.
STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - TEASER          2.

3    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Stay sharp, everyone.

4    OMITTED

5    INT. MAIN ENGINEERING

	As technicians keep close watch on their stations.

					DATA'S COM VOICE
			Engineering, this is Ops. Bring
			all systems on line and direct
			full power to the shields.

	The technicians carry out Data's order.

6    INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Picard takes his seat.

					DATA
			All sections secure.

					PICARD
			Lieutenant La Forge?

					GEORDI
			Course set.

					PICARD
			Half impulse.

					GEORDI
			Half impulse, aye.

7    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	as it MOVES PAST CAMERA toward the dazzling sun.

8    INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Everyone is intent:

					PICARD
			On Main Viewer.

          STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - TEASER          3.

9    SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The great sun FILLS THE SCREEN WITH LIGHT. WE CAN
	SEE no definition -- only intensity.

					PICARD
			Mask out the photosphere.

	While we watch, the intensity of the sun itself is
	MATTED OUT, LEAVING ONLY THE RIM which is erupting.

					PICARD
			Magnify. Quadrant one-seven,
			sector four-zero-three.

	And now WE can clearly SEE on the surface. Great,
	powerful FLARES extend out above the rim.

10   REACTIONS

	As they watch the wondrous eruptions on the surface
	of the sun.

					RIKER
			I've never seen anything like
			this before. The violence of
			these eruptions is awesome.

					PICARD
			And humbling, Number One.

					DATA
			Reading an unusual number of
			sunspots and eruptive prominences,
			sir. The magnetic field is
			extremely irregular.

11   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	as it moves in closer to the Delos sun.

12   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Wesley makes an adjustment at his Science Station.

					WESLEY
			Captain, deflectors are being hit
			by a huge burst of X-rays.

          STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - TEASER          4.

12   CONTINUED:

	And all at once, Wesley's console is BATHED WITH A BLUE
	AURORA; we HEAR STATIC SOUNDS. Wesley pulls back, more
	delighted than alarmed.

					WESLEY
				(continuing)
			Wow -- look!
				(getting professional)
			Sir, my console seems to be
			overloading.

					WORF
			The X-ray burst is disrupting
			systems, Captain. I'm adjusting
			deflectors to compensate.

13   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING

	They are also having difficulty. The intensity of the
	radiation is affecting control systems.

					WORF'S COM VOICE
			Increase power to forward deflectors.

14   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	The AURORA EFFECT on the Science Station DIES OUT.

					PICARD
			Status report.

					WORF
			All systems operational, sir.

					TROI
			Captain. The level of tension
			on the ship is mounting.

					PICARD
			Understandable. Data?

					DATA
			If we are to investigate this
			unusual solar activity -- we must
			get closer.

	Picard thinks for just a beat.

          STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - TEASER          5.

14   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Mister La Forge, move us closer.

	Picard studies the viewscreen.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			We'll be pushing our deflectors
			to the limit, but we'll get a good
			look at this phenomenon.

					WORF
			Captain, I have intercepted what
			seems to be a distress signal.

	Everyone's attention turns to this new emergency.

					PICARD
			Let me hear it.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			This... (garbled) -- this is
			... (garbled) -- on the freighter
			Sanction... (garbled) ... and
			unable to... (garbled) .... Need
			help.

					DATA
			The transmission is from a
			freighter in orbit around the
			fourth planet of the system.
			However, the receiving station
			is on the third planet.

					PICARD
			Open hailing frequency.

					TASHA
			Hailing frequencies open.

					PICARD
			Unidentified freighter, this is
			the USS Enterprise. May we be
			of assistance?

	On the viewscreen the IMAGE IS CLUTTERED WITH STATIC.

					T'JON (V.O)
				(a garbled response)
			Whoever you are, YES!
			(garbled) .... cannot maintain...
			(garbled) ... if you can help...

	Picard listening.

          STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - TEASER          6.

14   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Can't you enhance the image?

					TASHA
			Too much interference.

					PICARD
			Set a course to intersect with
			the freighter. Warp two.

					GEORDI
			Aye, sir.

					PICARD
			Maintain Yellow Alert.

					T'JON (V.O.)
			Can't control... (garbled) ... ship
			is losing orbit... (garbled) ...
			heading into atmosphere...
			without help, we'll burn up.

	As Picard and Riker exchange a concerned glance:

15   OMITTED

									FADE OUT.

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

16   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	coming out of warp.

17   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Everyone is alert.

					WORF
			It is a freighter -- very old.

					DATA
			Captain, our sensors are being
			severely affected by the sun
			flares.

					PICARD
			Helm -- get us in as close as
			possible to the freighter's
			orbit.

					GEORDI
			Aye, sir.

					DATA
			There are six life forms aboard
			the freighter.

					WORF
			Captain, the freighter's orbit
			is decaying.

					PICARD
			How long until it loses integrity?

					WORF
			A matter of minutes.

					PICARD
				(he touches his
				 arm-panel)
			Unidentified freighter, this is
			the USS Enterprise.

	There is a moment of hesitation where all that is heard
	is STATIC, then:

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         8.

17   CONTINUED:

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Enterprise, this is the Aurelian
			freighter... Sanction.

					PICARD
			Put this on the Main Viewer.

18   MAIN VIEWER - (OPTICAL)

	The Screen is a clutter of LINES and SWIRLS.

					TASHA
			The visual transmission is still
			breaking up.

	The viewscreen REPAINTS WITH THE FREIGHTER IN ORBIT.

					PICARD
			Freighter, this is the Enterprise.
			What is your situation?

					T'JON (V.O.)
			... (garbled) ... We are...

	Several OTHER VOICES call out:

					SOBI (V.O.)
			Get us off here.

					LANGOR (V.O.)
				(female)
			Please -- help us.

	These desperate pleas are mixed with the OTHER VOICES
	and added to the STATIC making this transmission
	unintelligible.

					PICARD
			This is the Enterprise -- with
			all this interference it is
			difficult to copy your
			transmission -- if you all talk
			at once... it is impossible. Now
			-- please -- say again. What is
			your situation?

	Again there is a lot of STATIC -- then some shouting
	in the background and finally ONE MALE VOICE.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			I am T'Jon -- the captain of the
			Sanction.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         9.

18   CONTINUED:

	Picard is pleased that T'Jon's voice is calm and under
	control.

					PICARD
				(to himself)
			At last.
				(to T'Jon)
			How can we help?

	There are raised VOICES SHOUTING to get them off. Then
	T'Jon again restores order.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			We have lost -- I don't know...
			something -- and I am no longer
			able to maintain this orbit, nor
			am I able to use main thrusters.
			Everything's just kind of... you
			know... dead, I guess. It's
			all... you know... shut down.

					PICARD
			That's very vague. What's the
			computer analysis?

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			The computer's not working very
			well.

					PICARD
			Data... can you tap into their
			computer and clarify the
			situation?

					DATA
			I will attempt it.

					TASHA
			Captain, the tractor beam is
			available, if you want it.

					RIKER
			At least we can pull them out of
			orbit before they enter the
			atmosphere.

					PICARD
			Yes. Captain T'Jon -- we are
			going to lock on our tractor beam
			and pull you out of orbit.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Hey -- that's great.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         10.

18   CONTINUED:

	In the background there are two excited VOICES to
	counterpoint T'Jon's matter of fact response.

19   ANGLE ON TASHA

	as she enters the information to set and lock the
	tractor beams.

20   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND FREIGHTER (OPTICAL)

	as the TRACTOR BEAM reaches out. It's TORN AND
	RAGGEDY.

21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Tasha re-enters the information. Her panel indicates
	a malfunction.

					TASHA
			The solar flares are interfering
			with the tractor beam, Captain.
			I am unable to lock on.

					WORF
			Captain, the freighter's orbit
			continues to deteriorate.

					PICARD
			Captain T'Jon, we are unable to
			attach our tractor beam because
			of the intense solar activity.

					T'JON (V.O.)
				(calmly)
			I understand.
				(giving up)
			Thanks for trying.

	Again in the background there are panicky CRIES.

					DATA
			Captain, I have determined what
			is malfunctioning on the
			freighter.

					PICARD
			Enterprise to Sanction. We have
			analyzed your problem.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Great.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         11.

21   CONTINUED:

	Picard gestures to Data to go ahead.

					DATA
			Your ship's design uses an
			electromagnetic coil to constrict
			the exhaust flow. That coil is
			misaligned.

					PICARD
			Have you the necessary tools to
			realign the coil?

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			I don't think so.

					DATA
			Captain, I believe we can provide
			the freighter with a temporary
			substitute. Ship's stores contain
			a coil of the proper type.

					RIKER
				(to Tasha)
			Can we beam it over?

					TASHA
			Yes.

					PICARD
			Captain T'Jon, we will beam over
			a replacement coil.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			That's great... and that will fix
			us up?

					PICARD
			Well, once it's installed.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Right.
				(a beat)
			... And how do we do that?

	Picard is dumbfounded. He glances over at Riker. Both
	men are amazed.

					PICARD
			What's the matter with these
			people? How can he be the captain
			of the vessel and be ignorant of
			its simplest functions?

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         12.

21   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			If this weren't so serious it
			would make you laugh.

					PICARD
			Captain T'Jon -- how long have
			you been in command of the
			freighter?

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Seven years. This is my
			twenty-sixth voyage to Brekka.

					PICARD
			And you don't know how to align
			a control coil?

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			It's never come up.

					RIKER
			Is there anyone on board who can
			do it?

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Hold on a minute... I'll ask.

	There is a pause.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
				(continuing)
			Sorry -- nobody here knows
			anything about it.

					RIKER
			I'll beam over with a team.

					TASHA
			Captain -- I strongly recommend
			against anyone from this ship
			beaming over. The solar
			interference is too great.

					WORF
			The freighter has entered the
			planet's atmosphere.
			Disintegration is imminent.

					RIKER
			We are running out of options.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         13.

21   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
				(nods to Tasha and
				 Riker)
			Let's get them off there.

	Riker and Tasha are on their feet and heading for the
	turbolift.

					PICARD
			Captain T'Jon. Prepare to beam
			over.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			If you think that's best.

	Picard is getting more than a little impatient with
	T'Jon and his lack of concern.

					PICARD
			Unless you have another option
			-- yes, I "think that's best."

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
				(amiable)
			Whatever you say.

	Off Picard's REACTION.

22   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Riker and Tasha ENTER. Tasha goes directly to the
	console, takes over from a Transporter Chief, and
	begins trying to lock on to the life forms on the
	freighter.

					TASHA
			I can't maintain a positive lock.

23   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Wesley checks a readout.

					WESLEY
			An unusual E-M burst. Readings
			off scale.

	Another AURORA EFFECT, this time on Propulsion
	Station.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         14.

24   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Riker and Tasha are working together.

					RIKER
			Freighter Sanction, this is the
			Enterprise. We are having
			difficulty getting a fix.

					TASHA
				(to Riker)
			Have them go to their own
			Transporter Room. It will be
			tricky, but perhaps I can link
			the two transporters in series
			and get them over with the
			increased power.

					RIKER
			It's worth a try.
				(to intercom)
			Captain T'Jon -- go immediately
			to your Transporter Room.
			Contact me from there.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
				(still very calm)
			Right, Enterprise -- we'll call
			you from there... but, if you
			can't get us with your
			transporter, what makes you think
			ours will do the job?

					TASHA
			I'm going to interconnect them.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			I didn't know you could do that.

					TASHA
			Hurry -- we're running out of
			time.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			We're on the way.

	Tasha shoots a look at Riker.

					TASHA
			I don't think they're going to
			make it.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         15.

24   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Captain T'Jon doesn't seem to
			care one way or the other.

					TASHA
				(touches the com)
			Worf -- how much time do we have?

					WORF'S COM VOICE
			One minute, twenty-eight seconds.

	Tasha taps the console.

					TASHA
			Captain T'Jon -- are you there?

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Yeah. We're in the transporter
			room.

					TASHA
			Great. Activate your transporter.
			Set coordinates nine -- seven --
			zero -- three... mark two...
			six... eight.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Did you say... two -- eight --
			six... or eight -- eight -- six.

					TASHA
				(frustrated almost to
				 the point of anger)
			TWO -- SIX -- EIGHT.

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			Got it.

25   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

26   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Riker touches his communicator.

					RIKER
			We are establishing the link now.

	There is a pause, then:

					T'JON'S COM VOICE
			We are ready.

	Tasha at the console.

					TASHA
			Then all six of you get on the
			transporter platform -- on my
			signal, energize.

	She exchanges a look of exasperation with Riker.

					TASHA
				(continuing; to Riker)
			I've got their initial transporter
			signal. Interlock complete.
				(intercom)
			Energize on my mark. Four --
			three -- two -- one -- energize.

27   TRANSPORT PLATFORM (OPTICAL)

	As the MATERIALIZATION BEGINS -- AND FADES OUT -- AND
	BEGINS AGAIN.

28   ANGLE ON TASHA

	working the console.

29   TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)

	What MATERIALIZES is not the people -- but a large
	cargo barrel.

30   ANGLE ON RIKER AND TASHA

	Both very surprised.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Did you get them off?

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE         17.

30   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			No. They stayed on the freighter
			-- and sent their cargo.

31   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Picard is astounded.

					PICARD
			Cargo!? Are those people crazy?
				(a beat)
			What could possibly be that
			important?

					WORF
			Sir -- the freighter is
			disintegrating.

	Off Picard's REACTION.

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

32   EXT. SPACE - THE FREIGHTER (OPTICAL)

	The Ornaran freighter drifts further away toward the
	planet Brekka.

33   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Manned as before. Picard can't believe his ears.

					GEORDI
			Captain, the freighter is entering
			the atmosphere. Her hull
			temperature is building.

					PICARD
			Number One -- I don't understand
			these people. Their lives are
			in danger and they're sending over
			cargo?

34   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	The barrel sits innocently on the transporter pad.
	Riker and Tasha are astounded.

					RIKER
			Unbelievable.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			We're losing the freighter.
			You've got to beam those people
			over now.

					RIKER
				(to Tasha)
			Clear that cargo. Beam it to a
			hold.

					TASHA
			Aye, sir.

	Tasha hits a control. The barrel DEMATERIALIZES.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         19.

34   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(to Sanction)
			Freighter Sanction... this is the
			Enterprise, get on the transporter
			pad and...
				(to Tasha)
			Forget it. Just lock on to any
			life forms you can find and get
			them over.

					TASHA
			Trying, sir.

35   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	as Geordi checks a readout.

					GEORDI
			The freighter is going down.

36   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Tasha feverishly works the controls.

			Reading six life forms...
				(shakes her head)
			But I can't get a solid lock.

					RIKER
			We've no choice. Energize.

37   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	as the MATERIALIZATION EFFECT starts on the pad, then
	FADES. Tasha fights the controls, trying to bring in
	the signal. Finally, FOUR HUMANOIDS MATERIALIZE on
	the pad.

					RIKER
			You said SIX - where are...
				(fearing the worst)
			... the other two?

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         20.

37   CONTINUED:

					TASHA
				(shakes her head)
			The lock didn't hold, sir.

					RIKER
			Re-establish.

					TASHA
			It's too late.

37A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	On the viewscreen, the freighter Sanction HITS THE
	ATMOSPHERE.

38   ANGLE ON PICARD

					PICARD
			Number One!?

39   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	as the BEAM IN BECOMES COMPLETE. Riker and Tasha
	look over the new arrivals.

					RIKER
			Two are lost, sir. But we saved
			four.

	On the transporter pad are the four humanoids: T'JON,
	ROMAS, and SOBI (three males) as well as LANGOR (a
	female). They are instantly divided into pairs -
	because of the physical differences, clothing and
	manner.

	T'Jon and Romas, of the planet Ornara, are scruffy,
	unclean, and almost wild in appearance. Their manner
	is nervous, belligerent, somewhat high-strung. In
	contrast, Sobi and Langor, of the planet Brekka, are
	attractive, well-dressed, well-groomed, intelligent,
	and genteel.

	Riker STEPS FORWARD.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         21.

39   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			I am Commander William Riker of
			the USS Enterprise.
				(solemnly)
			I'm sorry. We were unable to
			rescue the other two.

	The four aliens REACT with indifference.

					RIKER
			Were they with you...
				(then indicating the
				 other pair)
			... or with you?

	Something else is on their minds.

					T'JON
				(nearly frantic)
			With us.

					RIKER
			We did everything we could, if
			you had come instead of the cargo,
			you could have all made it.

	T'Jon looks around - near panic.

					T'JON
			The cargo... Where is it?

					ROMAS
				(also panicking)
			You did save it, didn't you?

					RIKER
				(mystified)
			Yes, we did. It's in one of our
			cargo holds. You act like it's
			more important than your comrades.

	Judging by their reactions, Riker's right.

					T'JON
			May we see it?

39A  INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)

	The alien cargo is in the cargo bay. The DOORS OPEN
	and Riker, Tasha, T'Jon, Romas, Sobi, and Langor ENTER.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         22.

39A  CONTINUED:

	As they catch sight of the cargo, Sobi and Langor are
	gratified; T'Jon and Romas are ecstatic.

					T'JON
			Thank you. It's just we thought
			we had lost it.

					SOBI
				(casually)
			Careful with your choice of words,
			T'Jon. It's ours, not yours.

					T'JON
				(heating up)
			We paid a fair price for it!

					LANGOR
			You offered a fair price, but we
			have not received it.

					ROMAS
			You accepted our goods in trade!

					SOBI
			Then where are they? Tell me!

					T'JON
			That's not our problem!

					LANGOR
			No more than the barrel is your
			property. It's as simple as this.
			The goods were never delivered;
			they were destroyed with your
			ship.

					SOBI
			Hence the deal was incomplete;
			hence possession of the Felicium
			remains ours!

					ROMAS
				(a plea)
			We need it.

					SOBI
				(to Riker)
			Commander, I request you transport
			my associate --
				(nods to Langor)
			-- and myself down to our planet,
			with our merchandise.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         23.

39A  CONTINUED: (2)

					T'JON
			Yes, get them out of here! But
			the barrel stays.

					LANGOR
				(to Sobi)
			There's no reasoning with you.

					SOBI
				(to her)
			Langor, you expect too much from
			them. You always have and you
			are always disappointed.
				(then to T'Jon with a
				 hard edge)
			You didn't pay -- so it's not
			yours.

					T'JON
			Damn you, Sobi --

	T'Jon grabs Sobi's arm -- and there is a FLASH OF
	SPARKS as the bodies touch. Sobi grimaces in pain,
	grabs back at T'Jon. Another FLASH OF SPARKS, this
	time hurting T'Jon.

					TASHA
				(drawing her phaser)
			Stop this! Now!

40   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	as a free-for-all continues. Sobi and T'Jon grapple,
	and we HEAR SPARKING NOISES as their electrical fields
	try to cancel each other out. Romas tries to rush to
	T'Jon's aid; Langor grabs Romas's arm. More SPARKS.
	Riker touches a com panel:

					RIKER
			Security to Cargo Bay Eleven!

	Tasha makes and adjustment on her phaser and fires.
	T'Jon and Sobi are SLIGHTLY stunned by the blast.

					TASHA
			Behave yourselves, Gentlemen.

	They both "brush themselves off," shoot each other
	hostile looks, but the physical part of their dispute
	is, for the moment, resolved.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         24.

40   CONTINUED:

	Security Personnel ENTER, phasers drawn.

					TASHA
				(re the aliens)
			Escort our "visitors" to the
			Observation Lounge.

	The visitors LEAVE.

					TASHA
				(eyeing the aliens)
			A natural electrical charge... ?

					RIKER
			Formidable.

					TASHA
			Yes, and a difficult weapon to
			confiscate.

41   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	Sobi and Langor are seated at one side of a table,
	glaring sullenly at T'Jon and Romas who are sitting
	opposite them. Two security personnel are standing
	a few feet away. T'Jon and Romas are changing -- they
	are becoming slightly more frantic; their condition
	will continue to deteriorate.

					T'JON
			We have to resolve this. There
			isn't much time.

					SOBI
			What can you offer?

					T'JON
			Everything we had went down with
			the Sanction.

					SOBI
			Then it is going to be difficult
			to accommodate you.

42   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data, Troi.

			Maintain.
				(to Riker)
			And our rather combative guests,
			Number One?

					RIKER
			Waiting for you in the
			Observation Lounge, sir.

					PICARD
			Data, what can you tell me about
			the inhabitants of this system?

					DATA
			Not very much, sir. The only
			recorded contact with the Delos
			system was over two hundred years
			ago. A scout ship reported two
			inhabited planets, both
			technologically just on the edge
			of acquiring space travel.

					GEORDI
			Odd that in two centuries, neither
			civilization advanced further.

					TROI
			Sir, I find it strange that none
			of our visitors feel much remorse
			about the two freighter passengers
			who perished... yet their barrel
			of cargo is a source of great
			anxiety to them.

					PICARD
			Yes, let us pay a call and get
			some answers. Counselor, Number
			One, Mister Data...

	Riker, Picard, Data, and Troi EXIT into the Observation
	Lounge.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         26.

43   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	As before. Riker, Picard, Troi, and Data ENTER. Riker
	performs introductions:

					RIKER
			Captain, may I present Sobi and
			Langor from the planet Brekka,
			which we are now orbiting. And
			T'Jon and Romas... from the
			neighboring planet, Ornara.

					PICARD
			I am sorry we could not save your
			ship.

					T'JON
			You could have repaired it.

					PICARD
			Yes.

					T'JON
			We have only two left. Neither
			works. They are critical to our
			survival. Could you fix them?

					PICARD
			Mister Data?

					DATA
			Our computer downloaded the
			specifications for the magnetic
			coils the freighters depend on,
			sir. Assuming the malfunction
			is similar... suitable
			replacements can be fabricated.

	All the visitors are relieved. It's the first time
	they have had similar reactions to an event.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			Instruct Engineering to proceed.

					DATA
			Aye, sir.

					T'JON
			Now, as for our cargo...

					SOBI
			Our cargo, Captain.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         27.

43   CONTINUED:

					ROMAS
			Wrong, Sobi --

	Picard jumps in to forestall the argument.

					PICARD
			My first officer has said
			ownership of the cargo is in
			dispute. This is a question which
			must be settled by whatever legal
			mechanisms exist between your
			societies.

					T'JON
			Captain Picard, you don't
			understand. This is a matter of
			life and death.

					PICARD
			Why is that? What is the cargo?

					T'JON
			Medicine.

					PICARD
			Indeed.

					ROMAS
			Our home planet is in desperate
			need, Captain. Ornara suffers
			from a lethal plague.

					T'JON
			The cargo you have impounded
			represents the only hope of life
			for our people.

	Picard turns to Sobi and Langor.

					PICARD
			Is that right?

					SOBI
			Yes.

					LANGOR
			You must think us heartless
			brutes, Captain, but look at our
			side of it. The plant which
			yields the medicine Felicium grows
			only in remote areas of our home
			planet Brekka.

         STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO         28.

43   CONTINUED: (2)

					SOBI
			It must be painstakingly
			cultivated, harvested, and
			purified... a complex and
			expensive process.

					LANGOR
			That single shipment of Felicium
			represents an enormous investment.
			We can't just give it away!

					T'JON
			We paid for it.
				(to Picard)
			We are asking only for what is
			ours.

					LANGOR
			That is your viewpoint. Ours,
			of course, differs.

					ROMAS
			You are going to hold to that
			position.

	Sobi spreads his hands helplessly.

					SOBI
			I am constrained to abide by the
			terms of our agreement.

					ROMAS
				(with quiet intensity)
			Then you condemn us to death!

	T'Jon tries to calm his companion:

					T'JON
			Romas --

					ROMAS
				(to Sobi and Langor)
			You disgust me! If you saw the
			suffering the plague has brought,
			would you still be so heartless?

	He makes a small gesture.

43   CONTINUED: (3)

					ROMAS
				(continuing)
			We are going to get to find out,
			when you see what the plague does
			to us.

	Picard is stunned.

					PICARD
			Romas -- you and T'Jon carry the
			disease?

					ROMAS
				(bitterly)
			Yes. Every Ornaran does.

					PICARD
			Then you may have brought it
			aboard my ship!
				(to Riker)
			Was there a medical scan during
			transport?

					RIKER
			Unverified -- the solar flares may
			have caused a malfunction in the
			biofilters --

	An alarmed Picard doesn't wait for the rest. He slaps
	a com panel.

					PICARD
			Red Alert! Medical emergency --

	On the concerned expressions of our bridge crew, WE:

45   INT. SICKBAY

	With a security team guarding the doorway, Beverly
	scans the four visitors. The Brekkians, Sobi and
	Langor, seem perfectly healthy. They are relaxed and
	smiling.

					SOBI
			You find us well, I trust?

					BEVERLY
			As far as I can tell. Your

			but I detect no dangerous virus
			or bacteria.

					LANGOR
			I assure you we are in perfect

	Beverly moves over to examine the Ornarans. In
	contrast to the Brekkians, T'Jon and Romas look quite
	sickly -- they are both antsy and sweaty.

					T'JON
				(impatient)
			We're not! We need our medicine.

					SOBI
				(correcting)
			Our medicine.

					T'JON
			We paid for it -- it's ours now!

					BEVERLY
			Enough!

	The visitors glare at each other.

45   CONTINUED:

					SOBI
				(smiling)
			Of course you are right, Doctor.
			Could we leave now?

					BEVERLY
			I see no reason why not.
				(to the security guard)
			Escort them to their quarters.

	Picard ENTERS. Beverly leaves her four "patients" and
	goes to her office. The visitors all look
	apprehensive. Each realizes that Captain Picard holds
	their future in his hands.

					LANGOR
			Captain, could I talk with you
			please... in private.

					PICARD
			Not right now.

	And he FOLLOWS Beverly INTO her office.

45A  INT. DR. CRUSHER'S OFFICE

	Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him.

					PICARD
			What have you learned?

					BEVERLY
			The Brekkians are free of
			infection. The Ornarans have all
			the symptoms of a disease -- but
			I can't find a cause.

					PICARD
			Perhaps the transporter filtered
			it out when they were beamed
			aboard?

					BEVERLY
				(shaking her head)
			There's no record of it. Then
			again, the solar flare activity
			may have caused a transporter
			malfunction.

					PICARD
			Are they going to die?

45A  CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			The physiology is somewhat
			different from ours, so I need
			to check further, but... my
			instinct says no.

					PICARD
			Do you think we are in danger from
			this plague?

					BEVERLY
			Again, I don't think so, but I
			need more time to know for sure.

					PICARD
			There are some missing pieces to
			the puzzle, don't you feel that
			too?

					BEVERLY
			What's missing here is a little
			humanity.

	Picard gives her a little look of surprise.

					PICARD
				(lightly)
			Are we losing our professional
			detachment, Doctor?

					BEVERLY
			Perhaps. As Captain, I think you
			should know that I am developing
			a very active dislike of the
			Brekkians.

					PICARD
			Understandable.

	Hold on Beverly as Picard EXITS.

45B  INT. SICKBAY

	Picard STEPS OVER TO the aliens. T'Jon is very nervous
	and anxious.

					T'JON
			Captain, you must give us back
			our cargo.

					PICARD
			I can't do that.

        STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE        33.

45B  CONTINUED:

					T'JON
			Why not? It belongs to us.

					PICARD
			And the Brekkians insist it is

					ROMAS
			They lie!

					PICARD
			Maybe so, but it's not for me to
			decide.

					ROMAS
				(losing his composure)
			We need some now... NOW! I don't
			care if it's your 'decision' or
			not... get us some!

	T'JON silences Romas with a gesture; T'Jon attempts
	to speak calmly.

					T'JON
			Captain, what's happening to us,
			is happening to thousands more
			on Ornara. Please understand the
			magnitude of the problem.

					ROMAS
				(angry)
			Your people don't need it --
				(indicating the
				 Brekkians)
			-- they don't need it... our
			people do!

					T'JON
			If you don't give it to us, you
			will be party to murder... not
			only us, but an entire
			civilization!

	Instantly, T'Jon realizes he's gone too far:

					T'JON
				(continuing)
			Sorry, I did not mean to insult
			you. I'm feeling very shaky.

					ROMAS
			We cannot hold out much longer!

45B  CONTINUED: (2)

	Picard looks to Beverly.

					BEVERLY
			No, Captain -- I think they should
			have it. They believe it will
			help them. That in itself might
			control their symptoms.

	Picard turns back to the Ornarans.

					PICARD
			I'll talk with the Brekkians.

					T'JON
			Thank you, Captain. I appreciate
			anything you can do.

	Picard nods and EXITS.

	Sobi and Langor are relaxing in their quarters. They

					PICARD
			Thank you.

					LANGOR
			And its crew. Everyone is so

				(interrupting)
			Wait. Let the Captain speak.
			We want to be reasonable.

46   CONTINUED:

	Langor's control of the situation does not go unnoticed
	by Picard.

					PICARD
			The Ornarans are quite ill and
			are insistent that they need
			Felicium.

					SOBI
			That is not surprising.

					PICARD
			Then would you object to allowing
			them enough Felicium for their
			immediate needs?

					SOBI
			Captain, we Brekkians are in
			business -- we are not in the
			habit of giving away what has not
			been paid for.

					PICARD
			You would let them die rather than
			share the medicine?

	Sobi and Langor exchange a look.

					LANGOR
			We want to be fair, Captain. We
			agree to permitting them two
			dosages for immediate use.

					SOBI
				(magnanimous)
			No charge.

					PICARD
			I'll have our medical officer
			handle it.

					LANGOR
			I trust you won't mind if we are

47   INT. CARGO BAY

	Picard, Beverly, Data, Sobi, Langor, two science
	officers, and a security team are gathered around the
	barrel of Felicium. Using a strange set of
	contraptions, a minuscule amount of Felicium is
	extracted from the barrel.

					LANGOR
			Point-zero-one milliliters is the
			proper individual dosage.

					PICARD
				(impressed)
			A very potent substance.

					SOBI
			We've perfected our distillation
			process over the years. In my
			grandfather's day, the same amount
			of Felicium would have filled five
			rooms this size, Captain.

					DATA
			No doubt you have applied your
			technology from other industries
			to the refinement of this product.

					SOBI
			We have no other industry.

					PICARD
			None at all?

					LANGOR
			We don't need any. The Ornarans
			provide us everything we need --
			in exchange for this.

					DATA
			Fascinating. Your society
			dedicated exclusively to the
			production of a single product.

					PICARD
			A product for which you have no
			use for, but which the Ornarans
			can't live without.

					LANGOR
			One of the little ironies of life,
			Captain.

        STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE        37.

47   CONTINUED:

					SOBI
			But one we'd be fools not to take
			advantage of. It is mutually
			beneficial.

					LANGOR
			The Ornarans provide us with the
			necessities of life and we provide
			them with the necessities of
			living. It is a fair exchange.

					PICARD
				(interrupting)

			Excuse me... I'll take this to
			Sickbay.

48   INT. SICKBAY

	T'Jon and Romas prepare to dose themselves as Beverly
	watches. Each person on Ornara has a device for
	administering the drug. It's a small cylinder which
	converts the Felicium into something which is then
	injected into the fat part of the hand just below the
	thumb.

					BEVERLY
			Can I help?

					T'Jon
			No.

					ROMAS
				(to his friend)
			Hurry up!

	T'Jon takes the dosage devise (NOTE: it should not look
	like something currently used by doctors or dopers)
	and presses it against Romas hand. Romas immediately
	REACTS. He relaxes -- the tension leaves him -- then
	slowly he smiles.

	T'Jon doses himself. Instantly, his former edginess
	vanishes; a wave of calm comes over him.

					BEVERLY
			You are feeling better?

			Yes. Thank you. I'm fine now.

	T'Jon and Romas are totally blissed out. We HOLD on
	Beverly's look of concern.

			Report, Doctor Crusher.

					BEVERLY
			I may not know Felicium's full

			But I know how to interpret
			physical reactions.

					PICARD
			Are the Ornarans recovering?

					BEVERLY
			Both T'Jon and Romas are fine...
			in fact, too fine.
				(a beat)
			Felicium is a narcotic.

					PICARD
			Then T'Jon, Romas -- indeed every

53   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM

	Data is seated working at a computer screen. Picard
	ENTERS, immediately FOLLOWED BY Riker and Troi.

					RIKER
			It's a fascinating little tale
			we've run into of disease -- rescue
			-- commerce -- and interdependence
			between two worlds.

					PICARD
			You have piqued my interest,
			Number One -- please continue.

					RIKER
			Mister Data.

					DATA
			Beginning several thousand years
			ago, the two worlds took different
			paths. Ornara became technically
			sophisticated, Brekka did not.
			Then two hundred years ago Ornara
			was stricken by a devastating
			plague.

					RIKER
			Their advanced technology could
			offer no solution.

					DATA
			Somehow, and there is limited
			information on this point, the
			cure was found in a plant which
			is indigenous to only Brekka, and
			which resisted all attempts at
			cultivation on Ornara.

        STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR        40.

53   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			In any case a trading situation
			quickly developed, which still
			exists.

					DATA
			The Ornarans acquire the Felicium
			from the Brekkians, and in
			exchange, the Ornarans provide
			the Brekkians with foods and
			staples.

					BEVERLY (O.S.)
			A nice arrangement for the
			Brekkians.

					RIKER
			And for the Ornarans -- without
			the medicine they would all die.

	Beverly JOINS the others. She has her diagnostic
	device in her hand.

					BEVERLY
			No they wouldn't. Captain, here
			are the results of my analysis.
			Felicium is definitely a powerful
			and addictive narcotic. What's
			more, despite what the Ornarans
			have been saying, it's not a
			medicine. It was a medicine, and
			it did cure the plague, two
			hundred years ago.

					PICARD
			And they no longer need it.

					BEVERLY
			The plague is irrelevant now: it
			doesn't exist... and it's not
			going to recur.

	Off their REACTIONS.

					PICARD
			The Ornarans have no medical need
			for Felicium.

					BEVERLY
			No, but their physical and
			psychological need is very real.

53   CONTINUED: (2)

	There is a long pause. Everyone slowly looks toward
	Picard, and for a beat, Picard is pensive.

					BEVERLY
			What are you going to do?

					PICARD
			Based on what we know so far...
			there is nothing I can do.

					BEVERLY
			And you don't think drug addiction
			and exploitation is sufficient
			cause?

					PICARD
			This situation has existed for
			a very long time. Those two
			societies are intertwined in a
			symbiotic relationship.

					BEVERLY
			With one society profiting at the
			expense of the other.

					PICARD
			That's how you see it.

					BEVERLY
			I can synthesize a non-addictive
			substitute which will ease their
			withdrawal symptoms.

					PICARD
			No. We can't do that either.

					BEVERLY
			I know this. You can't let them
			have the Felicium.

					PICARD
			Why? Because it goes against our
			moral sensibilities? Our mission
			is not to force Federation or
			Earth values on others in the
			galaxy.

        STAR TREK: "Symbiosis" - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR        42.

53   CONTINUED: (3)

					BEVERLY
			In this case... you're wrong,
			Captain. One hundred percent
			wrong.

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			Captain, I am receiving a call
			from Ornara.

					PICARD
			Patch it in here.

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			The signal's ragged, but I think
			I can put it on the Viewscreen.

	Picard turns the viewscreen so the others in the room
	can see. The SCREEN LIGHTS UP with a less than perfect
	picture of MARGAN.

					MARGAN
			I am Margan. Are my people on
			board your ship?

					PICARD
			Some of them, yes.

					MARGAN
			May I speak with them?

					PICARD
			Yes.
				(touching his com panel)
			Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans
			brought in... no, wait, I don't
			want them to have access to the
			bridge.
				(then, to Margan)
			We will contact you in a few
			minutes.
				(then to Yar)
			I will take this in the guest

	Data joins Wesley at the Aft Science Stations.

53A  CONTINUED:

					WESLEY
				(amazed)
			I can understand how this could
			happen to the Ornarans... What
			I can't understand is why anyone
			would voluntarily become dependent
			upon a chemical.

					DATA
				(checking readouts)
			Yet, the voluntary addiction to
			drugs is a recurrent theme in many
			cultures.

					WESLEY
				(nods)
			As in the twenty-first century...
			when Earth governments used
			narcotics to control the military.

					DATA
			Or look at the twentieth century.
			The dangers of drug abuse were
			well known, yet their use was
			commonplace.

					WESLEY
			Why?

					DATA
			That is what I do not understand.

	Tasha overhears, STEPS UP.

					TASHA
			No one wants to become dependent.
			That happens later.

					WESLEY
			But it does happen. So why do
			people even start?

					TASHA
			Oh, lots of reasons... My home
			planet was a place of great
			poverty and violence. For some,
			the only escape was through drugs.

					DATA
			I fail to comprehend how a
			chemical substance can provide
			an escape.

53A  CONTINUED: (2)

					TASHA
			It doesn't. But it makes you
			think it does.
				(a beat)
			You have to understand -- drugs
			can make you feel good.

	Wesley and Data listen intently.

					TASHA
				(continuing)
			They put you on top of the world.
			You're happy... Sure of yourself.
			In control. A lot of people never
			feel that otherwise.

					DATA
			But it is artificial.

					TASHA
			It doesn't feel artificial. It
			feels natural, good, and mind
			expanding.
				(a beat)
			Until the drug wears off. Then
			you pay the price. Once you come
			down, you're lower than when you
			started. So you take the drug
			again -- and it kicks you back
			up. But not as high this time.

					WESLEY
				(catching on)
			So you take more.

					TASHA
			But each peak gets lower and
			the valleys get deeper. Before
			you know it -- you're taking the
			drug not to feel good but to keep
			from feeling bad.

					WESLEY
			And that's the trap.

					TASHA
			You think the drug expands your
			universe -- but it actually
			shrinks it. Shrinks it to where
			you and the drug are all that's
			left.

				(a beat)
			Pretty soon, all you care about

			You'll lie, cheat, steal --

					DATA
			Certainly by then you would
			realize the danger.

					TASHA
			That's the worst of it. You don't
			care. The drug is your salvation
			-- your survival. Nothing else
			is important.

	Wesley thinks it over and, after a beat, shakes his
	head.

					WESLEY
			I guess I just don't understand.

	Tasha smiles and puts a hand on his shoulder.

			Stop. I can't listen. T'Jon...

					PICARD
			I'm sorry.

	T'Jon then turns and puts a death grip on the person
	nearest to him. Commander Riker.

					T'JON
			Take us to our planet - leave us
			there with our medicine or this
			person dies.

	Picard takes a STEP FORWARD, then STOPS.

					T'JON
				(continuing)
			Don't you see -- I have no choice.
			We were sent to bring back the
			Felicium. The suffering on my
			planet is too great. People are
			dying. It doesn't matter any more

			Let him go.

			Take us there now -- or give us

					PICARD
			I will not be coerced.

					T'JON
			I'll do it. I'll kill him.

	The strain of the pressure is all over T'Jon.

					PICARD
				(calmly)
			No you won't. You're not a killer
			and neither am I.

	T'Jon releases Riker, who sags a little, then catches

			Help us... please... help us.

			You don't know that for sure.

					BEVERLY
			It had to.

					PICARD
			But somehow, one of your ancestors
			realized that your desire for the
			drug continued after the disease
			had been cured. They made the
			connection and were able to end
			their addiction.

					BEVERLY
				(scornful)
			But these same wonderful people
			also realized that their neighbors
			never found out. Their need for
			the drug grew to the point it is
			now. Your sole source of support
			comes from providing the narcotic.

					PICARD
			And the refinement process of
			which you are so proud was a way
			to make Felicium even more
			addicting... and tighten your
			grip on the Ornarans even further.

					LANGOR
			Are you going to tell them?

					PICARD
			No. I can't tell them. You see,
			I am bound by the rules of the
			United Federation of Planets,
			which say I am not to interfere
			in other worlds, other cultures.
			To tell them any of this would
			be interfering and would violate
			the Prime Directive.

					SOBI
				(suspicious)
			You're talking to us about it...

					PICARD
			Telling you things you already
			know... which changes nothing.

					BEVERLY
			Jean-Luc. I can synthesize
			something which will alleviate
			their suffering and make
			withdrawal painless.

					LANGOR
			That won't be necessary, because
			if I understand the captain, he
			is going to allow the Ornarans
			to have the Felicium.

					PICARD
			Yes, I am.

					BEVERLY
			You can't do that. Some things
			go beyond words on a page. These
			Brekkians have knowingly enslaved
			others. They have caused untold
			suffering and hardship, just so
			their pitiful lives could be
			easier. At least don't give the
