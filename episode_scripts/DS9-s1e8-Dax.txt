3A   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

					SISKO
			Station log.  Stardate 46910.1.  Chief 
			O'Brien has the sad duty of escorting 
			his wife back to earth to attend her 
			mother's funeral.  For the next few 
			weeks, it will up to the rest of us 
			to keep this station up and running.

4    INT. REPLIMAT

	Dax and Bashir are having some coffee as she studies a PADD...

					BASHIR
			It's almost as though the re-
			filtration processors were waiting 
			for Chief O'Brien to leave before 
			breaking down...

					DAX
			The technology looks like something 
			the Cardassians might have taken 
			from the Romulans...
				(to herself)
			Is that an R-C-L type one matrix 
			field?

					BASHIR
				(bored, trying to be 
				clever)
			Perhaps we ought to call in a Romulan 
			repair service...

	He gets not a crack of a smile from Dax who studies her 
	PADD...

                DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - TEASER               1A.


4    CONTINUED:

					DAX
				(to herself)
			Or is it an R-C-L type two...

	Bashir frowns at her nonresponsiveness, more bored, he sips 
	the last drop of his coffee...

					BASHIR
				(re: the coffee)
			Another raktajino?

					DAX
				(still studying, no 
				eye contact)
			It would keep me up all night.

					BASHIR
				(flirting)
			I know better ways to keep you up 
			all night... and they're more fun 
			than drinking Klingon coffee...

	Now she looks up evenly... he smiles boyishly at her... she 
	looks back down at the PADD...

					DAX
			Definitely type one...

	Bashir frowns...

5    ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PROMENADE

	A male Trill, SELIN PEERS, stands unobtrusively watching Dax 
	and Bashir.

5    CONTINUED:

	Now, as we're watching Peers, he's approached by three 
	other humanoids:  A male we'll later come to know as TANDRO 
	(mid-30's), and a First and Second Klaestron Officer (First 
	Officer is a strong male; Second Officer a strong female -- 
	whose garb may tend to make her gender less evident than it 
	ordinarily might be).

6    CLOSER - GROUP

	The three new arrivals will follow the direction of Peers's 
	identifying nod, as:

                DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - TEASER                3.

6    CONTINUED:

					PEERS
				(indicating)
			Dax.

7    RESUME - DAX & BASHIR IN REPLIMAT

					DAX
				(starts Rising)
			I really should be getting to bed.

					BASHIR
				(rises quickly)
			May I escort you to your quarters...

					DAX
				(smiles nicely)
			That's not necessary, Julian.

					BASHIR
			Oh, goodnight then...

	She Nods graciously to him, and EXITS.

8    ANGLE FAVORING GROUP

	Tandro, and the First & Second Officer -- with Peers staying 
	put -- move casually (remaining as unobtrusive as possible) -- 
	to follow Dax.

                DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - TEASER                4.

9    ON BASHIR

					BASHIR
				(to himself)
			... "Not necessary, Julian"...
				(sudden, happy decision)
			... But not forbidden, either.

	And now it's Bashir who Moves off after the departed Dax.

10   INT. CORRIDOR ONE

	Dax Moves along the deserted corridor.  Tandro and the two 
	officers move quickly up behind her.  (NOTE: First Officer 
	wears a bulging pouch -- approx.  6" x 9" in size -- on his 
	belt.)

					TANDRO
			Dax.

	She stops and turns, inquiringly.  Not anticipating any 
	trouble, her demeanor and stance are open and pleasantly 
	casual, as:

					DAX
			Yes... ?

	Tandro Nods to the First & Second Officer, who brace Dax; 
	one on either side.

					TANDRO
			You are Dax...

					DAX
				(far less casual)
			What do you want?

	Tandro Nods again to the First Officer, who quickly places 
	one hand across Dax's mouth, and twists her other hand behind 
	her to render her helpless.  She is nonetheless beginning to 
	struggle, as:

11   BASHIR

	... rounds the corner into the corridor... sees Dax struggling 
	in the First Officer's grasp.  Without hesitation, he hurls 
	himself forward into the scuffle.

                DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - TEASER                5.

12   WIDER ANGLE

	Bashir cannonballs first into Tandro, knocking him into the 
	corridor wall, against which his head BUMPS sufficiently 
	hard to stun him briefly.  Dax uses the micro-momentary 
	distraction of the First Officer to twist aside, and ram her 
	elbow into the latter's ribs.  He GASPS, but is equally quick, 
	and far stronger than Dax.  Yanking her back toward him, he 
	first reaches toward her combadge...

13   INSERT - DAX'S COMBADGE

	First Officer's Hand ENTERS FRAME to Rip away Dax's combadge.

14   RESUME - WIDER ANGLE

	The First Officer delivers a short, sharp chop which knocks 
	Dax unconscious.

15   BASHIR & SECOND OFFICER

	Bashir has wheeled around to deal with the Second Officer.  
	As he cocks his fist to deliver a punch, he sees, for the 
	first time --

15A  CLOSE - SECOND OFFICER'S FACE

	She's obviously a woman.

15B  CLOSE REACTION - BASHIR

	Realizing her gender, Bashir Freezes in place...

16   RESUME - WIDER ANGLE

	... which was a big mistake.  The woman clips Bashir with a 
	single right cross which knocks him cold.  As Bashir sinks, 
	the First Officer has hoisted the unconscious Dax over his 
	shoulder, and now -- carrying her -- accompanies Tandro and 
	the Second Officer, as they hurriedly EXIT.  MOVE IN SLOWLY 
	on Bashir's cold-cocked body lying crumpled on the deck.  
	HOLD, before we...

									FADE OUT.

18   INT. OPS

	Kira is on duty, working a console (Supernumeraries as 
	needed) -- as Sisko approaches her from his (O.S.) 
	office.  He's apparently been meeting with ODO, since,
	the latter has come out with him, and will remain
	watching relaxedly from the steps, during:

					SISKO
			Yes, Major.

					KIRA
				(off console)
			I'm just not sure, Commander.  What's 
			it look like to you?

	She perplexedly indicates a monitor reading (which we needn't 
	see)... And as Sisko looks at it:

					SISKO
				(equally uncertain)
			It looks like a residual charge in 
			the graviton generator.  If that's 
			what it is, it'll bleed off.  Let's 
			run a quick level three diagnostic, 
			just to be sure.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT ONE                7.

19   INT. CORRIDOR ONE

	Bashir GROANS and stirs... rolls over... makes it to his 
	hands and knees, shaking his head to clear it.  Then:

					BASHIR
				(taps combadge)
			Bashir... to Ops...

	Even as he's speaking, Bashir notices Dax's combadge on the 
	deck nearby.  He starts reaching for it, as we go to:

20   INT. OPS

	Everybody as we just saw them.

					KIRA
				(casual Response)
			Ops.

21   INT. CORRIDOR ONE - INTERCUT WITH OPS (AS DESIRED)

	Bashir now holds, and stares down at, Dax's Combadge.

					BASHIR
				(still groggy)
			... Three people... I think they just 
			took Jadzia.  She was struggling 
			with them, and I tried to help, but... 
			I don't know, I'm...

	Odo moves instantly forward toward a separate console, during:

					SISKO
			Full station security alert; secure 
			all Turbolifts; seal off airlocks to 
			levels four through twelve... 
			Computer, locate Lieutenant Dax.

					COMPUTER
			Lieutenant Dax is on Level Six, 
			Corridor One.

					BASHIR
			No, that's where I am... They only 
			left her combadge here...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE                8.

21   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			How long ago, Doctor?

					BASHIR
			Not long, uh... I'm... not quite 
			sure, really.

					ODO
			Computer: Display all passages, levels 
			four through twelve; in sequence.

22   INT. CORRIDOR TWO

	Tandro, the First and Second Officers hauling Dax along... 
	Dax, hanging loosely in the dual grasp, is just regaining 
	consciousness.  As Tandro is again consulting his PADD:

					DAX
				(groggy)
			What... what are you doing?

	No reply.  Tandro gestures ahead...

					TANDRO
			We turn right at the next corridor...

	The First & Second Officers both use their free hands to 
	pull small weapons from their pockets... and they all proceed 
	PAST CAMERA...

23   INT. OPS - INCLUDING ODO'S MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	We'll see a series of CORRIDOR, PROMENADE & AIRLOCK-ENTRANCE 
	SHOTS FLASH ONTO THE SCREEN in sequence: CORRIDOR ONE contains 
	Bashir... One or two PROMENADE ANGLES may include a Few 
	casually walking Pedestrians... the Two or Three AIRLOCK-
	ENTRANCE ANGLES will show no one.  Throughout the above:

					ODO
			They're managing to avoid the security 
			tracking grid.  They seem to know a 
			lot about the station.

            DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE 8A-9.               

23   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			Then they may know the speed of our 
			Runabouts... if they do, they probably 
			have a faster ship to make their 
			escape...

					SISKO
			Major, survey all ships in dock that 
			have a high warp capability.
				(Beat; sudden 
				realization)
			Damn!

					ODO
			What.

24   ANOTHER ANGLE

	We can no longer see what's on Odo's monitor, as he continues 
	to work his console.

					SISKO
			That's why we've got a residual charge 
			in the graviton generator.  They've 
			disabled the tractor beam.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT ONE               10.

24   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(off monitor)
			We've got eight ships in dock that're 
			capable of warp five or more: Three 
			on docking pylons; five smaller ones 
			in the ports.

					SISKO
			Seal off all docking ring airlocks.

					ODO
			Security.  All duty squads to the 
			docking ring; commence immediate 
			inward sweep, levels sixteen through 
			twenty-one.

27   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	Dax, Tandro, First & Second Officers ENTER...

28   INT. OPS (OPTICAL)

	On Kira's monitor, we see Dax et al in Airlock Five's 
	corridor.

					KIRA
			I've got them!  Airlock five...

	Oddly, Sisko will turn away from the goings-on... will move 
	to Dax's science station, where he'll begin studiously working 
	a console.  Odo, on the move --

					ODO
			I'm on my way.  Odo to Security.  
			Report to airlock corridor five.  We 
			have a hostage situation.

	He EXITS to the Turbolift...

					KIRA
			Isolating with cadderon force fields.
				(what's Sisko up to?)
			... Commander?

					SISKO
				(preoccupied at console)
			You're doing fine, Major.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/19/92 - ACT ONE               11.

29   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	A FORCE FIELD suddenly BLINKS INTO POSITION across the 
	corridor in front of Dax and her abductors.  They're 

	momentarily stopped... Until the First Officer withdraws a 
	small PADD from his belt pouch.  Move to a companel... the 
	back of the PADD attached magnetically to the surface of the 
	companel... on the face of the PADD there is an alien keyboard 
	and the First Officer taps in a seven digit sequence...

					DAX
			Will you just tell me what you...

	Her speech is Interrupted by the Loud ZAP of the suddenly 
	Disengaged force field.  They've "hot-wired" it -- and the 
	path before them is again clear.

					TANDRO
				(tugging Dax)
			Move.

	And they resume their progress along the corridor.

32   INT. OPS

	Everyone is as we last saw them.

					KIRA
			The force field is down... They know 
			the security override codes... They're 
			boarding a ship...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE               12.

32   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(off console)
			I'm trying to speed up the bleed-off 
			process in the graviton generator.

					KIRA
				(shakes her head)
			We've lost them...

33   EXT. SPACE - DS9 (OPTICAL)

	A mid-sized ship pulls away from the dock...

			The excess charge is neutralizing...

					SISKO
			Engage tractor beam!

39   EXT. SPACE - DS9 & KLAESTRON SHIP (OPTICAL)

	Just as the ship begins to pick up speed... the tractor beam 
	SHOOTS OUT and captures it...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE               14.

40   INT. OPS

					KIRA
				(smiles)
			Gotcha.

	And now it's Sisko EXITING toward the Turbolift, during:

					SISKO
			Bring it in to docking port six, 
			Major.

41   OMITTED

42   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	Sisko, Odo and two weapons-ready N.D. Bajoran Deputies and a 
	Starfleet Security Guard stand facing the closed airlock.  
	Beat... the hatch opens... Tandro is the first to step out.

					ODO
			Slowly!  Extremities where I can see 
			them.

					TANDRO
				(unphased)
			You're the Chief of security?

	Dax appears behind Tandro...

					ODO
				(to Dax)
			Are you all right?

	DAX nods, as:

					TANDRO
			My name is Ilon Tandro...

43   CLOSE REACTION - DAX

	Stunned -- as she obviously recognizes both the name, and:

					TANDRO (O.S.) (Cont'd)
			... Special envoy from Klaestron 
			Four... I'm in charge of this 
			extradition procedure...

	From this point, and after digesting her initial shock, Dax's 
	expression and demeanor literally "shut down."


               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE               15.

43   CONTINUED:

	An implacable, impenetrable mask; unreadable and 
	unfathomable.

44   RESUME - SHOT

					SISKO
			Extradition!  I call this kidnapping 
			and assault.

	Odo gestures his Deputies and Security Guard to take the 
	four culprits in tow.  (We'll assume that Peers went straight 
	to the ship after identifying Dax.) Tandro reaches into his 
	tunic... draws out a micro-disk... hands it to Sisko, during:

					TANDRO
				(re: micro-disk)
			You'll find this to be a valid warrant 
			for her arrest.  The relevant treaty 
			between Klaestron Four and your 
			Federation allows for unilateral 
			extradition.

					SISKO
				(dubious)
			And the charge?

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE               16.

44   CONTINUED:

					TANDRO
			The fugitive Dax is charged with 
			treason... and the murder of my 
			father.

	In surprised perplexion, Sisko looks to Dax for a response.  
	None comes.  Her face remains a tight and closed, utterly 
	uncommunicative stone wall.  MOVE IN and HOLD on that face, 
	as we...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

45   EXT. SPACE - DS9 (OPTICAL)

	Re-Establishing.  The Klaestron ship still at the docking 
	ring.

46   INT. SECURITY OFFICE

	With Sisko standing by, Odo works at his console and monitor 
	(the screen of which we needn't see).

					ODO
				(off monitor)
			According to the charge statement, 
			Dax was responsible for the death of 
			General Ardelon Tandro thirty years 
			ago...

					SISKO
			Thirty years ago?  That would've 
			been Curzon Dax.

					ODO
				(nods, off console)
			... when he was on Klaestron Four as 
			a Federation mediator during their 
			civil war...

					SISKO
			He never mentioned he'd even been to 
			"Klaestron Four"... Strange.

					ODO
			Not so strange considering these 
			charges.

					SISKO
			Odo, let me tell you something: Curzon 
			Dax tended to be a little cavalier 
			about life... and even about his 
			personal responsibilities from time 
			to time...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO              17A.

46   CONTINUED:

					SISKO (Cont'd)
				(smiles; recalling)
			... I think part of the reason I liked 
			him so much was that he had more 
			faults than the usual, socially 
			acceptable Trill.
				(back to reality)
			He was not a murderer.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               18.

46   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			How about a "traitor"?
				(off monitor)
			This says Dax betrayed the Klaestron 
			government to the rebels.

					SISKO
				(dismissive)
			It's all nonsense.  I'm telling you, 
			Constable, I knew the man.

					ODO
				(beat)
			But did you know the symbiont inside 
			the man?

	And they just look at each other... Each from his own 
	perspective.

47   INT. DAX'S QUARTERS

	She sits alone... in the dark.  The door CHIMES.  As she 
	turns on a moderate light:

					DAX
			Come in.

	Sisko ENTERS.  She knows what's coming... returns to her 
	seat... to stare straight ahead -- at her own thoughts -- 
	during:

					SISKO
			I've sent a subspace message 
			to Klaestron Four requesting 
			confirmation of the warrant.  That's 
			the only stall I could think of.  
			Now what the hell's going on, Dax?

	As Dax doesn't reply:

					SISKO
			Dax, if I'm going to help you, you've 
			got to help me.

					DAX
			I don't expect help, Benjamin.  Thank 
			you, though.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               19.

47   CONTINUED:

	His frustration growing, Sisko paces, with:

					SISKO
			Are you crazy?  Treason and murder.  
			On Klaestron Four, either of those 
			gets you the death penalty.
				(faces her squarely)
			What's the matter with you!  Talk to 
			me before I have to let these people 
			take you.

					DAX
				(quiet resignation)
			No.  I'm sorry, Benjamin, but... no.

	Sisko will try another tack.  He sits, and:

					SISKO
				(quietly)
			We've got eighteen or twenty years 
			of friendship behind us.

					DAX
			I'm Jadzia Dax now.  It was Curzon 
			Dax you knew for twenty years.

					SISKO
			So when the Dax part of you survived 
			from one host to the next, it really 
			didn't take our friendship along.

					DAX
			Benjamin, you know you're still my 
			very dear friend.  I just... won't 
			talk about this; I'm sorry.

	Sisko rises again... Not much more to be said here... Except:

					SISKO
				(gentle conviction)
			Well, whether you're Curzon Dax or 
			Jadzia Dax, I'm not going to believe 
			for one second that you've ever 
			committed murder, or treason.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               20.

47   CONTINUED:	(2)

					DAX
				(reflexively starts 
				to explain)
			Benjamin...
				(stops herself; beat)
			... If you don't mind... I'd prefer 
			being alone right now.

					SISKO
				(exiting)
			There is one thing I'd charge you 
			with...
				(stops; faces her for 
				emphasis)
			... Acute stubbornness.
				(finishes EXITING)

	Dax is left alone again.  She reaches over... turns off 
	the light... sits again in the darkness.  SLOWLY MOVE 
	IN on her FACE.  HOLD for a beat, before:

48   INT. SISKO'S OFFICE

	Sisko, with Kira alongside, faces Tandro.

					TANDRO
			You've received your confirmation, 
			Commander; now we'd like to be on 
			our way with the prisoner.

	Throughout the following, Sisko's demeanor will -- despite 
	his words -- remain most pleasant... most conversational.

					SISKO
			You know, Mister Tandro... I kept 
			wondering why you tried to kidnap 
			Lieutenant Dax, rather than just 
			present your warrant to me in the 
			proper way.  I couldn't figure that 
			out at first.

					TANDRO
			I trust you have figured out, 
			Commander, that our extradition treaty 
			with your Federation is current and 
			valid.

					SISKO
			This station is technically Bajoran.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               21.

48   CONTINUED:

					TANDRO
				(already knows the 
				answer)
			What does that mean to us?

					SISKO
			You don't have an extradition treaty 
			with Bajor.  I think that's why you 
			tried to abduct Lieutenant Dax.  You 
			were afraid the Bajorans would refuse 
			extradition.

					TANDRO
			That's absurd.  No Bajoran interests 
			are even involved here.

					KIRA
			How did you people know your way 
			around this station so well?

					TANDRO
				(disdain)
			My conversation is with the Commander.

					SISKO
			No, I think your conversation is 
			with my First Officer now.

					KIRA
			You Klaestrons are allies of the 
			Cardassians.  Your knowledge of this 
			station confirms that.  They must 
			have given you the layout... Which 
			not only compromises Bajoran security, 
			but also... annoys us.

	It will be evident to us from their overly courteous deference 
	to each other, that Sisko and Kira have already decided 
	between them exactly what the following dialogue will confirm 
	to Tandro.

					SISKO
				(almost apologetic)
			I'm afraid it means Bajoran interests 
			are involved.  And Bajor is adamant 
			that...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               22.

48   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO (Cont'd)
				(courteous aside to 
				Kira)
			... At least I believe it's adamant...

					KIRA
				(with satisfaction)
			Oh, yes...

					SISKO
			You see... There will have to be an 
			extradition hearing before I can 
			lawfully release Lieutenant Dax.

	Off Tandro's reaction...

49   OMITTED

50   INT. QUARK'S

					QUARK
				(reacts aghast)
			For how long?

					ODO
			As long as it takes.

					QUARK
			That could be days!

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               23.

50   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			There's nowhere else on the station 
			that's suitable.

					QUARK
			Too bad.  I'm not shutting down for 
			any Bajoran hearing...

					ODO
			I'm sure Lieutenant Dax would 
			appreciate it...

	Quark pauses a beat at her name... but when it's profit versus 
	sex---

					QUARK
				(shakes his head)
			Business is business.

	Subject closed... he moves away, wipes the bar... Odo takes 
	a beat, look around...

					ODO
			You know, that wall's going to have 
			to come in about five meters...

					QUARK
			What are you talking about?

					ODO
			Of course, after you move the wall 
			that'll mean your second level 
			holosuites'll have to come down...

					QUARK
			Come down?  Why?

					ODO
			New restrictions...

					QUARK
			Restrictions?

					ODO
			Building codes... Since the 
			provisional government took over, 
			they've got their hands into 
			everything... and of course, I'm the 
			one who's expected to enforce their 
			rules here.

           DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO 23A-24.              

50   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			You know, I think the bar is a little 
			too near the exit...

					QUARK
			This is blackmail...

					ODO
			No, it's just business... And business 
			is business...

	On Quark's reaction...

51   INT. PROMENADE OUTSIDE QUARK'S

	Sisko is walking toward us along the Promenade -- as Odo 
	emerges from Quark's.

					SISKO
			I was just coming to see you.  We 
			still haven't found any place for 
			the hearing.  Holding it on Bajor 
			would involve Dax leaving the station, 
			and I don't want to risk that.

					ODO
			Well, now that's a coincidence.  Our 
			good friend Quark just donated the 
			use of his facility for the hearing.

					SISKO
				(reacts, surprised)
			Nice gesture.

					ODO
			I thought so.

					SISKO
			You know I haven't been able to get 
			a word out of Dax about any of this.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               25.

51   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			So I thought someone might go do 
			some investigating on Klaestron Four 
			itself.  What do you think?

					ODO
				(dubious)
			This case has thirty years of dust 
			covering it.  The extradition 
			hearing'll take about thirty minutes.

					SISKO
			I'm hoping to make it a little longer 
			than that.

					ODO
				(fat chance)
			Good luck.

53   INT. QUARK'S - E.C.U. ON RENORA'S FACE

	Though much older, Judge ELS RENORA appears to be in her 
	60's.  Handsome and hard.  But the glint in her eyes bespeaks 
	as much a capacity for wry humor as for judicial crispity.

					RENORA
			This will be an informal hearing, so 
			I'll start with some informal advice 
			to all:  I'm one hundred years old.  
			I've no time to squander listening 
			to superfluous language.  In short, 
			I intend being here until supper, 
			not senility.  Understood?

54   WIDER ANGLE

	Tables and chair have been arranged with Sisko and Dax on 
	one side; Tandro on the other.  All facing Renora (who may 
	be on an improvised raised platform behind the bar, or, if 
	desired, in a slightly raised seat anywhere else that's the 
	center of everyone's focus).  Others present, include Kira, 
	Bashir and Selin Peers (the male who first pointed out Dax, 
	then trailed behind the kidnappers).  In addition, we'll see 
	(in b.g.) Quark, the Dabo Girl, the Ferengi Waiter and Morn.  
	Sisko and Tandro are on their feet, facing Renora, as:

					TANDRO
			Understood, Madame Arbiter.

	Renora BANGS her ball-gavel down once, before:

					RENORA
				(to Tandro)
			You seek the extradition... Make 
			your case.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               27.

54   CONTINUED:

					TANDRO
			The accused Trill, whatever its 
			present appearance may be, was and 
			is a Federation officer who committed 
			capital crimes on our planet.  Since 
			there is no time limit on the 
			prosecution of such crimes...

					RENORA
				(overriding)
			Thank you, I've already read the 
			warrant and charges.  The crimes 
			described are thirty years old.  
			What took you so long?

					TANDRO
			The evidence was contained in military 
			files which were officially sealed 
			until recently.

					RENORA
			Fine.  Sit.  Commander, the warrant's 
			in order.  On what grounds do you 
			ask me to deny extradition?

					SISKO
			You say the warrant's in order.  But 
			the name on the warrant is "Dax."  
			Certainly that doesn't refer to Jadzia 
			Dax, a female; but to the now deceased 
			Curzon Dax, a male.
				(indicates Dax)
			... This young woman wasn't even born 
			thirty years ago.

					TANDRO
			You're arguing semantics.  This 
			creature is a Trill.  The symboint 
			known as Dax has progressed from one 
			host to the next.

					SISKO
			Exactly.  From one host to the next.  
			A different host; a different person.  
			So I submit that the person he wants 
			to extradite no longer exists.  And 
			I challenge him to prove otherwise.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO               28.

54   CONTINUED:	(2)

					TANDRO
			That's ridiculous.

	Renora's ball-gavel BANGS down once more, before:

					RENORA
			It would've been easier on me had 
			you not raised that point, Commander.
				(to Tandro)
			But the penalty for these crimes on 
			your planet is death; and that's 
			rather permanent.  So before I grant 
			extradition, you will convince me, 
			please, that the person named in 
			your warrant is the same person that's 
			sitting here now.

55   REACTION - SISKO & DAX

	His face reflects his tremendous, pleased relief.  But as he 
	then looks, almost reflexively, at Dax for a sharing of that 
	emotion, he notes that her blank, even detached, expression 
	has either not changed -- or has become ever-so-slightly 
	more sad.  MOVE IN on SISKO'S PERPLEXED FACE, and HOLD, before 
	we...

	Sisko, Kira and Bashir.

					BASHIR
			Excuse me, Sir.  I don't know that

					SISKO
			Then that answer's wrong.  From this

				(beat; quiet aside)
			... But if you do find a... "wrong"

	Odo appears on screen, standing in front of a neutral

					SISKO

58   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Just a delaying action; it's all I 
			could do.  I'm still hoping you'll 
			find something there on the planet 
			that'll negate the charges.

					ODO
			Well, I know two things so far: 
			Whoever did murder this General 
			Ardelon Tandro, it got his troops so 
			mad they went out and won their civil 
			war.  They made the General a national 
			martyr.  There are statues of him 
			all over the place.  Second:  everyone 
			that's old enough to remember says 
			the General and Curzon Dax were the 
			closest of friends... Comrades; 
			inseparable.

					SISKO
			Now that sounds like the Curzon Dax 
			I knew.

					ODO
			Treason, plus the murder of his own 
			best friend?  Strange business.  If 
			those charges are true, I'd want to 
			hang Curzon Dax up by the heels 
			myself.

					SISKO
				(acerbic)
			Thanks for the confidence.

					ODO
			Don't worry, I'll do my job.  General 
			Tandro left a widow.  If the two men 
			were that close, she has to remember 
			something about Curzon Dax that's 
			not in the record.  You'll hear from 
			me.

	Sisko's screen blanks.  He sits back in thought, before:

	ENINA TANDRO, slightly past middle age, but still regal in 
	bearing, stands facing Odo with:

					ENINA
			Curzon Dax was not responsible for 
			the death of my husband.

					ODO
				(reacts to the 
				surprising new ally)
			You're certain of that?

					ENINA
			Without a doubt.

					ODO
			But your own son...

					ENINA
			My son is obsessed with the death of 
			a father he never knew... I tried to 
			persuade him not to reopen the case.  
			He wouldn't listen to anyone... least 
			of all to me.
				(closer, more intimate)
			You have to understand -- Curzon Dax 
			was closer to the General than any 
			man on this planet.  He was a dear 
			friend to this family.  Curzon would 
			have died himself before conspiring 
			against my husband.

					ODO
			Is that a personal opinion... or are 
			there any facts that might support...

					ENINA
			The only facts I know are in my son's 
			hands... and he intends to use them 
			against Dax.

              DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT THREE             32A.

59   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			It might help my people to know what 
			they are...

					ENINA
			There's proof of a secret transmission 
			that was sent from military 
			headquarters to the enemy camp.  It 
			identified the exact route my husband 
			was taking from the capitol back to 
			the front.  That's when he was 
			ambushed and kidnapped... a short 
			time later, he was killed.

					ODO
			Then your son must believe that Dax 
			made that transmission...

					ENINA
				(acknowledges)
			There were only five people including 
			my husband who knew the route.  My 
			son's been able to establish the 
			whereabouts of all of them at the 
			time of the transmission... all of 
			them except Curzon.

					ODO
			So, Dax has no alibi.

					ENINA
			That can't possibly be enough to 
			convict him, can it?

	Odo takes a thoughtful beat...

					ODO
			I don't know.
				(rises)
			Thank you.  You've been helpful.

	He starts to leave... as a casual afterthought...

					ENINA
			How is he?

					ODO
			Ma'am?

					ENINA
			Curzon Dax.

					ODO
			He's gone.
				(she reacts)
			The Dax your son is trying to 
			extradite is "Jadzia Dax"; a twenty-
			eight year old woman.  Curzon Dax 
			died two years ago.  Jadzia's the 
			new host.

					ENINA
				(reacts but covers 
				well)
			I'm sorry.  I didn't... know.

	Odo nods and EXITS and we stay a beat on Enina...

	Quark's been standing near the entrance -- away from

	from among the various Onlookers. He uses his small
	Ferengi PADD as a kind of calculator... as he now

61   FULL SHOT

	We see that the room's set up as before -- with the addition 
	of a witness chair before, and to the left of, Judge Renora.  
	Tandro is standing, as Peers (again, this is the guy we saw 
	pointing out Dax in the Teaser) moves to sit in the witness 
	chair.  As he's done so:

					TANDRO
			Minister Peers, we're fortunate to 
			have you with us...

					RENORA
			Excuse me.  It also seems rather 
			convenient to have you with us.  How 
			do you come to be here?

62   FAVORING TANDRO & PEERS

					PEERS
			Because another Trill is involved, 
			the Trillian government requested 
			that I be present during the 
			extradition.

					RENORA
			And do you know the accused 
			personally?

					PEERS
			I do not.

					RENORA
			We'll accept you as an expert on 
			Trills.  Proceed.

					TANDRO
			Minister, through how many hosts

			matter of fact.

					TANDRO
			Do you remember what you thought and 
			felt when you were joined with your 
			first host?

					PEERS
			Yes; the symbiont does carry memories 
			of times shared with previous hosts.

	Tandro moves toward Dax, eyes bore down on her...

					TANDRO
			So if a crime is committed by a Trill, 
			then the symbiont's next host would 
			remain aware of it... would recall 
			that crime?

					PEERS
			Yes, absolutely.

					TANDRO
			Would recall the details of it.

					PEERS
			Yes, absolutely.

					TANDRO
			And would still feel the guilt of 
			it.

					PEERS
			Oh yes.

	Sisko notes Dax stiffening under the pressure -- must do 
	something to relieve it:

					SISKO
			Madame Arbiter, this is not a trial... 
			and Mister Tandro is not the 
			prosecutor...

					RENORA
				(to Tandro)
			You've made your point, Mister Tandro.

              DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/20/92 - ACT THREE              36.

62   CONTINUED:	(3)

					TANDRO
			I don't believe I have, Madame 
			Arbiter.  The real point is that 
			Commander Sisko would have you endorse 
			his idea of a perfect Trill crime... 
			to commit it, all one has to do is 
			elude capture long enough to change 
			hosts, then he... or she can go free.

	Tandro politely sits... confident... and thus content to let 
	Sisko take the floor.

					SISKO
			Minister Peers... You said you were 
			with your first host throughout her 
			"adult" life.

					PEERS
			Yes...

					SISKO
			So before a symbiont is joined with 
			any host, that host has already lived 
			a significant portion of his or her 
			life.  From birth to... what age, 
			sir?

					PEERS
			Early-to-mid-twenties.

					SISKO
			Why not younger?

					PEERS
			To give the prospective host the 
			chance to develop; mature... They 
			have to be old enough to make an 
			informed judgement as to whether or 
			not they really want to be joined.

              DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT THREE              37.

62   CONTINUED:	(4)

					SISKO
			And once they are joined, the host's 
			personality is completely suppressed 
			by the symbiont?

					PEERS
			Oh, no.  No, it's a joining.  It's a 
			total sharing, a blending, of both 
			host and symbiont.  Neither is 
			suppressed by the other.

              DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/20/92 - ACT THREE              38.

62   CONTINUED:	(5)

					SISKO
			So with each new host there does 
			come, in fact, a new personality.  A 
			new combined person.  A different 
			person.

					PEERS
			From that standpoint, yes.

					SISKO
			Well I for one don't know what other 
			standpoint we could be talking about, 
			thank you, Minister.

	Peers starts to rise from the witness chair as...

					TANDRO
			Just to return us to what's important 
			here, Madame Arbiter... the accused 
			can remember any crimes she committed 
			as Curzon Dax and nothing can be 
			truthfully asserted in this hearing 
			that can alter that fact.

					SISKO
			Yes, the memories were passed to an 
			entirely new host... to an entirely 
			different person...

					TANDRO
			This is outrageous... you can't let 
			Dax get away with murder.

              DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/17/92 - ACT THREE              39.

62   CONTINUED:	(6)

					RENORA
				(bangs ball-gavel)
			I said an "informal" hearing; not 
			riotous.  We'll have a two hour 
			recess.

62A  ON SISKO AND DAX

	Dax remains just sitting there; alone and aloof, as:

					SISKO
			Still nothing to say?

					DAX
			Just "thank you."  I know you're 
			trying very hard.

					SISKO
			I didn't mean that.

					DAX
			I know.

					SISKO
			Your silence makes you look guilty.  
			At least deny something.

	Re-Establishing.

66   INT. QUARK'S

	Starting on Renora's close-up...

					RENORA
			The answer seems simple enough to me -- 
			split her down the middle.  Send the 
			symbiont back for trial and leave 
			the host here.

	Moving to REVEAL Bashir in the witness chair... Sisko and 
	Kira are at their table.

					BASHIR
			I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated 
			than that.

					RENORA
				(wryly)
			Oh, what a surprise.  Please enlighten 
			me.

					BASHIR
			The symbiont and the host are 
			biologically interdependent.  Ninety-
			three hours after they've joined, 
			neither can survive without the other.

					RENORA
			I see.  Proceed, Commander.

					SISKO
			Doctor, you've heard the arguments.  
			From a medical viewpoint, are Curzon 
			Dax and Jadzia Dax the same person...

					BASHIR
			Obviously not.  Aside from the gender 
			change, there's a marked difference 
			in blood types; metabolisms; nervous 
			systems, height, weight...

					TANDRO
			This is not at all relevant...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FOUR              42.

66   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
				(determined to get 
				his testimony out)
			What is relevant, sir... is my 
			analysis of the brain waves of Curzon 
			and Jadzia Dax...

	Sisko hands Renora a PADD which she examines...

					SISKO
			Madame Arbiter...

					BASHIR
			As you can see, they are distinctly 
			different... clearly illustrating 
			that Curzon and Jadzia are two unique 
			individuals.

	Done, satisfied... he takes a breath and smiles warmly toward 
	Jadzia...

67   ON DAX

	Understanding his affection and anxiousness to help her, Dax 
	returns his smile nicely -- if wanly -- during:

					SISKO
			Thank-you, Doctor.

68   RESUME

	Tandro moves forward...

					TANDRO
			Doctor, I've looked through your 
			research myself... it's quite 
			impressive work for such a young 
			man...

					BASHIR
				(guarded)
			Thank you.

					TANDRO
			As a layman, there are obviously things 
			I don't fully understand...

					BASHIR
			I'll be happy to explain anything 
			you wish...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FOUR              43.

68   CONTINUED:

					TANDRO
			Yes... well, exactly how does the 
			Trill brain work...

					BASHIR
			It's quite complex actually... First 
			of all, there are two cerebral 
			nuclei...

					TANDRO
			Two... ?

					BASHIR
			One in the symbiont and one in the 
			host...

					TANDRO
			Two brains.  And these two brains 
			talk to each other... ?

					BASHIR
				(acknowledges, 
				searching for a 
				comparison)
			Like two computers linked together...

					TANDRO
			That's very clear, Doctor.  Thank 
			you.  Now, in your investigation, 
			were you able to analyze the separate 
			wave patterns from each of these 
			brains?

					BASHIR
				(the one question he 
				didn't want to hear)
			They don't function separately.

	Tandro turns, knows an evasive answer when he hears one.

					TANDRO
			I didn't ask you how they function, 
			Doctor Bashir.  I asked if you could 
			analyze the two distinct patterns.

					BASHIR
			I just don't see the relevance of...

					TANDRO
			Could you?

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/20/92 - ACT FOUR              44.

68   CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			Yes.

					TANDRO
			And have the brainwave patterns of 
			the symbiont changed since it joined 
			with the new host?

					BASHIR
			With the available evidence, there's 
			no way to tell that.

					TANDRO
			What's your best guess?

					BASHIR
			I wouldn't care to guess.

					TANDRO
			In fact, is there evidence of any 
			change at all in the symbiont since 
			it joined with this new host?  Yes 
			or no.

					BASHIR
				(defeated)
			No.

					TANDRO
			Thank-you, Doctor Bashir.  You've 
			been very helpful.

72   ANOTHER ANGLE

	A mortified, thoroughly torpedoed Bashir leaves the chair.  
	He looks -- pleadingly -- over at Dax.  She favors him only 
	with a slight, sympathetic nod -- in understanding of his 
	sabotaged efforts and good intentions.  During the above:

					RENORA
			Any more witnesses, Commander Sisko?

					SISKO
			Yes, Madame Arbiter... I'd like to 
			call the one person in this courtroom 
			who knew Curzon Dax.  Me.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FOUR              45.

72   CONTINUED:

					RENORA
			You know where the witness chair is.

					SISKO
			With your permission, Major Kira 
			will direct the questions.

	Sisko sits as Kira moves forward...

					KIRA
			Tell us a little about Curzon Dax, 
			Commander.

					SISKO
			He probably wasn't the ideal Trill.  
			He drank a little too much; he could 
			be more interested in women than 
			maybe he should've been...

					KIRA
				(feigned surprise)
			I thought he was your friend.

					SISKO
			My point is simply that he was not 
			at all like the young woman in this 
			courtroom.

					KIRA
			What exactly was your relationship 
			with Curzon Dax?

	With an eye toward Dax...

					SISKO
			He took a raw, young Ensign under 
			his wing and taught me to appreciate 
			life in ways I'd never thought about 
			before... he taught me about art and 
			science and diplomacy... whatever 
			sense of honor I may have today, he 
			nurtured... treason, murder -- he 
			wasn't capable of those things.

					TANDRO
			As you've already said, Commander, 
			this is not a trial...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FOUR              46.

72   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
				(to Tandro)
			I'm describing my friend, Curzon Dax -- 
			a man I knew very well. On the other 
			hand...
				(small smile: re Dax)
			I can't tell you too much about my 
			new friend there... We're really 
			just getting to know each other.

	Kira smiles and nods, very nice to Sisko as she looks to 
	Tandro if he has any questions.

73   OMITTED

74   ON DAX

	This time... upon hearing Sisko's words... and warming tone... 
	her smile is wistful... her face reflective now of her 
	sadness.

74A  TANDRO

	moves forward...

					TANDRO
			Commander, Starfleet officers do 
			have the reputation of being 
			honorable... and I judge you to be 
			an honorable man...

	Sisko nods an acknowledgement...

					TANDRO
				(continuing)
			As an honorable man, do you think 
			this crime should go unpunished?

					KIRA
			Madame Arbiter, that has nothing to 
			do with the main issue here.

					TANDRO
				(to Renora)
			It will, Madame...

					RENORA
			Answer the question, Commander...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FOUR             46A.

74A  CONTINUED:


					SISKO
			I would prefer that no crime go 
			unpunished.

					TANDRO
			Then, if it were possible, even you 
			would not argue with punishing the 
			symbiont part of Dax.

					SISKO
				(beat, cagily)
			How can you be so sure that the 
			symbiont was the criminal influence?  
			What if it were the "Curzon" host 
			that was responsible?  Then, the 
			surviving symbiont would be completely 
			innocent.

					TANDRO
				(gotcha)
			No; they'd both be guilty.  You 
			yourself have argued that the two 
			personalities, once joined, function 
			as one.  And your own Doctor Bashir 
			confirmed it.  When you put salt in 
			water, the two become 
			indistinguishable and inseparable.

82   ON SISKO, KIRA & DAX

	Sisko and Kira worried; Dax continuingly passive.  A 
	SUPERNUMERARY ENTERS with a PADD, hands it during the below 
	to Kira...

					SISKO
				(to Dax)
			If you won't defend yourself, you're 
			not going to testify.

					KIRA
				(to Sisko)
			It's a hearing, not a trial.  She

	Sisko and Kira both regard her -- but Dax remains silent;

			I've made some progress.

					SISKO
			Good.

					ODO
			Not good.
				(off Sisko's reaction)
			Since the transmission to the enemy 
			is the key evidence, I thought it 
			might be a good idea to go through 
			all the communications logs from 
			headquarters during that period... I

					SISKO
			You can't tell me Curzon would log

					ODO
			No.  Nothing like that.  But the log 
			shows a number of conversations 
			between Dax's office and General 
			Tandro's home.

					SISKO
				(so what?)
			They were close friends.

			Maybe it was innocent.  Maybe he was

			support during tough times.
				(beat)
			Or... maybe they were taking advantage 
			of the General's absence to get a

	She takes a beat to gather her thoughts.

					ENINA
			My husband wasn't nearly the hero in 
			life that he was in death, Mister

			No.  You see, I knew the man before

			But I also knew my place in history.  
			I was to carry on bravely, never to 
			remarry.  I was to represent my

			name.  And of course, never to speak 
			of who he really was... because nobody 
			wants to hear that.

					ODO
			They may have to hear it now.

			No matter what's said, they'll still

				(off her silence)
			There are worse things than an illicit

			Are you really willing to commit

					DAX
			Oh, yes.  It's considered a great 
			honor.

					SISKO
			And how did young Jadzia finally 
			become a host candidate?

					DAX
			By winning scholarships... competing 
			against other young people.  You're 
			tested in countless ways.

					SISKO
			Including psychological tests; to 
			determine the strength of character 
			of the prospective host.  Is that 
			true?

					DAX
			Yes.

					SISKO
			And the young Jadzia excelled in 
			those tests of academics and 
			character... of psychological 
			stability.

					DAX
				(softly)
			Yes.

87   CLOSER - SISKO & DAX

	Despite the public forum here, this next moment is a strictly 
	personal one between them:

			If you can remember other things... 
			Remember that as well.

	Dax not only smiles her gratitude for that reminder... she 
	also seems now to sit up just a bit straighter than before.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FIVE              54.

88   RESUME - SHOT

					SISKO
			What academic degrees do you hold, 
			Lieutenant?

					DAX
			I have Premier Distinctions in 
			exobiology, zoology, astrophysics 
			and exoarchaeology.

					SISKO
			How many of those degrees did you 
			earn before you were joined with the 
			symbiont Dax?

					DAX
			All of them.

					SISKO
				(to Renora)
			All of them.  As Jadzia;  Alone.  A 
			brilliant and independent young woman 
			who's done nothing in her life but 
			contribute to her society.
				(turning to Renora)
			Madame Arbiter, how can anyone justify 
			trying her for a crime allegedly 
			committed by another entity before 
			she was even born?

	As Sisko moves back to his own seat, there is total silence 
	throughout the place -- until:

					TANDRO
			This will only take a minute.  
			Lieutenant... As a Trill candidate, 
			did Jadzia fully understand the 
			responsibilities to be assumed upon 
			becoming a Trill?

					DAX
			Yes.

					TANDRO
			Did you willingly accept those 
			responsibilities, and whatever 
			consequences they might entail?

					DAX
			Yes.

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FIVE              55.

88   CONTINUED:

					TANDRO
			And would that not obviously include 
			the consequences of criminal acts 
			committed by Curzon Dax?

					ENINA'S VOICE (O.S.)
			May I speak?

89   INCLUDING ODO & ENINA

	Enina is moving slowly in from the entrance -- Odo alongside, 
	maybe a step behind, her.

90   ON TANDRO

	He rises in surprise.

					TANDRO
			Mother?

91   ON DAX

	Equally surprised -- and concerned -- she also, almost 
	involuntarily, rises.

92   FULL SHOT

					RENORA
			And you are?

					ENINA
			I am Enina Tandro... Widow of General 
			Ardelon Tandro.
				(beat)
			This hearing is unnecessary.  The 
			accusations are... erroneous.

					TANDRO
			What are you talking about?

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FIVE              56.

					ENINA
				(to Renora)
			Madame Arbiter, Curzon Dax is accused 
			of having made a transmission to the 
			enemy that betrayed my husband.  But 
			I know where Curzon was at the exact 
			time that transmission was made.
				(beat)
			He was in my bed... with me.

93   ON DAX

	Anguished for Enina.

94   SISKO

	Much relieved.

95   TANDRO

	Thunderstruck.  The strength leaving his legs, he slips slowly 
	back into his seat.

96   RENORA

					RENORA
			Mister Tandro, I think you'll want 
			to re-examine your extradition 
			request.  Until then... this hearing 
			is adjourned.

	And she punctuates that with a bang of her ball-gavel.

97   FAVORING QUARK

	He shrugs -- the philosophical loser -- and punches out the 
	bad news on his calculator PADD -- as the Ferengi Waiter, 
	the Dabo Girl and Morn converge on him... obscuring him from 
	our further view, during:

					QUARK
			Calm yourselves; all bets'll be 
			paid... An orderly line, please...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FIVE             56A.

97A  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

98   INT. PROMENADE SECOND LEVEL - FAVORING DAX & ENINA

					ENINA
			You were kind to try and protect 
			me... someone you never even met...

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/20/92 - ACT FIVE              57.

					DAX
			There's much of Curzon that's still 
			a part of me.  That still remembers 
			what you had together.

					ENINA
				(shakes her head)
			But it was Curzon Dax who swore 
			himself to silence to preserve the 
			memory of General Tandro... Not 
			Jadzia.

					DAX
			I felt it was important to keep that 
			promise.  The General's memory is 
			cherished by your people...

					ENINA
				(sad reflection)
			And it will continue to be.  No one 
			will ever know he was the one who 
			tried to betray us... and that the 
			rebels killed him for the favor.
				(Beat)
			As for you, I ask only one further 
			kindness...

					DAX
			Of course.

					ENINA
			Live, Jadzia Dax.  Live a long, and 
			fresh and wonderful life.

	Enina runs her palm gently down along Dax's cheek... Turns... 
	walks away.  Dax watches her depart a beat... touches her 
	own hand to the cheek caressed by Enina...

98A  INT. PROMENADE - LOWER LEVEL

	Bashir at the door of the Infirmary, looks over and sees Dax 
	coming down the stairs... moves over to her...

99   CLOSE - DAX

					BASHIR
			Are you all right?

               DEEP SPACE: "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT FIVE              58.

99   CONTINUED:

					DAX
				(beat)
			Yes.  As a matter of fact, I think I 
			am.
				(brightly)
			Don't I recall your offering to escort 
			me safely home?

					BASHIR
			That was four days ago.

					DAX
			Was there a time limit?

					BASHIR
				(great happy grin)
			Hardly.

	He offers his arm, and they start off together.  MUSIC SWELLS 
	from Quark's (O.S.) place.  Business, and everything else, 
	as usual.

									FADE OUT.

                 END OF ACT FIVE                                
                            THE END
