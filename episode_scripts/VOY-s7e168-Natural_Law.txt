[Shuttle]

(flying over a lush green forest)
CHAKOTAY: Beautiful, isn’t it?
SEVEN: A sensor analysis would have provided the necessary information.
CHAKOTAY: Just admiring the view.
SEVEN: The conference begins in less than an hour.
CHAKOTAY: There’s always time for Warp Field Dynamics, but you don’t see
natural beauty like this every day. What was that?
SEVEN: Some kind of energy barrier directly below us. It spans thousands
of square kilometres.
CHAKOTAY: Why didn’t our sensors detect it?
SEVEN: Uncertain. It has an unusual tetrion signature. Species three one
two used a similar technology. There’s a power surge coming from the
barrier.
CHAKOTAY: Shields at full.
SEVEN: They’re creating some kind of feedback. We’ve lost impulse engines.
CHAKOTAY: Go to warp.
SEVEN: The warp core is offline.
CHAKOTAY: Warp engines don’t just shut down when you scrape an energy
barrier.
SEVEN: It’s affecting all our systems.
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in thirty seconds.
CHAKOTAY: We’ll have to beam to the surface.
SEVEN: We can’t transport through the barrier. Transfer auxiliary power
to the weapons array.
CHAKOTAY: What are you trying to do?
SEVEN: If I can realign our phasers to the correct frequency, I may be
able to open a rift.
CHAKOTAY: Big enough to get a shuttle through, I hope.
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in ten seconds, nine, eight.
SEVEN: Phasers reconfigured.

[Jungle]

(Chakotay and Seven beam onto the surface)
SEVEN: The barrier’s closed again. (sees the nasty gash on his leg) I
should examine you.
CHAKOTAY: I don’t think it’s serious.
SEVEN: You have a hairline fracture.
CHAKOTAY: We've got bigger problems. I’ll be fine.
SEVEN: I’m detecting shuttle debris scattered over several square
kilometres.
CHAKOTAY: Some of it might still be functional.
SEVEN: If we can find the right components we may be able to construct a
beacon, send a distress signal.
CHAKOTAY: Through the barrier.
SEVEN: Maybe.
CHAKOTAY: If we hurry we might still make that conference. Well, if we
have to be stranded somewhere, you couldn’t ask for a nicer place.
SEVEN: We wouldn’t be stranded at all if you hadn’t insisted on admiring
the view.

[Delta Flyer]

PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: Guest Vessel 74656, this is Ledos
Port Control. Shut down your engines.
PARIS: This is Lieutenant Tom Paris. Is there a problem?
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: You were observed committing
piloting violation two five six.
PARIS: I'm sorry, I’m not familiar with your regulations. It won’t happen
again.
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: You’ll be informed of the penalty.
PARIS: What kind of penalty?
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: That’s not my decision. Your Docking
Permit says you’re assigned to the Starship Voyager.
PARIS: That’s right.
PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]: Your commanding Officer will be
notified of your infraction.

[Ready Room]

PARIS: Piloting lessons?
JANEWAY: Apparently, the standard penalty for your infraction is a three
day course in flight safety, followed by a test.
PARIS: Well did you explain we wouldn’t be here that long?
JANEWAY: Actually, while you were completing your mission, Seven was
invited to a four day conference.
PARIS: Here on Ledos.
JANEWAY: I decided to give the entire crew shore leave. It'll give you
plenty of time to brush up on your piloting skills.
PARIS: I don’t need lessons.
JANEWAY: Apparently the authorities disagree.
PARIS: But Captain.
JANEWAY: You may not have known the Ledosians’ rules, but you know ours.
Comply with local law. Understood?
PARIS: Yes, ma’am.

[Jungle]

SEVEN: The relays are fused. It’s useless.
CHAKOTAY: Looks like we’re not the only ones here.
SEVEN: Indigenous wildlife perhaps.
CHAKOTAY: I’m reading residual lifesigns. They’re humanoid.
SEVEN: Ledosian?
CHAKOTAY: No, but they share the same genetic traits. Whoever they are,
they may be able to help us.
SEVEN: Unless they’re hostile.
CHAKOTAY: Why don’t we give them the benefit of the doubt. The lifesigns
lead in that direction.
SEVEN: I suggest you rest your leg while I investigate.
CHAKOTAY: It’s better is we stick together, at least until we know
whether they’re hostile.

[Clearing]

CHAKOTAY: I’m guessing they’re pre-warp.
SEVEN: Obviously they can’t help us.
CHAKOTAY: No, I don’t suppose they can, but they’re fascinating, aren't
they? I never expected to run into people like these on such a
technologically advanced planet.
SEVEN: This isn’t an anthropological mission, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: You’re right. We should keep searching for debris. (collapses
in pain)
SEVEN: You’re developing an infection. You should rest.
CHAKOTAY: I’ll have to stay here and try to keep out of sight.
SEVEN: I’ll contact you if I find anything useful.
CHAKOTAY: I guess I don’t have to tell you to avoid interacting with
these people.

SEVEN: (finds another piece of debris) Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

SEVEN [OC]: Commander respond. I’ve found something. (he wakes to see
three natives. One grabs his comm. badge and smashes it with a stone)
Seven of Nine to Chakotay

[Cave - night]

SEVEN: Step away from him.
CHAKOTAY: It’s all right, Seven. They’re friendly. They’re treating my
wound.
SEVEN: You said we were supposed to avoid interaction.
CHAKOTAY: They found me. There was nothing I could do.
SEVEN: You should have tried to contact me.
CHAKOTAY: I didn’t want to expose them to our technology.
SEVEN: You hid your comm. badge.
CHAKOTAY: Actually, your call scared them. They broke it.
SEVEN: I suggest we leave before they break anything else.
CHAKOTAY: Look, they’re friendly and I am hurt.
SEVEN: What are you suggesting?
CHAKOTAY: We may as well stay the night.
SEVEN: Commander.
CHAKOTAY: It’s good shelter, and my leg feels better since they put this
dressing on. I’m going to get some rest. I suggest you do the same.

[Corridor]

KIM: Chell says we shouldn’t miss the Flame Gardens.
NEELIX: I hear the arboretum is beautiful, too.
TORRES: We can do both.
KIM: Tom! You joining us? Oh, that’s right, you have to go to pilot
school.
TORRES: I hear the course takes days.
PARIS: Yeah, for most people, but I did a little research. If the
instructor agrees, you can skip the lessons and go right to the test, so
I will be seeing you in a couple of hours.
NEELIX: I have to admire his optimism.

[Transporter Room]

TRANSPORTER OPERATOR: Just a moment, sir.
KLEG: I am Mister Kleg, the flying instructor. Are you Lieutenant Paris?
KIM: He is.
PARIS: It’s an honour to meet you, sir. May I show you to the Delta Flyer?
KLEG: Why?
PARIS: So you can explain what I did wrong, and then administer the test.
KLEG: It sounds to me like you need lessons in patience as well.
TORRES: Oh, Tom is very patient, sir.
NEELIX: Never impulsive.
KIM: Take all the time you need. He’ll enjoy the extra attention.
KLEG: Well I’m please to hear it. We’ll start with a review of safety
procedures. Do you have a visual display system I can access?
PARIS: I think I can find one.
TORRES: Have fun.
KIM: Energise.
PARIS: So how long will this review take?
KLEG: Oh, typically about four hours, but there's no rush.
PARIS: Of course not.

[Clearing - day]

(Chakotay is drawing a map in the dust)
CHAKOTAY: River. (pours water onto line) River. Mountain. (points to it)
Mountain.
(male native responds with hand gestures)
CHAKOTAY: Where are we?
(male points on ground, then touches Chakotay's rank insignia)
CHAKOTAY: This? You want to trade. Well, I suppose it can't hurt. I'll
take that as a thank you.
SEVEN: Did you make a favourable exchange?
CHAKOTAY: I didn't want to insult their customs. Any luck?
SEVEN: I may have found a way of communicating.
CHAKOTAY: Me too. I've learned to say thank you.
SEVEN: I was referring to communication with Voyager. It may be possible
to construct a beacon by connecting these components to the shuttle's
deflector.
CHAKOTAY: Did you find it?
SEVEN: I detected it six kilometres from here. I believe it's intact.
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I'm up to that long a trip.
SEVEN: I'll go.
CHAKOTAY: I've started mapping the area. Here's the river we passed, this
is where we beamed down, and we're here now.
SEVEN: Then the deflector should be approximately here.
CHAKOTAY: Six kilometres is a long way. Maybe one of them could guide you.
SEVEN: I'm still trying to limit our contact with these people.
CHAKOTAY: The sooner you get to the deflector, the sooner we can get out
of here. They know the terrain. Maybe they can get you there faster.
SEVEN: And watch me construct a tetrion-based signalling device.
CHAKOTAY: All right, but be careful. Seven. This is how they say goodbye.
(Seven goes off, manages to trip over a tree root and lose her tricorder
down a rabbit hole)
(a native makes Chakotay a crutch)
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. (hobbles over to another group) Hello. (sees they
are painting copies of his tattoo on each other)

[Jungle]

(it's dark, a storm is brewing and Seven has just found that she is
walking in circles)
SEVEN: Identify yourself. (a native girl comes and gives her a blanket,
then uses stones and oils from the plants to make a fire.) An exothermic
reaction. (she offers a stick of dried food) I'm not hungry.

[Shuttlebay - Delta Flyer]

KLEG: Inadequate system integration, visibility impaired by lateral
sensor array, insufficient console accessibility.
PARIS: You know, I couldn't agree more. Those are some of the defects
that led to my so-called pilot error.
KLEG: Polarity thrusters. They've been known to cause accidental
acceleration.
PARIS: Exactly my point. Why should I be held responsible for the ship's
design flaws?
KLEG: According to the maintenance records you were this vessel's chief
designer.
I make it a point of professional pride to research every case I'm
assigned to. Are you familiar with that term, Lieutenant? Professional
pride?
PARIS: Yes, sir. In fact, that is why I'm so eager to get underway. I
want to prove to you that I'm a good pilot.
KLEG: There are protocols, Mister Paris. System by system diagnostics,
pre-flight simulations.
PARIS: You must have other students who need your attention. It wouldn't
be fair to
KLEG: Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'm planning to spend as much time with
you as you need.

[Jungle - day]

SEVEN: Good morning. (the girl offers food again. This time it is
accepted. Seven draws a map in the dirt) I’m trying to go here. Can you
show me? (they walk on) Yes. I thought it was this way. (the girl shows
her a triple waterfall) Yes. It’s quite an impressive view. Now we really
have to. (but the girl sits to look for a while)

[Clearing]

CHAKOTAY: My friend, she hasn’t come back. I need to find her. (draws in
the dirt) She looks like this. Where? (the native man brings another girl
to him, with a piece of shuttle debris tied to her forehead) Where'd you
get this? (they show him a bag full of metal bits) My friend. Where?

[Rocky Area with large piece of shuttle debris]

SEVEN: Don’t touch that, please.

[Astrometrics]

JANEWAY: Problem?
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay failed to report in at the scheduled time. We
tried hailing, but there was no response.
KIM: We contacted the conference co-ordinator. He said Seven and Chakotay
never showed up.
JANEWAY: Anything on sensors?
KIM: We've located a hull signature over the southern subcontinent, but
it’s only a wing.
JANEWAY: Nothing else? No lifesigns?
KIM: No, ma’am.
JANEWAY: That’s awfully low for something to be in orbit.
TUVOK: It’s not in orbit. It’s resting on an energy barrier.
KIM: We think the shuttle may have collided with it.
JANEWAY: Why didn’t they see it?
TUVOK: Standard scans didn’t reveal its presence. We were only able to
detect it with our Borg sensors.
JANEWAY: If all you found was a wing, maybe the rest of the shuttle made
it through the barrier.
TUVOK: Logic suggests that possibility. Unfortunately, the barrier's
deflecting all our scans. There’s no way to know if the shuttle or its
occupants are on the other side.
JANEWAY: Hail the Ledosian ambassador.

[Bridge]

AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: We’d have warned your Commander, but his
flight plan didn’t go anywhere near that area.
JANEWAY: He must have altered his route for some reason.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: And collided with the barrier. I’m sorry.
JANEWAY: We’re not assuming they’re dead.
TUVOK: We believe they may have found a way through.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: That’s very unlikely.
JANEWAY: They’re resourceful people. Can you tell us anything about the
barrier?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: It shields the territory of an indigenous
society, the Ventu.
JANEWAY: Then the area’s habitable. If you lowered the barrier, we could
scan for our people’s lifesigns.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I’m afraid we can’t do that.
JANEWAY: Why not?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: It was erected by aliens, hundreds of years
ago. They haven’t been back. The technology is a mystery to us.
TUVOK: Why did these aliens build the barrier?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: To protect the Ventu.
JANEWAY: From whom?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Us. Our ancestors fought them, polluted their
habitat. I’m afraid we weren’t very enlightened back then.
JANEWAY: Earth went through its dark periods too, Ambassador. Would you
have any objections if we tried to lower the barrier, just to scan for
our people?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I told you it’s not possible.
TUVOK: Perhaps if you gave us information about the barrier’s power
source?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: The generator is inside. There’s no way to
access it. Even if your people did survive, I’m afraid there’s no way to
get them out.

Captain’s Log, Stardate 54827.7. Although the Ledosians are sceptical,
they’re allowing us to try to locate our people. Meanwhile, we've begun
to analyse the shuttle fragments.

[Engineering]

TORRES: The burn patterns suggest a tetrion flux.
TUVOK: We found a reference to similar technology in Seven’s Borg
database.
JANEWAY: You think the Borg erected it?
TUVOK: No, but it may’ve been constructed by people they later
assimilated. Species three one two.
JANEWAY: If Seven were here, she might be able to figure out a way to get
through it.
TORRES: Maybe she already did. Some of the damage to the wing was caused
by feedback from the shuttle’s phasers.
JANEWAY: Seven and Chakotay might’ve used them to penetrate the barrier
for some reason.
TUVOK: If I can determine the appropriate frequency, I may be able to do
the same thing, but there is risk involved.
JANEWAY: What sort of risk?
TORRES: It looks like the feedback from the barrier is what destroyed the
shuttle. If we’re not careful the same thing could happen to Voyager.

[Rocky Area with large piece of shuttle debris]

(the girl is making bracelets from pieces of magnetic rock. Seven's
device arcs energy to a nearby group of pebbles and fails.)
SEVEN: May I see those?
CHAKOTAY: (arrives with male native) Seven, is everything all right?
SEVEN: I need your tricorder.
CHAKOTAY: Nice to see you too.
SEVEN: I lost mine. There’s a strong magnetic field here that’s
preventing me from generating a deflector beam, but the field drops off
approximately four point eight kilometres in that direction.
CHAKOTAY: Can you transmit the signal from there?
SEVEN: Not through the barrier, but I may be able to neutralise it by
generating a dampening field with our deflector.
CHAKOTAY: Even if you’re right, this must weight five hundred kilos. How
would we move it?
SEVEN: Some of them could help us.
CHAKOTAY: We shouldn’t involve them.
SEVEN: Do I detect a change in attitude, Commander?
CHAKOTAY: Your concern was justified. They’ve been gathering debris from
the shuttle, using it to imitate us. I don’t want them helping.
SEVEN: What’s the alternative? Staying here, allowing them to find all of
the debris? If we neutralise the barrier, Voyager can transport us and
our technology off the surface.
CHAKOTAY: Is there a possibility that this dampening field could disrupt
the barrier permanently?
SEVEN: Unlikely. Once the deflector is deactivated the barrier should
reinitialise.
CHAKOTAY: Let’s hope you’re right.

[Delta Flyer]

KLEG: So you can execute a turn at less than three hundred kph. Well
done, Lieutenant.
PARIS: Thanks. You know, I don’t want to seem impatient again, but is
there any way you’d let me take that test now?
KLEG: I thought I’d made myself clear about that. All my students
complete the entire course.
PARIS: I understand, sir, but two of my friends are missing, and I’d like
to help find them.
KLEG: Well, that’s an admirable sentiment, but if I give you special
treatment it wouldn’t be fair to the others who have to take this course.
Besides, why stop now? You’re getting very close to becoming an adequate
pilot.

[Rocky Rise]

SEVEN: Here. (to natives) Not so close.

[Bridge]

KIM: Phasers are starting to overload.
JANEWAY: Can we divert any more power to the shields?
TUVOK: The shields are amplifying the feedback.
TORRES: The barrier's interfering with every system we activate.
JANEWAY: Cease fire. I’m open to suggestions.
TUVOK: We may be able to reconfigure a photon torpedo to detonate at the
appropriate frequency.
JANEWAY: What about feedback?
TUVOK: A torpedo shouldn’t create any, theoretically.
JANEWAY: Do it.

[Rocky Rise]

SEVEN: They’re too close.
CHAKOTAY: Back, behind the rise. Stay back.
(Seven starts up the deflector, as the girl sneaks around for a closer
look)

[Bridge]

KIM: The energy barrier’s coming down.
JANEWAY: I thought you were still reconfiguring the torpedo.
TUVOK: I am. It’s being deactivated from the inside.
JANEWAY: Harry, scan for lifesigns.
KIM: Aye, Captain.

[Rocky Rise]

SEVEN: (sees girl about to touch the shuttle debris while wearing a
magnetic bracelet) Take it off!
(the girl gets zapped with energy)

[Bridge]

KIM: I’m only reading one combadge. It’s Seven’s.
JANEWAY: Open a channel. Janeway to Seven.

[Rocky Rise]

JANEWAY [OC]: Are you and Chakotay all right?
SEVEN: Yes, Captain.
JANEWAY [OC]: Stand by for transport.
SEVEN: Lock on to Commander Chakotay. I need more time.
JANEWAY [OC]: Is there a problem?
SEVEN: Someone’s been injured. She requires medical attention.
JANEWAY [OC]: Do you need the Doctor?
SEVEN: I believe I can treat her. A medkit would be useful.
JANEWAY [OC]: Acknowledged.

Captain's log, supplemental. Seven has remained on the surface to tend to
the injured Ventu girl, while Chakotay's being treated in Sickbay.

[Sickbay]

EMH: The poultice healed the fracture and the infection. I’m impressed.
CHAKOTAY: They’re impressive people. I just hope we haven’t traumatised
them.
JANEWAY: You did what you had to do to get out of there.
CHAKOTAY: Still, I think we transport all the shuttle debris back to
Voyager as soon as possible.
JANEWAY: Agreed.

[Cave]

(girl wakes up)
SEVEN: Would you like some breakfast? I’m not hungry either. I admire
your curiosity but you should be more careful. It’s time for me to leave.
Back to my home. (the girl offers her the blanket) That’s very kind, but
I have no use for it. I supposed I should respect your customs. Thank you.
BARUS [OC]: Look at these botanical specimens.

[Clearing]

BARUS: Catalogue those foliates.
SEVEN: Explain your presence here.
BARUS: You must be from Voyager.
SEVEN: Who are you?
BARUS:: My name is Barus. I’m the expedition leader.
SEVEN: What kind of expedition are you leading?
BARUS: We’re conducting scans to evaluate the potential of this habitat.
SEVEN: Potential for what?
BARUS: Anthropological research, resource development. We’ve been waiting
years for this.
SEVEN: What about the people who live here?
BARUS: We’ll help them, of course.
SEVEN: How?
BARUS: With medicine, infrastructure, education. Whoever lowered this
barrier did the Ventu a great favour.

[Ready Room]

CHAKOTAY: That barrier has to go back up.
SEVEN: Isn’t it possible the Ledosians will improve the lives of the
Ventu?
CHAKOTAY: Improve them? How?
SEVEN: They’re intelligent people. Exposure to education and technology
may give them better opportunities.
CHAKOTAY: Can you honestly say that you know what’s better for them?
SEVEN: No, I can’t.
JANEWAY: Then what do you think we should do?
SEVEN: I’m uncertain.
JANEWAY: It’s not like you to be on the fence.
SEVEN: When Commander Chakotay and I first encountered the Ventu, I found
them primitive, of little interest to me, but as I spent time with them I
came to realise that they’re a resourceful, self-reliant people. Their
isolation may limit their potential, but if that isolation ends so will a
unique way of life.

[Bridge]

AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: We appreciate your help in opening this
territory to exploration, Captain. It’s an unprecedented opportunity.
JANEWAY: A short-lived opportunity, I’m afraid.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I don’t understand.
JANEWAY: After I transport our deflector back to Voyager, the energy
barrier will go back up.
TUVOK: Naturally, you’ll want to get your people out, so they won’t be
trapped inside, as ours were.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: You have no right to limit our access to our
own territory.
JANEWAY: I’m not trying to do that, but we have a strict policy about
leaving our technology in the hands of other cultures. It often has
damaging consequences.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I don’t think you realise how important this
is. It’s not only the resources that interest us. The Ventu are our
evolutionary ancestors, our living history.
JANEWAY: I understand this is disappointing for you, but I’m afraid I
have no choice.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: In the spirit of co-operation, I hope you'll
reconsider.
JANEWAY: We’re eager to resume course. Would an hour be enough time to
evacuate your people?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I’ll make the arrangements.

KIM: We’ve transported all the remaining debris to the Cargo Bay.
SEVEN: I have a lock on the deflector assembly.
JANEWAY: What is it?
TUVOK: There’s a Ledosian vessel on an intercept course. It’s charging
weapons.
JANEWAY: Shields!
TUVOK: Direct hit to the transporters. They’re offline.
JANEWAY: Get a weapons lock and hail them.
KIM: They’re hailing us.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Captain Janeway.
JANEWAY: What's going on?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Our government has decided not to let you
restore the barrier.
JANEWAY: And that justifies an unprovoked attack?
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: We only targeted your transporters to avoid
harming your crew. I hope you’ll show the same restraint.
JANEWAY: I don’t find weapons fire of any kind restrained.
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: If you want to avoid further conflict, I
suggest you leave.
JANEWAY: Take us out of orbit.
CHAKOTAY: What about the deflector?
JANEWAY: Is Tom still in the Flyer?
KIM: Yes, ma’am.
JANEWAY: Hail him.

[Delta Flyer]

KLEG: Excellent, Mister Paris. Now come about slowly.
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Paris. Respond.
KLEG: Captain, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t interrupt my student
during his examination.
JANEWAY [OC]: I’m sorry

[Bridge]

JANEWAY: but something’s come up.
PARIS: [OC]: What is it, Captain?
JANEWAY: Tom, I’m sending you some encrypted orders.

[Delta Flyer]

PARIS: Yes, ma’am.
KLEG: This is highly irregular. You’re going much too fast.
PARIS: Yes, sir. I’m in a bit of a hurry.
KLEG: If you have any desire to pass this test, you will reduce your
speed immediately.
PARIS: I wish I could do that, sir. I really do.
KLEG: What was that?
PARIS: Paris to Voyager.

[Bridge]

PARIS [OC]: I'm under attack.
JANEWAY: Give him some help, Mister Tuvok.

[Delta Flyer]

(beams the Ledosian expedition party aboard)
BARUS: What have you done?
PARIS: We had to get you out of there before we close the barrier.
BARUS: You can't do that.
PARIS: (puts up forcefield) Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Paris to
Voyager. I've got them.

[Bridge]

CHAKOTAY: Find the deflector.

[Delta Flyer]

PARIS: I'm getting a lock on it now. (weapons hit) My transporters are
offline.

[Bridge]

JANEWAY: You'd better get out of there, Tom.
PARIS [OC]: Not yet.

[Delta Flyer]

PARIS: I've got an idea.
KLEG: I'm sorry to inform you, Mister Paris, but you have failed this
examination. You will no longer be allowed to operate a vessel within
Ledosian space.
PARIS: Something tells me that's not going to be a problem.
(swoops down, phasers the deflector into molecules and gets out as the
barrier closes)

[Cargo Bay]

CHAKOTAY: This is a beautiful blanket.
SEVEN: Take it if you'd like. I don't need it.
CHAKOTAY: If environmental systems ever go down, you might get cold. You
know, I wanted
SEVEN: I'd like to
CHAKOTAY: You first.
SEVEN: Please, continue.
CHAKOTAY: In all the excitement, I never apologised.
SEVEN: For what?
CHAKOTAY: Causing you to miss that conference.
SEVEN: As a matter of fact, I wanted to thank you for that.
CHAKOTAY: I thought you were angry.
SEVEN: I was, but you were right. Warp Mechanics can be studied any time.
The Ventu, on the other hand.
CHAKOTAY: Is something's still bothering you?
SEVEN: I'm concerned for their well-being.
CHAKOTAY: They know how to take care of themselves.
SEVEN: That's not what I mean. Members of the Ledosian expedition had the
opportunity to scan my deflector modifications. In time, they may find a
way to duplicate out technology and remove the barrier themselves.
CHAKOTAY: I supposed it's possible.
SEVEN: If I'd never made those modifications.
CHAKOTAY: We might still be stranded there. I don't know about you, but
I'm glad to be back on Voyager.
SEVEN: As am I.
